History
UTC+09:45 had been used as a time in Australia (Central Western Summer Time, or CWST). It was used by some roadhouses along the Eyre Highway in South Australia and Western Australia during summer while South Australia is on daylight saving time. Although it is not an official, government mandated time zone, the boundaries where it commences and ends are clearly defined and are usually shown on road maps of the area.  

UTC+09:45 has been used in 5 places in Australia, including Border Village, Caiguna, Eucla, Madura and Mundrabilla. At the moment, these areas use UTC+08:45 because Western Australia does not use daylight saving time.

Alumni AcademiaFort Fetterman was constructed in 1867 by the United States Army on the Great Plains frontier in Dakota Territory, approximately 11 miles northwest of present-day Douglas, Wyoming. Located high on the bluffs south of the North Platte River, it served as a major base for the start of several United States military expeditions against warring Native American tribes. The fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History
Fort Fetterman was built as a major supply point for the United States army's operations in the area. Established on July 19, 1867, by Companies A, C, H, and I of the 4th U.S. Infantry under the command of Major William E. Dye, the fort was named in honor of Captain William J. Fetterman, who was killed in a battle with Indians near Fort Phil Kearny on December 21, 1866.

""It contained quarters for three hundred enlisted men, and the necessary officers; the various magazines and store-houses required for the preservation of ammunition, rations and other supplies; a hospital with fifteen beds; stables for fifty horses; a corral capable of holding fifty-six mule wagons, with their animals; a theatre, an ice-house, a root-house, a granary, a bake-house, blacksmith shops, saw-mill, saddlers' shop, paint shop, laundresses' quarters and a steam engine for pumping water from the North Platte River.""

With the completion of Fort Fetterman, the army abandoned Fort Caspar and moved its garrison into the new fort in August.  As it was on the south side of the Platte, Fort Fetterman was excluded from the provisions of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which resulted in the US abandonment of all forts further to the north: forts Reno, Phil Kearny, and C.F. Smith). Thus, Fort Fetterman became the northernmost military post in eastern Wyoming.  It was important to the protection of the Bozeman Trail and other routes for settlers.

Given its remote location, the post was not considered a desirable station. Desertions by soldiers were frequent, and the winters long and hard.  Supplies had to be brought in by wagon from Fort Laramie to the southeast or from Medicine Bow Station on the railroad.  Soldiers had to carry water up the steep bluffs from the river or nearby creek.  The soil proved to be unsuitable for sustaining gardens, so fresh vegetables were not available.

In 1876, during the Great Sioux War with the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes, the monotony of garrison duty at Fetterman was broken by a series of major military expeditions that set out from the fort. The Big Horn Expedition, which included three of the post's four companies under the command of Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds, culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Powder River in March. The Yellowstone Expedition led by Brigadier General George Crook engaged in the Battle of Rosebud in June, and the Powder River Expedition under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie destroyed a Cheyenne village in November during the Dull Knife Fight. Fort Fetterman remained active until 1882, when it was abandoned by the Army as the Indian Wars had subsided.

A small community (Fetterman City) was started around the empty fort by Charles Henry King and others as an outfitting point for area ranchers and for wagon trains.  When the town of Douglas was established eleven miles away in 1886, Fetterman City rapidly declined.

State Historic Site
The old fort deteriorated from neglect. Today, the partially restored site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is administered as an historic site by the State of Wyoming.  Visitors can walk an interpretive trail to view the ruins of the fort's buildings.  An officers' quarters and an ordnance warehouse have been restored and contain exhibits, artifacts and dioramas about the fort's history, Fetterman City and area Native Americans.

72,4,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type5,"Michael Enoch Isaac Peinovich (born 1977) more commonly known as Mike Enoch, is an American neo-Nazi, antisemitic conspiracy theorist, Holocaust denier, blogger, and podcast host. He founded the alt-right media network The Right Stuff and podcast The Daily Shoah. He is the chairman of the National Justice Party.

In early 2017, while operating his antisemitic media network under the pseudonym Mike Enoch, he was doxxed by fellow neo-Nazis. Most notably, the dox revealed that the neo-Nazi Peinovich was married to a Jewish woman, and that their wedding had featured traditional Jewish rites and chanting. Prior to the dox, Peinovich's wife had appeared as a guest on The Daily Shoah, in which she had concealed her ethnicity while promoting antisemitic memes. 

In addition to his founding of a neo-Nazi media network, Peinovich has drawn attention for his role in organizing book burnings.

Early life

Peinovich's parents divorced at a young age. He is of Norwegian and Serbian descent. Peinovich attended Columbia High School. While in high school, Peinovich worked jobs delivering pizzas and chemically testing pools. After graduating high school, he attended and dropped out of several universities before becoming a computer programmer who worked at an e-publishing company.

Early media coverage 
Peinovich first drew media attention for his use of the  ""Sieg Heil"" salute at a conference organized by Richard B. Spencer to celebrate Donald Trump's election as President. The salutes were performed in front of journalists, and footage of the speech and the Peinovich-inspired salutes was circulated by the mainstream media. According to Andrew Marantz, the event marginalized the alt-right by defining it to the public as a neo-Nazi movement, and led to an exodus of Trump supporters.

The Right Stuff

The Right Stuff is a white nationalist, neo-fascist neo-Nazi blog founded by Peinovich that hosts several podcasts, including The Daily Shoah and Fash the Nation. The blog is best known for popularizing the use of triple parentheses to identify Jews on social media. The Daily Shoah is a far-right podcast, hosted on TDS. Its name uses the Hebrew word referring to the Holocaust. The podcast also uses the triple parentheses symbol.

Doxing incident
In January 2017, users of the imageboard website 8chan leaked the identities of several of its key contributors, including Peinovich, and revealed that his wife was Jewish and that their wedding had featured traditional Jewish rites and chanting. Prior to the dox, Peinovich's wife had appeared as a guest on The Daily Shoah, in which she had concealed her ethnicity while promoting antisemitic memes. Through his work, Peinovich ridicules African Americans, Jews, and other minorities, advocates racial discrimination, and promotes conspiracy theories such as Holocaust denial and white genocide.

Other information released included the names of his family members, his job as a software developer, his home address on Manhattan's Upper East Side neighborhood, and his hometown of Maplewood, New Jersey. After initially attempting to deny the reports, Peinovich later admitted that the allegations were true. Though Peinovich initially planned to leave the network, he quickly changed his mind and vowed to continue his activities. However, the fact that the released biographical information about Peinovich contradicted his professed ideology led many listeners of TDS questioned the authenticity of Peinovich's commitment to the views he espoused on the show.

In an audio statement released on their podcast, Daily Shoah co-host Seventh Son announced that Peinovich and his wife were separating. The revelation was met with mixed but mostly supportive reactions from individuals including David Duke, and Richard B. Spencer.

Peinovich's father asked the latter to change his surname in light of his neo-Nazi political activities.

Political activities

After U.S. Congressman Steve King tweeted praise for Netherlands political candidate Geert Wilders's stance against further immigration to Europe, Peinovich joined other alt-right voices in approval of King's position, stating ""King doubles down. Great job. Take note cucks, this is how you *actually* fight the left.""

On 18 April 2017, Peinovich joined Richard B. Spencer in giving a talk at Auburn University where he expressed that he and the movement were breaking away from the new direction that the Trump administration was taking. While Auburn administration had initially cancelled the planned event, citing safety concerns, Peinovich assisted Spencer in filing a lawsuit on First Amendment grounds. United States federal judge William Keith Watkins issued a ruling requiring Auburn to allow Spencer and Peinovich to speak.

In April 2018, he was retweeted by Ann Coulter following his dissemination of conspiracy theories relating to the Douma chemical attack in Syria claiming it was faked. After Newsweek asked Twitter for a comment, his account was suspended.

In addition to his founding of a neo-Nazi media network, Peinovich has drawn attention for his role in organizing book burnings.

Legal issues 

In October 2017, Peinovich was listed as a defendant in Sines v. Kessler, the federal civil lawsuit against various organizers, promoters, and participants of the 2017 Unite the Right rally. The trial began on October 25, 2021, and the jury reached a verdict on November 23. All defendants other than Peinovich, who had previously been dismissed from the case, were found liable for civil conspiracy under Virginia state law, and ordered to pay $500,000 in punitive damages. The jury were deadlocked on the two other claims pertaining to Peinovich, which argued he and other defendants had engaged in a federal conspiracy to commit racially-motivated violence.

History

Origin
The fief was established in 1607 by a decree from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir to the Islamic clergyman and Iraqi immigrant Syed Shah Pahlowan whose family was initially composed of Muslim preachers and missionaries. The family also claims descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad for which they used the title ""Syed"".

Imperial Services
Mughal Emperor Shahjahan bestowed the title of Mir to the family for commanding Mughal Artillery. Later members of the family also served in the artillery corps of the British Indian Army, Pakistan Army and Bengal Army. In 1971, members of the Estate actively took part in the Bangladesh Liberation War for Bangladesh.

Family
The family frequently intermarried with the members of the Estate of Delduar which is situated in Tangail, Bangladesh. The Padamdi estate is situated beside the river Padma (Ganges) in Bangladesh, and produced notable writers, the most famous of which is Mir Mosharraf Hossain.

Abolition
The estate was taken by the Government in 1954, after the then Pakistan Government seized all landed estates vide a decree to equitably re-distribute the property to the landless poor. The estate was divided into two Thanas (smallest Administrative Units in Bangladesh) - Baliakandi and Pangsha under the district of Rajbari. The family still possesses most of the lands.

Lieutenant Colonel Syed Mir Ali Imam Al Mamun is the present head of the family.

History of BangladeshFrances McEwen Belford (January 13, 1839 — January 27, 1921) was an American activist based in Denver, Colorado, known as the ""Mother of the Lincoln Highway"" for her leadership in creating the coast-to-coast interstate highway named for Abraham Lincoln.

Early life
Frances C. McEwen was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, the daughter of John S. McEwen and Isabella Barkley Highlands McEwen. She met Abraham Lincoln once, in Illinois, soon after he was elected president in 1861.

Career
Belford was known as the ""Mother of the Lincoln Highway"". She addressed women's clubs and she lobbied lawmakers, asking ""And what could be finer evidence of national loyalty than a wide, fair highway, traced through the heart of the land, built, maintained, guarded, beautified by the people of the states traversed by it?""

Belford was the first woman to serve on Colorado's State Board of Charities, Corrections, and Pardons. She was a trustee of the Colorado state teachers' college, and of the state agricultural college as well. Her husband was a Congressman and her neighbor was Sarah Platt-Decker, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, which gave her access to national audiences for her ideas. She chaired the legislative committee of Colorado's Woman's Christian Temperance Union for five years, and spoke on ""Women and the Affairs of the State"" at Colorado's ""Congress of the Women"" in 1901.

Personal life
Frances McEwen married lawyer James Burns Belford in 1860. They had eight children, including a daughter, Frances Belford Wayne, who became a noted journalist in Denver. She was widowed in 1910 and she died in 1921, aged 82 years, in Denver.

A dormitory at the University of Northern Colorado is named Belford Hall after Frances McEwen Belford.

79,6,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type2,"Ľudovít Velislav Štúr (; ; 28 October 1815 – 12 January 1856), known in his era as Ludevít Štúr, was a Slovak revolutionary politician, and writer. As a leader of the Slovak national revival in the 19th century, and the author of the Slovak language standard, he is lauded as one of the most important figures in Slovak history.

Štúr was an organizer of the Slovak volunteer campaigns during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. He was also a politician, poet, journalist, publisher, teacher, philosopher, linguist and member of the Hungarian Parliament.

Background

Language dispute 
At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, Slovaks were divided concerning the literary language to be used:
 Catholics continued to use the standard that had developed in Slovak writing by 1610. Anton Bernolák's language codified in the 1780s was an attempt to blend that standard with the west-Slovak idiom of the university town of Trnava (Nagyszombat), but most authors respected Bernolák's standard only to the degree that it did not diverge from the traditional written standard;
 Most Lutherans diverged from that standard in the late 17th – early 18th century and began to adhere strictly to the archaic language of the Moravian Bible of Kralice, whose imitation became a matter of faith with them during their persecution by the Habsburgs.

This situation did not change until the 1840s, when Ľudovít Štúr became the chief figure of the Slovak national movement.

At the same time, modern nations started to develop in Europe and in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarians favoured the idea of a centralized state, although the Magyar population was only some 40% of the population of the Hungarian Kingdom in the 1780s. This was unacceptable to other national groups, including the Slovaks, and they expressed their disapproval.

Slovak language 
In the 1830s, a new generation of Slovaks began to make themselves heard. They had grown up under the influence of the national movement at the prestigious Lutheran Lýceum (preparatory high school and college) in Bratislava, where the Czech-Slav Society (also called the ""Society for the Czechoslovak Language and Literature"") had been founded in 1829. Initially, the society operated in accordance with the ideas of Ján Kollár, a Protestant minister, poet, and academic, supporter of Czech-Slovak unity, and of the users of the language of Bible of Kralice. In the latter part of the decade, when Ľudovít Štúr came to the fore, its activities intensified. The most prominent representatives of the new generation were, along with Ľudovít Štúr, Jozef Miloslav Hurban (1817–1888) and Michal Miloslav Hodža (1811–1870).

Ľudovít Štúr expressed his philosophy in one sentence: ""My country is my being, and every hour of my life shall be devoted to it"". Štúr, a Lutheran, was aware of the fact that Czech, the language of educated Lutherans, was not enough to carry out a national campaign, and that Slovaks, if they were ever to become autonomous and be an effective force against Magyarization, needed a language they could call their own. The central Slovak dialect was chosen as the basis of a literary language. Štúr's codification work was disapproved of by Ján Kollár and the Czechs, who saw it as an act of Slovak withdrawal from the idea of a common Czecho-Slovak nation and a weakening of solidarity. But the majority of Slovak scholars, including the Catholics (using Bernolák's codification until then), welcomed the notion of codification. The standard language thus became an important political tool.

March 1848 – August 1849 

Štúr's notions (an autonomous Slovak area, a Slovak Diet (assembly), Slovak schools, etc.) came to fruition simultaneously with the 1848 Revolution in Hungary, which dealt with the liberation of peasants from serfdom and other national and ethnic issues. Hungarian revolutionaries called for Hungary’s separation from Vienna, but at the same time, they wanted to see Hungary as one nation with one language and one educational system. But the desires of the Magyars for a centralized Hungarian state ran contrary to the wishes of other national groups, including the Slovaks. Slovak and Hungarian revolutionary claims ran counter to each other.

In the spring of 1848, Slovak leaders spread their ideas throughout Upper Hungary. Slovak nationalists, mainly in the progressive western and central Upper Hungary, joined them. In May 1848, a huge public meeting took place in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš (Liptószentmiklós; present Liptovský Mikuláš), where a pan-Slovak program, known as Žiadosti slovenského národa (""Requirements of the Slovak Nation"") was proclaimed and generally approved. Ethnic Slovaks sought to back this revolutionary manifesto by force of arms. The provisional Hungarian revolutionary government was not willing to accept the “Requirements” document and the situation developed into open hostility between Hungarian and Slovak revolutionaries.

In September 1848, the Slovak National Council was established in Vienna and it forthwith proclaimed the secession of the Slovak territory from Hungary. The so-called September campaign (consisting of 6000 volunteers) took place in western Upper Hungary. Slovak demands remained unfulfilled. Between November 1848 and April 1849, the armed Slovaks helped the Habsburg king – along with imperial troops in present-day Hungary – to defeat Hungarians and their revolutionary government on present-day Slovak territory (the so-called Winter Campaign or Volunteer Campaigns). In March 1849, Slovaks even temporarily managed to start to administer Slovakia themselves and they sent a petition (the March Petition) to the emperor. However, in the summer of 1849, the Russians helped the Habsburg monarchy defeat the revolutionary Hungarians, and in November, when the Slovaks were not needed anymore, the Slovak corps was dissolved in Vienna. Then in December 1851, Emperor Franz Joseph abolished the last vestiges of constitutionalism and began to rule as an absolute emperor. Francis Joseph continued his centralization policies. This came to be known as the period of neo-absolutism. Certain Slovak demands were met, however. In the northern counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Slovak language was allowed for official communication and was introduced in lower schools (see in section Charakteristika of Bachovský absolutizmus resp. Bachove Slovenské noviny). But in higher courts, the Slovaks faced the same Germanization as all the other ethnicities. Ján Kollár, who became a professor at Vienna University, obtained permission to print Slovak newspapers and was appointed a court adviser.

Biography

Early life 
Ľudovít Štúr was born on 28 October 1815 in Uhrovec, in the Austrian Empire (in the same house where Alexander Dubček was later born) as the second child of Samuel and Anna Štúr. He was baptized in the Evangelical Lutheran church in Uhrovec. He acquired his basic education, including the study of Latin, from his father Samuel, who was a teacher. From 1827–1829, he studied in Győr where he attended a lower grammar school. There, he improved his knowledge of history, and the German, Greek, and Hungarian languages. These studies inspired his admiration of Pavel Jozef Šafárik, Ján Kollár and Jiří Dobrovsky. In 1829, he decided to change schools.

From 1829 to 1836, Ľudovít Štúr studied at the prestigious Lutheran Lýceum (preparatory high school and college) in Pressburg and became a member of the Czech-Slav Society, which stimulated his interest in all Slav nations. At the Lýceum was a famous professor, Juraj Palkovič, in the Department of the Czechoslovak Language and Ancient Literature, the only such department at a Protestant school of higher education in 19th century Hungary.

In 1831, Ľudovít Štúr wrote his first poems. From January to September 1834, he temporarily interrupted his studies due to a lack of finances, and returned to Zayugróc, where he worked as a scribe for Count Károly Zay. Later that year, he resumed his studies, was active in the historical and literary circle of the Czech-Slav Society, was responsible for correspondence with members of the Society, gave private lessons in the house of a merchant in Pressburg (today: Bratislava), taught younger students at the Lýceum, and established contacts with important foreign and Czech scholars. On 17 December 1834, he was elected secretary of the Czech-Slav Society at the Lýceum.

Slovak national movement 
In May 1835, Ľudovít Štúr persuaded Jozef Hurban to become involved in the Slovak national movement. Also that year, he was co-editor of the Plody (""Fruits"") almanac, a compilation of the best works of the members of the Czech-Slav Society, including poems of Štúr's. He became vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society, teaching older students at the Lýceum the history of the Slavs and their literatures.

In 1836, Štúr wrote a letter to Czech historian František Palacký, in which he stated that the Czech language used by the Protestants in Upper Hungary had become incomprehensible for ordinary Slovaks, and proposed the creation of a unified Czechoslovak language, provided that the Czechs would be willing to use some Slovak words – just like Slovaks would officially accept some Czech words. But the Czechs were unwilling to accept this, and so Štúr and his friends decided to introduce a completely new Slovak language standard instead. On 24 April 1836, a trip to Devín Castle (Dévény, now part of Bratislava) by the members of the Slovak national movement took place, led by Štúr as the vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society. The beginning of his group's extensive efforts on behalf of national awareness are linked to this visit to the ruins of Devín Castle, woven together with legends and reminders of Great Moravia. The members of the Czech-Slav Society swore here to be true to the national cause, deciding to travel around Upper Hungary to drum up support for their ideas. At the castle, they also adopted additional Slavic names (e.g., Jozef Hurban became Jozef Miloslav Hurban, etc.).

From 1836 to 1838, as deputy (non-stipendiary assistant) for Professor Palkovič, Chair of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature Department at the Lýceum where he was previously a student, he taught History of Slavic Literature. He continued to write poetry and under his leadership, the number of members of the Czech-Slav Society continuously increased. In this year, a poem of Štúr's was published in printed form for the first time: Óda na Hronku (""An ode to Hronka""). In April 1837, the Czech-Slav Society was banned due to a commotion between students at the Lýceum. One week later, Štúr founded the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature, within which the activities of the Czech-Slav Society continued. In that year, he continued to write articles for newspapers and journals, including Tatranka, Hronka, Květy (Czech), Časopis českého musea, Danica (Croatian) and Tygodnik literacki (Polish).

Travels in Germany and early political works 
From 1838 to 1840, he attended the (Protestant) University of Halle in Germany, where he studied linguistics, history, and philosophy. He was influenced by the works of the German philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Johann Gottfried Herder. Also during this period, his poetic cycle Dumky večerní (""Evening Thoughts"", written in Czech) was published in the Czech journal Květy. He left Pressburg for Halle in September 1838. On his way to Halle, he spent more than a month in Prague, in the company of Czech patriots. In the spring of 1839, Štúr made a long journey to the Upper and Lower Lusatia in Germany (inhabited by Slavs) and got in touch with the Slavs there. He wrote the short travelogue Cesta do Lužic vykonaná na jar 1839 (""A journey to Lusatia made in the spring of 1839""), written in Czech and published in the Czech journal Časopis českého musea.

In 1840, he returned to Bratislava via Prague and Hradec Králové (Königgrätz), where he spent some time in the house of publisher Jan Pospíšil. From October, he was once again working as deputy for Professor Palkovič at the Department of the Czecho-Slav Language and Literature at the Evangelical Lutheran Lýceum, teaching courses of grammar and Slav history, and continuing his activities at the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language.

During 1841–1844, Štúr was co-editor of Palkovič's literary magazine, Tatranka. In 1841, he started activities aimed at publishing a Slovak political newspaper. He wrote defenses and polemic texts, as well as his Starý a nový věk Slovákov (""The old and the new age of the Slovaks""), written in Old Czech and published in 1935 (not in Slovak until 1994). On 16 August 1841, Štúr and his friends ascended Kriváň (a symbolic mountain in Slovak culture), an event that is now commemorated by annual excursions to its summit. In 1842, he initiated the first Slovenský prestolný prosbopis, a Slovak petition to the Royal Court in Vienna requiring the government to stop national persecutions by the Hungarians in Upper Hungary. His application for a licence to publish a newspaper was turned down in the same year.

Codification of Slovak 
On 2 February 1843, in Pressburg, Štúr and his friends decided to create a new Slovak language standard (later used as a basis for contemporary literary Slovak), based on central Slovak dialects – a common language that would unify all Slovaks speaking many different dialects. From 26 to 29 June 1843, a special committee met to investigate the Institute of Czechoslovak Language at the Lýceum, also interrogating Štúr.

In July 1843, his defense, Die Beschwerden und Klagen der Slaven in Ungarn über die gesetzwidrigen Übergriffe der Magyaren (""The complaints and grievances of the Slavs in Hungary about the illegal malfeasances of the Hungarians""), which editorial offices throughout 19th century Hungary had refused to publish, was published in Leipzig, Germany. From 11 to 16 July 1843, at the parish house of J. M. Hurban in Hlboké, the leaders of the Slovak national movement – Štúr, J. M. Hurban, and M.M. Hodža – agreed on how to codify the new Slovak language standard and how to introduce it to the public. On 17 July 1843, they visited Ján Hollý, an important writer and representative of the older Bernolák Slovak language standard, in Dobrá Voda and informed him about their plans. On 11 October 1843, although the committee did not find anything illegal about Štúr's activities, Štúr was ordered to stop lecturing and was removed from the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. However, Štúr continued to give lectures. On 31 December 1843, he was definitively deprived of the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. As a result, in March 1844, 22 students left Pressburg in protest; 13 of them went to study at the Evangelical Lýceum in the town of Levoča (Lőcse). One of the supporting students was Janko Matuška, who took the opportunity to write a hymn, ""Nad Tatrou sa blýska"", which later became the official anthem of the Slovak Republic.

From 1843 to 1847, Štúr worked as a private linguist. In 1844, he wrote Nárečja slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí (""The Slovak dialect or, the necessity of writing in this dialect""). On 19 May 1844, a second Slovenský prestolný prosbopis was sent to Vienna, but had little influence. But in 1844, other Slovak authors (often Štúr’s students) started to use the new Slovak language standard. On 27 August, he participated in the founding convention of the Slovak association Tatrín, the first nationwide association.

On 1 August 1845, the first issue of Slovenskje národňje novini (""Slovak National Newspaper"", published until 9 June 1848) was published. One week later, its literary supplement, Orol Tatranský (""The Tatra Eagle"", published until 6 June 1848) was also published. In this newspaper, written in the new Slovak language, he gradually shaped a Slovak political program. He based this on the precept that the Slovaks were one nation, and that they therefore had a right to their own language, culture, schools - and particularly to political autonomy within Hungary. The projected expression of this autonomy was to be a Slovak Diet. Also that year, his brochure Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert und der Magyarismus (""The 19th century and Magyarism""), written in German, was published in Vienna.

Career in the Hungarian Diet 

In 1846, Štúr got to know the well-situated noble family Ostrolúcky in Zemianske Podhradie (Nemesváralja), who later helped him to become a deputy in the Diet of Hungary in Pressburg. He also fell in love with Adela Ostrolúcka. In addition, his books Nárečja Slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí (1844) and Nauka reči Slovenskej (""The Theory of the Slovak language"") were published in Pressburg. In Nárečia Slovenskuo, he rebutted Kollár's concept of only four Slavic tribes (Russians, Poles, Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs), and listed reasons for the introduction of the new language, which was based on central Slovak dialects and used phonetic spelling. In Nauka reči Slovenskej, he explained the grammar of the new language standard. In the same year, the upset Kollár and his followers published the compilation work Hlasové o potřebě jednoty spisovného jazyka pro Čechy, Moravany a Slováky (""Voices in favour of the necessity of a unified literary language of the Czechs, Moravians and Slovaks""), written in Czech.

In August 1847, at the 4th convention of the Tatrín association in Čachtice, Catholics and Protestants proclaimed that they ""definitively agree to use only the newly codified Štúr language standard"". On 30 October 1847, he became an ablegate for the town of Zvolen (Zólyom) in the ""Parlamentum Publicum"" (Diet) in Pressburg. From 17 November 1847 to 13 March 1848, he gave five important speeches at the Diet, in which he demanded the abolition of serfdom in Hungary, the introduction of civil rights, and the use of the Slovak language in elementary schools. The Diet met only until 11 April 1848 due to the 1848 Revolution.

1848/49 Revolution 
On 1 April 1848 in Vienna, Štúr and his colleagues prepared the Slavic Congress of Prague. On 20 April 1848, he arrived in Prague on the invitation of the Czech J. V. Frič, where he won the support of Czech student members of the association Slávie, regarding his attempts to enforce the Slovak language. On 30 April 1848, he initiated the establishment of ""Slovanská lipa"" (Slavic lime tree) in Prague – an association aimed at promoting the mutual cooperation of Slavs.

In May 1848, he was a co-author of the official petition, Žiadosti slovenského národa (""Requirements of the Slovak Nation""). The Žiadosti slovenského národa were publicly declared in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, with Ján Francisci-Rimavský as the reader. In it, the Slovaks demanded autonomy within Hungary, proportional representation in the Hungarian Assembly, the creation of a Slovak Diet to administer their own region, for Slovak to become the official language, and for educational institutions at all levels to use Slovak. They also called for universal suffrage and democratic rights – e.g., freedom of the press and public assembly. They requested that peasants be released from serfdom, and that their lands be returned to them. But on 12 May 1848, the Hungarian government issued a warrant for the leaders of the Slovak movement: Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža. The persecuted Štúr arrived in Prague on 31 May 1848. On 2 June 1848, he participated in the Slavic Congress there.

On 19 June 1848, he went to Zagreb, Croatia, because the Slavic Congress was interrupted by fighting in Prague, and became an editor of the Croatian magazine Slavenski Jug. With financial support from some Serbs, he and J. M. Hurban started to prepare an uprising against the Hungarian government. The ""Slovak Uprising"" occurred between September 1848 and November 1849. In September 1848, Štúr travelled to Vienna and participated in preparations for the Slovak armed uprising. On 15–16 September 1848, the Slovak National Council, the supreme Slovak political and military organisation, consisting of Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža (as politicians), and the Czechs B. Bloudek, F. Zach, and B. Janeček (as military experts), was created in Vienna. On 19 September 1848 in Myjava, the Slovak National Council declared independence from the Hungarian government and called on the Slovak nation to start an armed uprising. However, the Council only managed to control their local region.

Štúr, Hurban, and others met in Prague on 7 October 1848 to discuss how to proceed with the uprising. Upon his return to Vienna in November, Štúr (with a group of Slovak volunteers, on one of the so-called Volunteer Campaigns) traversed northern Hungary from Čadca (Csaca), arriving in Prešov (Eperjes) in March 1849. On 20 March 1849, he led a delegation to meet with the Austrian king in the Czech town of Olomouc and presented the demands of the Slovak nation. From March until June, Štúr – along with Hurban, Hodža, Bórik, Chalúpka, and others – negotiated in Vienna for a solution to the Slovak demands. But on 21 November 1849, the Slovak volunteer corps was officially demobilized in Pressburg, and the disappointed Štúr retreated to his parents' home in Uhrovec.

Later life 
The later years of Štúr's life saw him engage in further linguistic and literary work. In the autumn of 1850, he attempted but failed to receive a license to publish a Slovak national newspaper. In December of that year, he participated in a delegation to Vienna concerning Slovak schools and the Tatrín association. Several personal tragedies also occurred during his later life. His brother Karol died on 13 January 1851. Štúr moved into the house of Karol's family in Modra (near Pressburg) to care for his seven children. He lived there under police supervision. On 27 July 1851, his father died, and his mother moved to Trenčín (Trencsén).

In October 1851, he participated in meetings in Pressburg concerning reforms of the codified Slovak language standard. The reforms, involving mainly a transition from the phonetic spelling to an etymological one, were later introduced by M. M. Hodža and Martin Hattala in 1851–1852, but Štúr, among others, also participated in the preparations. The result of these reforms was the Slovak language standard still in use today, with only some minor changes since then.

In Modra in 1852, Štúr finished his essay O národních písních a pověstech plemen slovanských (""On national songs and myths of Slavic kin""), written in Czech and published in Bohemia the next year. In addition, he wrote his important philosophical book, Das Slawenthum und die Welt der Zukunft (""Slavdom and the world of the future""), written in German, and published in Russian in 1867 and 1909 (subsequently published in German in 1931, and in Slovak in 1993). Among other things, he recapitulated the events that brought the Slovaks to the desperate situation of that time, and suggested cooperation with Russia as a solution, thus moving away from Slovak nationalism toward pan-Slavism.

In 1853, his platonic female friend, Adela, died in Vienna on 18 March. He also went to Trenčín to help care for his ill mother, until she died on 28 August. The only compilation of his poetry, Spevy a piesne (""Singings and songs""), was published in Pressburg that year. On 11 May 1854, he gave a speech at the unveiling of the Ján Hollý monument in Dobrá Voda (Ján Hollý having died in 1849). Štúr had also written a poem in his honour.

On 22 December 1855, Štúr accidentally shot and wounded himself during a hunt near Modra. In the last days of his life, he was mainly supported by his friend Ján Kalinčiak. On 12 January 1856, Ľudovít Štúr died in Modra. A national funeral was held there in his honour.

Legacy 
Štúr has been featured on Czechoslovak and Slovak banknotes throughout the 20th century. He has appeared on the Czechoslovakian 50 Koruna note of 1987 and on the Slovakian 500 Koruna note since 1993. 

The town of Parkan (Párkány in Hungarian) on the Hungarian border was renamed in his honour, though without the agreement of the town's residents, as Štúrovo in 1948.

The asteroid 3393 Štúr, about 9.6 km in diameter and discovered on 28 November by Milan Antal at the Hungarian observatory at Piszkéstető, is named after him.

Despite the importance of his work in defining the Slovak literary standard and orthography, he was an anti-semite; he opposed Jewish emancipation and promoted the divisive claim that Slovak Jews could not belong to the Slovak nation.

Participants of the Slavic Congress in Prague 1848Berney Arms is a remote settlement on the north bank of the River Yare, close to Breydon Water in the English county of Norfolk. It is part of the civil parish of Reedham, is in the district of Broadland and lies within The Broads. It comprises a railway station, a windmill, a farmhouse and a pub which closed in late 2015 (though permission for conversion to a dwelling was refused, and campaigners are seeking to reopen it as a pub). , an adjacent property has opened as a bistro. The area is not accessible by public road.

Geography
Berney Arms is in an area of marshland, much of which is at or below sea level. It lies on the River Yare just to the west of Breydon Water. The area is part of Berney Marshes RSPB reserve and within the Halvergate Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest. These provide important habitats for a range of plant and invertebrate species as well as providing important wintering grounds for bird species such as Bewick's swan. The area is also a Ramsar Site and part of the Broadland Special Protection Area. Ashtree Farm is used by the RSPB as a series of dwellings and as its base for the marshes.

Berney Arms can be reached only by train, by boat or on foot and has no public road access, with only a private track running to it. Berney Arms railway station is a request stop on the Norwich–Great Yarmouth line via . It is served by a limited number of services each day, with a more frequent service on Sundays. Berney Arms is on the Weavers' Way and Wherryman's Way footpaths.

History
Berney Arms takes its name from The Berney Arms public house, which is situated by the staithe on the north bank of the River Yare and served walkers and boaters who pass through the area.  It was closed in 2015 and the owner proposed to turn the pub into a private house, but planning permission was refused. The public house was named after the landowner Thomas Trench Berney who owned the Reedham Cement Works centred on the Berney Arms Windmill.  The mill was built in 1865 and is the tallest windmill in Norfolk at  tall. It was used to grind cement clinker and was later converted into a drainage mill. It closed in 1948 and is now a Scheduled Monument in the care of English Heritage. At one point the mill supported a small settlement of 11 domestic dwellings and a chapel. Berney sold the land on which the railway was built, on the condition that a stopping place was built to serve the settlement in perpetuity.

Berney Arms was mentioned in Arthur Ransome's popular children's book Coot Club, which is in the Swallows and Amazon series.

27,7,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type1,"Antifolates are a class of antimetabolite medications that antagonise (that is, block) the actions of folic acid (vitamin B9). Folic acid's primary function in the body is as a cofactor to various methyltransferases involved in serine, methionine, thymidine and purine biosynthesis. Consequently, antifolates inhibit cell division, DNA/RNA synthesis and repair and protein synthesis. Some such as proguanil, pyrimethamine and trimethoprim selectively inhibit folate's actions in microbial organisms such as bacteria, protozoa and fungi. The majority of antifolates work by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).

Comparison of available agents

Mechanism
Many are primarily DHFR inhibitors, but raltitrexed is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, and pemetrexed inhibits both and a third enzyme.

Antifolates act specifically during DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus are cytotoxic during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Thus, they have a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as malignant and myeloid cells, and GI & oral mucosa), which replicate their DNA more frequently, and thus inhibits the growth and proliferation of these non-cancerous cells as well as causing the side-effects listed.

Limitations

Side-effects
The antifolate action specifically targets the fast-dividing cells, and tend to have adverse effects on the bone marrow, skin, and hair.  As folate is vital in the first trimester of pregnancy for healthy fetal development, the use of antifolates is strongly contraindicated in pregnancy and carries significant teratogenic risk.

Low doses of methotrexate can deplete folate stores and cause side-effects that are similar to folate deficiency. Both high-folate diets and supplemental folic acid may help reduce the toxic side-effects of low-dose methotrexate without decreasing its effectiveness.
Anyone taking low-dose methotrexate for the health problems listed above should consult with a physician about the need for a folic acid supplement.

Resistance
While the role of folate as a cancer treatment is well established, its long-term effectiveness is diminished by cellular response. In response to decreased tetrahydrofolate (THF), the cell begins to transcribe more DHF reductase, the enzyme that reduces DHF to THF. Because methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of DHF reductase, increased concentrations of DHF reductase can overcome the drugs inhibition.

Many new drugs are under development to reduce antifolate drug resistance.

Images

Drugs that incidentally antagonize folate
The name antifolate usually refers to drugs whose folate antagonism is intentional. In contrast, there are some other drugs, of several drug classes, that antagonize folate incidentally, as an adverse effect, whether mildly or heavily. This effect is often not noticeable except when it causes a neural tube defect in a fetus carried by a woman taking the medication. Such drugs include some anticonvulsants (valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) and trimethoprim. Lamotrigine is also an anticonvulsant with known (from in vitro testing) weak anti-folate effects.

1940s birthsThe Minnesota North Stars were an American professional ice hockey team based in Bloomington, Minnesota, a city in the U.S. metropolitan statistical area of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The team joined the NHL in 1967 as an expansion team with five other teams; the Cleveland Barons, another 1967 NHL expansion team, were merged with the North Stars in the 1978–79 season. The North Stars played in the Stanley Cup Finals twice: as the Prince of Wales Conference champions in the 1980–81 season, and in the 1990–91 season after winning the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, but lost in both Finals. The North Stars played their home games at the Met Center. The team relocated to Dallas, Texas in 1993, after former owner Norman Green announced that he was moving the team to Dallas's Reunion Arena in search of a better economic situation, and are now known as the Dallas Stars. The North Stars played in the Norris Division of the Clarence Campbell Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL) in their last season. There were 16 head coaches for the North Stars team.

The North Stars' first head coach and general manager was Wren Blair, who coached for the first three seasons, and was the North Stars' general manager until 1974; Jack Gordon, Lou Nanne, and Bob Gainey were also the general manager of the North Stars during their tenures as head coach. Nine of the first twelve North Stars head coaches lasted less than two complete seasons, while ten of the first twelve head coaches have spent their entire NHL head coaching careers with the North Stars. Gordon was the first North Stars head coach to have coached more than two complete seasons, with four.

Several head coaches have had multiple tenures with the North Stars. Glen Sonmor served three terms as North Stars head coach. He is the North Stars' all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached, regular-season game wins, regular-season points, playoff games coached, and playoff-game wins. Sonmor's first term lasted five seasons, the longest duration for one North Stars head coach term; his last term lasted two games, which was the shortest tenure. Blair, Gordon and Charlie Burns each served two terms as the North Stars' head coach. None of their second terms were winning seasons.

Burns, Ted Harris, Parker MacDonald, Nanne, and Murray Oliver had once played for the North Stars; Burns is the only person to have been a player-coach for the North Stars, having done so in the 1969–70 season. 1980 U.S. Olympic ""Miracle on Ice"" coach Herb Brooks, who coached the North Stars in the 1987–88 season, is the only North Stars head coach to have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder; Harry Howell and Gainey were inducted as players. Sonmor and Gainey are the only head coaches to reach the Stanley Cup Finals with the North Stars, in the 1981 and 1991 Finals respectively. Gainey was the last head coach of the North Stars; he coached the franchise until the 1995–96 season.

History

In the 1910s and 1920s, railroad workers recruited from Mexico settled the area along north Broadway Street called “the North End”. The area became Wichita’s first barrio and the seat of the local Mexican American community. The portion east of Broadway became known as El Huarache; the area west of Broadway and north of 21st Street became El Pueblo. In the following decades, immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America continued to settle in the neighborhood, bolstering and broadening its Hispanic character.

In recent years, community organizations have formed to both preserve the neighborhood’s heritage and encourage economic development. The area has become well-known locally for its Latin American restaurants and marketplace.

Geography
El Pueblo is located at  (37.73083, -97.34889) at an elevation of . It consists of the area between 29th Street to the north, 21st Street to the south, the Little Arkansas River to the west, and Broadway Street to the east. It borders the BNSF/Union Pacific rail corridor to the east, the Midtown and North Riverside neighborhoods to the south, Benjamin Hills across the river to the west, and Jones Park to the north. Chisholm Creek, a tributary of the Arkansas River flows southeast through the eastern portion of the neighborhood.

Midwest Communications Inc. All the offices and studios are located at 1020 S. 25th Street in Fargo, while its 6-tower transmitter array is located northeast of Glyndon. It has the fifth biggest daytime AM signal in the country.

History
First known as KKAG, 740 AM signed on testing its signal on November 13, 2006 with open carriers and test tones. The station became fully licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 28, 2007 originally owned by Jeffrey Dress of Kennewick, Washington, and had been on the air since with a classic country format.

Although the radio industry already had speculated so, KKAG was originally planned to be operated by the late Robert Ingstad, but the project was put on the back burner when Robert Ingstad's brother, James Ingstad, purchased the Clear Channel radio station group of Fargo in January 2007.

On Monday, June 11, 2007, it was announced that Radio Fargo-Moorhead, owned by James Ingstad, planned to buy KKAG from Jeffrey Dress, and that it would broadcast the Fan Radio Network. KVOX on 1280 AM (now KVXR), former home of The Fan, is now a Catholic radio station owned by Real Presence radio. The official sale to Ingstad was approved on August 3, 2007. KKAG began simulcasting KVOX on August 14, 2007. On September 14, 2007, KKAG changed its call letters to KVOX, and the former KVOX (1280 AM) switched to KVXR.

On March 29, 2017, the station changed its call sign to the current KNFL.

2006 establishments in North DakotaThe Portrait of Giovanni de' Medici as a Child (c. 1545) is an oil on panel painting by the Florentine artist Agnolo Bronzino. It is currently located at the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.

Background
This portrait uses oil paint on panel and portrays Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici. It was painted for his father, Cosimo I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Bronzino was the official painter of the Medici Court from 1532 and did many portraits of Duke Cosimo I and his family. Cosimo had his portrait done by Bronzino around 1545, the Portrait of Cosimo I de’ Medici. Giovanni and his mother Eleonora of Toledo were the subjects of another portrait by Bronzino from around 1545 or 1546, the Portrait of Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son.

Description and Analysis
An extended title for this portrait is the Portrait of Giovanni de’ Medici as a Child holding a Goldfinch. It was painted sometime between 1544 and 1545, based on the child's age. Giovanni was born in the September 1543 and this portrait depicts him at the age of eighteen months. He is wearing a pink doublet, which is painted with high detail. He holds a goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in his hand, which is a Christian symbol, because the goldfinch eats thistle seed and so is associated with Christ’s Crown of Thorns and the Passion. It appears in religious paintings to represent the knowledge of the future Crucifixion. Around his neck, he wears a gold chain with a coral and other charms. It was believed that coral could protect children from harm.

Unlike Bronzino's other portraits that depict the sitters viewing the world with a distant, aristocratic disdain, Giovanni's portrait is animated and engaging. The portraits of Cosimo's other children are represented with the same emotionless faces as the adults. They do not show any of the children's personality and are very serious. Most of the portraits have the sitter with the body almost face-on, with a slight three-quarter turn of the head to the left. The sitter looks at the  viewer and the dark backgrounds are unspecific. Giovanni's portrait is quite different. It depicts an almost 2-year-old child cheerfully and realistically, with an accurate description of the morphology of a young child. Unlike the portraits of the duke's other sons, it is cropped above the knee and the body is presented almost frontally with a slight turn to our left. The child is seated on dark-brown bench, with a dark green background that contrasts well with his pink clothes that are the same color as his coral charm. It is a natural depiction of early childhood with his chubby face and fingers. Two of his baby teeth are peeping out, and he has tufts of fine hair that all add to his delightful representation. His active expression is that of a young child as he smiles and gazes out at the viewer. Giovanni was the fourth and youngest child of Cosimo, and was portrayed differently from his brothers because his father had different goals for his life. Years later, after Giovanni became a cardinal at the age of seventeen, he had Bronzino paint an allegorical portrait titled Portrait of Giovanni de’ Medici as St. John the Baptist, which was painted between 1560 and 1562.

It was said a month after he was born, he was “beautiful and plump” (bello e grasso) and “like an angel from paradise”. In 1547, he was described as “the handsomest and happiest boy that ever was…” which certainly fits the portrayal of his character in this charming portrait.

Biography
Annie May Hurd was born in 1893 in La Conner, Washington. She received an A.B. degree from the University of Washington in 1915 and an M.S. from that institution in 1917.  She received her Ph.D. in plant physiology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1918.  The same year that she received her doctoral degree, Hurd joined the staff of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as a researcher for the Bureau of Plant Industry.  She married physicist Sebastian Karrer in 1923.  She continued her work for USDA, specializing in the improvement of cereal crops and the control of their diseases.  Now as Annie Karrer, she rose to the position of associate plant physiologist in 1924; she was named plant physiologist in 1944, a position she held until 1949. Karrer published 16 papers in the USDA series of reports.  Her articles appeared in journals including the American Journal of Botany, Plant Physiology, The Journal of General Physiology, and Soil Science.  Three papers on the effects of selenium appeared in Science in the 1930s.

Karrer made a gift to the University of Washington that established the Sebastian Karrer Prize, in honor of her husband.  First given in 1947, it is awarded to a senior or graduate student in the department of physics on the basis of need, scholarship, and good character.

It is unusual in that it incorporates both a small forward wing and a small conventional horizontal stabilizer on the tail.

Design and development
The Catbird was designed by Burt Rutan while his company, Scaled Composites, was owned by Beechcraft. The design was intended to replace the long-produced Bonanza. The financial situation of Beech at the time, and competing projects, prevented consideration of commercial production. In 1988 Beechcraft sold Scaled Composites to the partnership of Rutan and the Wyman-Gordon Company, who also acquired the rights to a number of the designs, including Model 81 Catbird.

The aircraft was stored inverted from the ceiling of Scaled Composites' Mojave hangar until April 2011. The aircraft was restored to flying condition by Zach Reeder, Jim Reed and Mike Melvill. Catbird's second first flight was July 7, 2011.

World records
Catbird holds the world record for speed over a closed circuit of 5,000 km without payload of 334.44 km/h, set in 2014 in Category C-1c, Landplanes with take-off weights from 1000 to 1750 kg.

The aircraft won the CAFE Foundation's 1988 California CAFE 400 race flown by Mike Melvill, in which aircraft compete for performance efficiency, as measured by fuel consumption, speed and payload. Piloted by Dick Rutan, it subsequently won the 1993 CAFE Challenge with a record score and a speed of , fuel consumption of 20.15 mpg (US miles and gallons) and a payload of .

In 2014, the Catbird set another record, for speed over a closed 2,000 km course, from Mojave to EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, with an average speed of 339.50 km/h (211 mph).

Rosie SuttonOnika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (), is a Trinidadian-born rapper, singer, and songwriter. She is known for her versatility as an artist, her animated flow and lyricism in her rapping and her usage of alter egos and accents. Minaj first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009. She rose to fame with her debut album, Pink Friday (2010), which topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The fifth single, ""Super Bass"", reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and became the highest charting solo song by a female rapper since 2002. It also became the second song by a solo female rapper to become diamond certified in the US.

The follow-up album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), saw Minaj exploring a dance-pop and pop rap sound, and reached number one in several countries worldwide. Her third and fourth studio albums, The Pinkprint (2014) and Queen (2018), explored more personal topics and marked a return to her hip hop roots. The former's U.S. top-two second single, ""Anaconda"", became the first solo female rap video to reach one billion views on YouTube. Her collaboration with Karol G, ""Tusa"", became the longest running number one single in Argentina. In 2020, Minaj spawned her first and second U.S. number-one singles with ""Say So"" remix with Doja Cat and ""Trollz"" with 6ix9ine. With ""Trollz"", she became the first female rapper in two decades to debut at number one on the chart. She became the first female artist to hold one hundred Billboard Hot 100 entries. She has twenty U.S. top ten singles, the most for any female rapper, and is one of seven female artists to reach it. She re-released her mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty (2009) in 2021, becoming the highest debut for a female rap mixtape, debuting at number two in the U.S.

Often cited as the ""Queen of Rap"" and the ""Queen of Hip Hop"", she has also been named as one of the most influential rappers of all time by several media outlets. Minaj is also one of the best-selling artists of all time, with 100 million records sold worldwide. Billboard ranked her as the top female rapper of the 2010s, and seventh among the top female artists. Her accolades include eight American Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, six MTV Europe Music Awards, twelve BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, a Brit Award, and three Guinness World Records. In 2016, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Outside of music, her film career has included voice roles in the animated films Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) and The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019) as well as supporting roles in the comedy films The Other Woman (2014) and Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016). She is currently the most followed rapper on Instagram with over 175 million followers.

Early life
Onika Tanya Maraj was born in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on December 8, 1982. Her father was Robert Maraj (1956-2021), a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent. Her mother, Carol Maraj, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry. Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth. Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987. She has an older brother named Jelani, a younger brother named Micaiah, and a younger sister named Ming.

As a child, Minaj and her older brother, Jelani, grew up with her grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins. Minaj's mother, Carol Maraj, was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York City to attend Monroe College leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. Eventually, when Minaj was five, Carol got her first house on 147th Street in South Jamaica, Queens and migrated both Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father. Minaj recalled, ""I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.""  Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts. After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001.

At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from ""at least 15 jobs"" for similar reasons. Other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street. Minaj recalls buying a BMW as a 19 year old with the money from waitressing.

Career

2004−2009: Career beginnings
Minaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called The Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of ""Bowlegged Lou""), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up. In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, ""Don't Mess With"", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. Later, Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract. Originally adopting the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that ""my real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!""

Minaj released her first mixtape, Playtime Is Over, on July 5, 2007, and her second, Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008. She released her third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009; it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV. At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. One of its tracks, ""I Get Crazy"", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After Minaj was discovered by fellow rapper Lil Wayne, she signed a recording contract with his Young Money Entertainment. That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of ""5 Star Bitch"" by Yo Gotti.

In early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with her features on ""Knockout"" and ""Up Out My Face"" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively. Minaj also appeared on ""BedRock"" and ""Roger That"" on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009). The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100; their parent album reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At Jay-Z's suggestion, Robin Thicke featured Minaj on his single ""Shakin' It 4 Daddy"". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated that, during that time, she ""became the go-to girl for artists who wanted to add some skank to their tracks without sullying themselves in the process"". Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100.

2010–2011: Breakthrough with Pink Friday

On March 29, 2010, Minaj released ""Massive Attack"". Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, Pink Friday, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance and the next single, ""Your Love"", released on June 1, became the album's lead single, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Rap Songs chart. In September, Minaj released ""Check It Out"" and ""Right Thru Me"" as follow-up singles. She also became the first female rap artist to ever perform at Yankee Stadium in 2010.

In October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's ""Monster"", with her verse receiving acclaim and many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song; The Village Voices Sean Fennessey stated that ""Monster"" was the track that announced Minaj's ""brilliance"" to most people. Complex rated Minaj's ""Monster"" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years. Lauren Nostro of Complex wrote: ""Once the beat drops, we meet the many faces of Nicki Minaj. [...] Her performance has the power, years after its release, makes you stop dead in your tracks. Altering her vocal style on every line, she bounces her wordplay from Giuseppe Zanotti shoes to Tony Matterhorn's ""Dutty Wine"" to suggesting a ménage à trois with Kanye and his then-girlfriend Amber Rose. [...] It was clear, she did her thing alongside the best in the game—she stole the show, in fact, outshined them all."" In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for her guest verse on Ludacris' song ""My Chick Bad"".

Pink Friday was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies. It had the highest sales week for a female rap album this century and second highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998).Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was certified platinum in December, and eventually reached number one in the United States in February 2011. Pink Friday became the first solo album by a female rapper to go platinum in seven years.

""Moment 4 Life"" was released as the fourth single from Pink Friday shortly after the album's release. The song serves as the third single off the album, released as a single on December 7, 2010. Minaj performed ""Right Thru Me"" and ""Moment 4 Life"" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011 episode of Saturday Night Live. ""Super Bass"", the album's fifth single, was released in April 2011, and became a sleeper hit and commercial success; it ultimately peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and was eventually certified octuple-platinum in the U.S. At the time, Super Bass was the highest charting solo single by a female rapper since Missy Elliott's Work It. The music video has 900 million views on YouTube as of August 2021.

Minaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' 2011 Femme Fatale Tour. She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' ""Till the World Ends"", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a ""nip slip"" during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident. Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident attracted protest from the Parents Television Council. Despite this, Minaj continued to perform at high-profile events throughout 2011; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M, and she performed ""Super Bass"" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. In December 2011, Minaj was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Rap Album for Pink Friday. Also that year, she won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video for ""Super Bass"", marking her first VMA win.

2012–2013: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and The Re-Up

""Starships"" was released in February 2012 as the lead single from Minaj's forthcoming second album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. The song reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and went on to become the fifth best-selling single of 2012 and one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. Minaj's crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success. Follow-up singles ""Beez in the Trap"" and ""Right by My Side"" were released shortly after. Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than planned. The album was preceded by the promotional singles ""Roman in Moscow"" and ""Stupid Hoe"". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in June 2012. However, its mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews from music critics.

""Pound the Alarm"" and ""Va Va Voom"" were later released as the final singles from the album. Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform the single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"", during the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. Minaj was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering ""Roman Holiday"" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake ""Pope"" to escort her on the red carpet. The ""exorcism"" scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. Catholic League president Bill Donohue called Minaj's performance ""vulgar"".

Minaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012, which was followed by the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14, 2012. Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her single ""Starships"" as ""not real hip-hop"".

The following month, Minaj voiced Steffie in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). She won awards for Best Female Video (for ""Starships"") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards. An expanded version of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, was released on November 19, 2012. That month, Minaj was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled Nicki Minaj: My Truth. She announced plans for her own record label after signing Parker Ighile, Brinx, Keisha, and Blackout Movement. In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of American Idol with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, and Randy Jackson. Throughout the show there were disagreements between Carey and Minaj. Minaj left the series at the end of the season.

2014–2017: The Pinkprint and other ventures
Minaj's first live-action theatrical film The Other Woman was filmed in spring 2013 and premiered on April 25, 2014. She played Lydia, assistant to Carly (played by Cameron Diaz). In 2013, Minaj described her then-forthcoming third album, The Pinkprint, as ""a continuation of The Re-Up with a lot more"" and said it would focus on her ""hip-hop roots"". During an MTV interview, she said that her third album would be ""next level"" and that she has ""much to talk about"".

""Pills n Potions"" was released as the lead single from The Pinkprint in May 2014. ""Anaconda"" was released in August as the second single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting single in the U.S. to date. The music video for ""Anaconda"" attracted significant controversy from conservative media and went viral upon release online; it set a 24-hour Vevo record, accumulating 19.6 million views on its first day of release, breaking the record previously held by Miley Cyrus for ""Wrecking Ball"". In December of that year, Minaj received two Grammy Award nominations, for Best Rap Song (""Anaconda"") and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (""Bang Bang"" with Jessie J and Ariana Grande).

The Pinkprint was officially released on December 15, 2014, and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 244,000 equivalent units (198,000 in pure album sales and 46,000 combined album-equivalent units and streams). Upon release, the album received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the production and personal lyrics. At the 58th Grammy Awards, Minaj received three more Grammy Award nominations, including a second Best Rap Album nomination for The Pinkprint.

On November 9, 2014, Minaj hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Scotland. She also won the Best Hip-Hop Award for a second time. In March 2015, Minaj embarked on her third world tour entitled The Pinkprint Tour and also became the first female artist to chart four songs simultaneously in the top 10 of Billboards Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop airplay chart. At the 2015 BET Awards, Minaj won her sixth consecutive award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, becoming the female rapper with most wins in that category.

In August 2015, Madame Tussauds unveiled a wax figure of Minaj, which depicted her bent down on her hands and knees—the pose from the ""Anaconda"" music video. The attraction received criticism from some, including rapper Azealia Banks and The Independent, who called it ""sexist"" and ""racist"". Despite this, Minaj voiced her approval of the wax figure on social media. After numerous visitors began taking sexually suggestive photos with Minaj's statue, the museum instituted extra security. In September 2015, it was announced that Minaj would executive produce and appear in a scripted single-camera comedy series for ABC Family (now Freeform) based on her life growing up in Queens, New York City. The show was titled Nicki and the pilot episode was filmed in Minaj's hometown in January 2016. In October 2016, Minaj stated the filming was postponed for undisclosed reasons.

In May 2015, it was announced that Minaj would feature in the third installment of the Barbershop film series, alongside Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, and other original cast members. Titled Barbershop: The Next Cut, the film was released on April 15, 2016, and received critical acclaim, earning an average score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Minaj's character in the film is a ""sassy"" hairdresser named Draya. For her performance, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Comedy.

In February 2017, Minaj was featured on Jason Derulo's single ""Swalla"", which reached the top ten in several countries, including a peak of number six in the UK singles chart. The following month, Minaj signed with the major modeling agency, Wilhelmina Models. On March 20, 2017, when her singles ""No Frauds"", ""Changed It"", and ""Regret in Your Tears"" were released simultaneously, Minaj broke the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries for a female artist, which was previously held by Aretha Franklin. The record was later surpassed by Taylor Swift in December 2020. In May, Minaj opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a medley performance that was described by Elias Leight of Rolling Stone as ""flamboyantly produced"" and ""dexterous"".

Throughout the remainder of 2017, Minaj performed guest verses on several singles, including Migos' ""MotorSport"" and Yo Gotti's ""Rake It Up"", both of which peaked inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, at numbers six and eight, respectively. She also featured on Katy Perry's ""Swish Swish"", which peaked at 46 on the chart and was certified platinum in the US and Canada.

2018–2019: Queen

Minaj announced her fourth album, Queen, on the red carpet at the 2018 Met Gala; the album was scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018, but was delayed multiple times before being released on August 10, 2018. Its lead single, ""Chun-Li"", was released on April 12, 2018, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. She performed the song on Saturday Night Live and the 2018 BET Awards. Another single, ""Barbie Tingz"", was released alongside ""Chun-Li"", but did not make the final album cut. It is, however, included on the Target version of the album. Queens second single, ""Bed"", featuring Ariana Grande, was released on June 14, 2018, alongside the album pre-order, and peaked at number 42 on the Hot 100. On July 22, 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine's single ""Fefe"", which featured Minaj, was released and debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Fefe"" marked Minaj's highest bow on the chart as a featured artist at the time, besting the sixth place start of ""Bang Bang"" in 2014. It later peaked at number three on the Hot 100, and was added to Queen in the middle of its first tracking week.

The day before the album's release, Minaj launched her own Beats 1 radio show, Queen Radio. Queen debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 185,000 album-equivalent units, of which 78,000 came from pure album sales. It also debuted at number five in the UK and at number four in Australia, marking the highest debut of Minaj's career in the latter country. Upon debuting second on the Billboard 200, Minaj expressed frustration and criticized several people in a series of tweets, including Travis Scott, whose album Astroworld claimed the top spot for a second week in a row, blocking Queen from the top spot. Minaj claimed that Travis Scott sold shirts, merchandise, and ticket passes for an unnannounced tour to boost his album sales. Queen roll-out and the ensuing controversy was documented by several news outlets and commentators. Queen received generally positive reviews, with some critics taking issue with the album's length and consistency. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in January 2019, for moving over 1 million equivalent units.

On August 20, Minaj won her fourth MTV Video Music Award for the ""Chun-Li"" music video at the 35th annual ceremony. Later that month, BTS' single, ""Idol"", featuring Minaj, was released; it debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the group's second highest-charting song. On October 12, 2018, British girl group Little Mix released their single featuring Minaj, ""Woman Like Me"". A music video, which features Minaj wearing ""Elizabethan ruff and not much else"", was released the same month. A BBC writer opined that the video ""tackle[s] gender stereotypes"". Minaj was featured on Tyga's song ""Dip"", which reached number 63 on the Hot 100, making her the first female artist to have 100 entries on the chart. She later attended the year-end Billboard Women in Music event, receiving the Game Changer Award for the accomplishment.

Minaj also participated in a series of music festivals. On September 2, 2018, Minaj co-headlined the annual Made in America Festival and suffered a wardrobe malfunction. In November 2018, Minaj was invited to the DWP music festival in China but did not perform due to problems with the company hosting the event. In April 2019, Minaj made a guest appearance at the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival during Ariana Grande's set and performed alongside her to their collaborations ""Side to Side"" and ""Bang Bang"". However, she experienced technical difficulties with her earpiece. Later that month, Minaj parted ways with her longtime management team after a mutual agreement.

In June 2019, Minaj released her first solo song of 2019, titled ""Megatron"". In July, she provided information on her forthcoming fifth studio album, appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon stating ""You're the first to find out ... of course there's a new album.""

The following week, ""Tusa"", Minaj's collaboration with Colombian singer Karol G, was released to streaming platforms. The track peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of many other charts, including the ""Hot Latin Songs"" chart which made it the first song with two lead female artists to debut in such position.

2020–2021: Collaborations and Beam Me Up Scotty re-release
After a social media hiatus, she returned to both Twitter and Instagram on January 30, 2020, to announce her appearance as a guest judge on the premiere episode of the twelfth season on the American reality competition series RuPaul's Drag Race. The next day, her collaboration with American singer Meghan Trainor entitled ""Nice to Meet Ya"" was released accompanied by a music video. Soon after posting a snippet of a new, untitled track, Minaj announced that she would be returning to music with her first solo song of 2020, titled ""Yikes"" which was released on February 7, 2020.

On May 1, 2020, American rapper Doja Cat featured Minaj on two remixes of her song ""Say So"". That week, the remix topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj's first single to reach number one on the chart. The song became the first female collaboration in six years since ""Fancy"" by Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX (2014) to peak atop the chart, and marked the first time that a song by two female rappers reached the top, with Meaghan Garvey of Billboard remarking that it ""paved the way for Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion 'WAP' a few months after"".

On June 12, 2020, 6ix9ine and Minaj released their third collaboration, ""Trollz"", which debuted atop the Hot 100, becoming Minaj's second number-one single. This made Minaj the second female rapper to debut atop the Hot 100 chart since Lauryn Hill did so in 1998 with ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"". The song dropped to 34 in its second week, making it the first single to fall over 30 positions in its second week after debuting at number one, breaking the record for largest fall from number one in the country at the time; the record was later broken by Taylor Swift's ""Willow"" which dropped to 38 after debuting atop of the chart.

On July 30, 2020, Minaj collaborated with ASAP Ferg and MadeinTYO for the track ""Move Ya Hips"". Almost a month later, Minaj featured on Ty Dolla Sign's track, ""Expensive"" and featured in the video for it. She continued to appear as a featured artist on several songs into late 2020, and released ""What That Speed Bout!?"" with Mike Will Made It and YoungBoy Never Broke Again on November 6. Later that month, Minaj announced a six-part docuseries cataloging her life which was set to premiere on HBO Max.

On May 14, 2021, Minaj released a reissue of her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming the highest debut for a female rap mixtape on the chart. A song from the reissue, titled ""Seeing Green"" featuring fellow rappers Drake and Lil Wayne (associated with Young Money's lineage alongside Minaj) reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and appeared on the mid-year ""Best Hip Hop Songs of 2021 (So Far)"" critics list by HipHopDX. Minaj's verse on ""Fractions"" from Beam Me Up Scotty appeared on the mid-year ""Best Rap Verses of 2021 So Far"" critics list from Complex.

2022–present: Upcoming fifth studio album

On January 27, 2022, Minaj announced a new song called ""Do We Have a Problem?"" featuring American rapper Lil Baby. It was released on February 4, along with a music video that was directed by Benny Boom and featured guest appearances from actors Joseph Sikora and Cory Hardrict. Minaj's role in the video was inspired by Angelina Jolie's performance in the 2010 film Salt. The video also teased another track titled ""Bussin"" – the track, also a collaboration with Lil Baby, was officially released a week later, on February 11.

In a promotional Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe, Minaj said her fifth studio album is ""coming very soon."" She also made an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, where she revealed her plans to release the album before the summer of 2022. Additionally, she will be headlining for the Wireless Festival in London, set to take place in July 2022.

Artistry

Musical style

Minaj is known for her animated rapping style and ""unique"" flow. Her rapping is distinctive for its speed and the use of alter egos and accents, primarily British cockney. She often both sings and raps in her songs, and has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, ""[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.""

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj ""a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones."" Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: ""What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention."" Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in list of ""most unique flows from rappers over the last five years"", saying that she ""has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.""

Noted as a rap artist, she also occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop). Pink Friday marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden ""Super Bass"". Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album, Pink Friday Roman Reloaded, had a number of electro-hop and electro pop songs: ""HOV Lane"", ""Whip It"", ""Automatic"", ""Come on a Cone"", ""Young Forever"", ""Fire Burns"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Boys"" and ""Beez in the Trap""; while ""Starships"" is a eurodance song.

Her verse on Kanye West's ""Monster"" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song. West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:

It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of ""Monster"" because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on ""Dark Fantasy"" and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… 

Tara Colley of The Conversation described Minaj as a ""pre-eminent female rapper"" and that she has ""consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either"" and that ""her chameleonic ability"" matches ""some of rap's most verbose, witty, filthy and pop-friendly"" stars such as Eminem and Lil Wayne. Zoe Johnson of XXL, stated that in recent years Minaj's ""beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare in recent years"".

Alter egos
With her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that ""fantasy was my reality"" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj. In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself ""healer to her fans"" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York. She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight.

One of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is ""a demon inside her"" named Roman Zolanski (named after film director Roman Polanski with modified surname), Minaj's ""twin brother"", whose character she assumes when she is angry. Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on ""Roman's Revenge"" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos. On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: ""And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot."" Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski, who appeared on ""Roman's Revenge"" with a British accent and singing on ""Roman Holiday"" for the first time. Martha appeared in the ""Moment 4 Life"" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.

Influences

Minaj cites Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z as major influences: ""I can't even imagine my career, um, my creative spirit without Wayne. [...] I feel like I'm still intertwined with him creatively."" Minaj has called Lil Wayne her mentor and credited him with discovering her. On Foxy Brown and Jay-Z, Minaj said: ""I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time."" She said, further: ""I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life"" adding that Foxy Brown was ""the most influential female rapper"" for her. Minaj said in a T Magazine interview in 2017: ""Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown... [...] Those are the three I keep in my head when I'm writing because they've influenced me so much, [...] I feel like I'm a part of all of them.""

Jada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career. Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing ""Why I Love You So Much"" at every talent show she entered. While performing in Atlanta as part of her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Lauryn Hill is also one of Minaj's major influences, with Minaj quoting her lyrics in a high school yearbook. Minaj has also cited Madonna, Enya, Eminem, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Trina, Drake, Remy Ma, and Lil' Kim as influences.

She called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: ""[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!"" Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: ""When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.""

Public image

Billboard listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart. Minaj is also the most followed rapper on Instagram with 155 million followers. On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with 22 million followers on the app, as of 2021. She joined American Idol as a judge in 2013. BET has named Minaj as a ""gay icon."" Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's RIAA certifications. The organization later announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams, as reported by Yahoo! News.

Minaj has been called as a ""fashion icon"" by Allure, Time, XXL and has been called a ""camp style icon"" by Refinery29. She has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers. The Huffington Post described her style as ""risk-taking"" and ""far-out"", with ""bold sartorial choices""; Minaj has been included on the annual Maxim Hot 100 list several times. In 2014, Minaj underwent a reinvention in her image sporting a ""natural"" and ""softer"" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes. She stated that she ""went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, ""Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more"""".

Her physique, notably her buttocks, has attracted significant attention from the media. Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women. In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the ""female rappers of [her] day"", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she ""[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.""

Minaj talked about feminism in an interview with Vogue in 2015, saying ""There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to."" In 2018, an interview with Elle, in which she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, attracted criticism. In The New York Times Magazine, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj ""has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind.""

The cover art and music video for her 2014 single, ""Anaconda"", attracted significant media attention upon release. The music video was viewed 19.6 million times in its first 24 hours of release. The Guardian called the video ""racy"" but noted that she ""doesn't shy from ruffling her audience's feathers"", while others praised Minaj for ""owning her sexuality"", examining her work through a feminist perspective. Another writer for The Guardian said, of the ""Anaconda"" video, Minaj turns ""the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance.""

Philanthropy

In 2010, Minaj performed a cover of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", alongside singer Katy Perry, for service members during the 2010 VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert. The two would later collaborate in 2017 on ""Swish Swish"". In 2011, Mattel created a Barbie doll with Minaj's likeness to auction for Project Angel Food, a charity that provides food for people afflicted with HIV and AIDS. In 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Minaj donated $15,000 to the Food Bank For New York City and held a turkey drive at her alma mater, PS 45.

In May 2017, Minaj offered via Twitter to pay college tuition fees and student loans for 30 of her fans. She appeared to grant their requests, ranging from $500 to school supplies to $6,000 for tuition, promising to respond to more requests in a month or two. She also announced that she would launch an official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future. In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to a village in India for a few years via her pastor, Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program, and two water wells. ""This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud"", she said about the new additions to the village.

In August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was ""praying for everyone there"". On September 4, 2018, Minaj appeared as a guest and performed several songs on The Ellen Degeneres Show. Throughout the episode, Minaj and Degeneres, with the participation of Walmart, gave out over $150,000 in donations to fans. In 2019, Minaj pulled out of headlining a concert in Saudi Arabia following online backlash from activists, after women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, was detained and arrested for speaking out against the Saudi regime. Minaj was praised by Thor Halvorssen of The Human Rights Foundation, who criticized her initial plan to perform in a letter, and released a statement saying, ""After careful reflection [...] I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.""

In 2020, Minaj donated $25,000 to the ""St. Jude's Home for Girls"" school after visiting the school in her native country of Trinidad. In a speech, Minaj encouraged the girls to push through hard obstacles, even referencing her own experience with domestic violence: ""I've experienced being in a home with domestic violence. I've experienced, you know, being at a very difficult crossroads in my life as a teenager. And sometimes as a teenager when things happen, you feel like there's no up from there."" In the same year, following the release of Minaj and 6ix9ine's collaboration, ""Trollz"", Minaj announced that a portion of the proceeds from the song, along with profits from all merchandise, will go towards the Bail Project amid the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.

Legacy
Various media outlets, such as Billboard, Time, NME, NBC News, Cosmopolitan and GQ have referred to Minaj as the ""Queen of Rap"" and The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, and LA Times have referred to her as the ""Queen of Hip Hop"".

In 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj ""the most influential female rapper of all time"", and in 2015 Vanessa Grigoriadis from its magazine called her ""the world's biggest female rap superstar"". In Evening Standard, Jochan Embley called her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, saying that ""Everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics, which stare gender and race dead in the eye."" Zoe Johnson from XXL called her ""one of the most versatile MCs"" and that she has ""made millions off upbeat pop hits and traditional hip-hop sounds that cater to both her femininity and her assertive side"".

For NPR Music, Sowmya Krishnamurthy noted that Minaj has portrayed ""the quirky, life-size Barbie, glamorous vixen and girl-next-door"", arguing that she ""changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade"" with said alter egos. In 2017, Patrik Sandberg of Dazed argued that Minaj has ""surpassed every other female hip hop artist to become the most successful in history"" in 2017. In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the ""best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years — no gender preposition required."" Glamour included Minaj in their list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture.

In XXL, Madeline Roth commented that Minaj ""has helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style"". She has influenced several artists, including Tinashe, Cher Lloyd, Cupcakke, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Ms Banks, Asian Doll, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Latto, Shenseea, BIA, Lakeyah, Luísa Sonza, Coi Leray, Maliibu Miitch,  City Girls, Yung Baby Tate, Rico Nasty, Princess Vitarah, Erica Banks, Flo Milli, Ivorian Doll, Angel Haze, Rubi Rose, Lady Leshurr, and Saweetie. Billboard credited her for bringing female rap back to the mainstream in the US. With over 140 features, the magazine has called Minaj a ""rap and pop icon"" adding that ""she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles."" Minaj has been credited by Complex for being able to ""take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it."" In 2012, Caramanica in The New York Times said that:Minaj ""became a nimble, evocative rapper. She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations [...] with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark.""

In 2014, NPRs Erik Nielson said that Minaj's ""success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists"". Nylon writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which ""stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium"", also going on to say that Minaj ""battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound"" thus impacting her career. Complex also commented that, ""From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely... [she] doesn't need anything but her art to speak for itself"". Complex named her ""Best Rapper Alive"" in 2014, making her the only female being named so.

Other activities

Fragrances
Minaj has a line of fragrances first launched in September 2012. She partnered with 'Give Back Brands' to introduce her first fragrance, ""Pink Friday"", which was nominated for three 2013 FiFi Awards for Fragrance of the Year, Best Packaging, and Media Campaign of the Year. A ""Pink Friday: Special Edition"" was released in April 2013 and a deluxe edition version of the fragrance, titled ""Pink Friday: Deluxe Edition"", was also launched in December 2013. Her fourth and fifth fragrance line, ""Minajesty"", was launched in September 2013 followed by a flanker fragrance, ""Minajesty: Exotic Edition"", which was released exclusively to the Home Shopping Network in June 2014. This was followed by the launch of her sixth fragrance line, ""Onika"", in September 2014. A year later in 2015, Minaj release ""The Pinkprint"", her seventh fragrance in support of her third studio album of the same name. In 2016, Minaj launched her eighth fragrance ""Trini Girl."" In 2018, in support of her fourth studio album, she released her ninth fragrance, ""Queen.""

Products and endorsements
Minaj has been affiliated with several manufacturing companies and has endorsed a number of products during her career. She has also stated that she has learned the ins and outs of business so she could do it herself. Her first collaboration was a November 2010 endorsement deal with MAC Cosmetics which sold a lipstick, ""Pink 4 Friday"", for four consecutive Fridays to promote her album Pink Friday. In 2011, Minaj helped introduce the Casio TRYX in Times Square, and created a six-piece nail polish collection for OPI Products with colors named after her songs. In April 2012, Minaj helped launch the Nokia Lumia 900 in Times Square. The following month, Minaj appeared in television and internet advertisements for Pepsi's ""LiveForNow"" campaign, which featured a remix of her single ""Moment 4 Life"". She endorsed the 2012 Viva Glam campaign with Ricky Martin, which raised $270 million for the Mac AIDS Fund. With designer Jeremy Scott, Minaj signed an endorsement deal with Adidas' fall and winter 2012 campaign to appear in internet advertisements and commercials for Adidas Originals. Set to her song, ""Masquerade"", her segment of the advertisement was filmed in Brooklyn and also featured Big Sean, Derrick Rose, Sky Ferreira and 2NE1 in other locations worldwide.

In 2011, Mattel crafted a Barbie doll with Minaj's likeness for charity, which Minaj described as a ""major moment"" in her career. A spokeswoman for Mattel stated that, ""Barbie is obviously a pop culture icon [...] and Nicki is a big part of pop culture and also huge within the fashion industry, as well as a big Barbie fan."" Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone stated that the ""Minaj Barbie doll is notable in that the rapper has made Barbie dolls a crucial part of her aesthetic.""

In early 2013, Minaj fronted the Viva Glam campaign by herself, which included the introduction of ""Nicki 2 lipstick and lip gloss"". She also introduced the ""Nicki Minaj Collection"" clothing line for Kmart, composed of clothing, accessories and housewares. In February 2013, Bluewater Comics announced that Minaj would star in the Fame biographical-comic series, debuting in Fame: Nicki Minaj. She partnered with Beats Electronics to introduce her ""Pink Pill"" speakers in April 2013, appearing with DeRay Davis in a commercial for the speakers that same month. In June 2013, Minaj lead an ad campaign for Myx Fusions, a fruit-infused, single serve moscato wine beverage of which she is a part owner. On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Minaj was a co-owner of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. In addition to Minaj and company owner Jay Z, sixteen stakeholders including Beyoncé, Madonna, Rihanna, and Kanye West own a 3% equity stake in the service.

In 2017, she starred in H&M's holiday campaign along with Anna Ewers, Mariacarla Boscono, Jesse Williams, Charlee Fraser, and Elibeidy Dani. In 2018, Minaj starred in the trailer for Madden NFL 19 alongside Lil Dicky, Quavo and others. In 2019, Minaj began a partnership with the luxury clothing company Fendi who stated that the collaboration ""made sense ... she will present it extremely well."" Minaj's ""Fendi Prints On"" collection launched in 2019 on October 14.

COVID-19 vaccine controversy
In September 2021, Minaj announced she would not be attending the 2021 Met Gala due to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. She stated that she has avoided public appearances and traveling after contracting the virus herself and having to quarantine from her son as a result. Minaj shared several tweets about her unvaccinated status and claimed she wanted to do more research and be comfortable with her decision first. She alleged in a Tweet that her cousin's friend in Trinidad suffered swollen testicles and became impotent as a result of the vaccine. These tweets received backlash where her story about her cousin's friend became the subject of jokes and memes. Trinidad and Tobago health minister Terrence Deyalsingh declared that Minaj's claims were false and that no such report existed.

Shortly after, Minaj recommended other people get the vaccine and set up a Twitter poll on COVID-19 vaccine brands. She tweeted that she was sure she would get vaccinated herself because of touring. The White House offered Minaj a phone call with a doctor to answer questions about the safety of the vaccine. In an Instagram Live response two days later, she claimed that she was ""simply asking questions"" and she did not ""give any facts"" about the vaccine. Reporters allegedly harassed Minaj's family for a story, with Minaj sharing some text messages she alleged were harassment on social media.

Personal life
In her song ""All Things Go"", Minaj revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager. She has said that although it has ""haunted"" her, she stands by her decision. In July 2011, her cousin Nicholas Telemaque was murdered near his home in Brooklyn, an incident she references in her songs ""All Things Go"" and ""Champion"". In February 2021, Minaj's father, Robert Maraj, died while walking along a road on Long Island in a hit-and-run accident. Charles Polevich, a 70-year-old man, was charged with killing Maraj. He was arraigned and charged with two felonies: leaving scene of incident involving death of a person and tampering with or suppressing physical evidence. Minaj commented on her father's death in a letter, saying, ""[..] it has been the most devastating loss of my life. I find myself wanting to call him all the time, more so now that he's gone. [...] May his soul rest in paradise. He was very loved & will be very missed.""

Early in her career, Minaj identified as bisexual and made several references to it in her music. However, she eventually stated in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview, ""I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls."" She once again addressed her sexuality in 2020 on Doja Cat's ""Say So"" remix, ""Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero."" The lyric received backlash and divided members of the LGBT community, with some accusing her of ""bisexual erasure"" while others voicing ""there is nothing wrong with originally identifying as bisexual, and then later identifying as straight.""

In late 2014, Minaj separated from her longtime boyfriend Safaree Samuels, whom she had dated since 2003. According to Minaj, he had proposed to her, but she declined. Several tracks on The Pinkprint are believed to have been inspired by the end of their relationship. Minaj began dating rapper Meek Mill in early 2015. In January 2017, she announced that she had ended their relationship. She briefly dated fellow rapper Nas in the year 2017.

In December 2018, Minaj began dating her childhood friend Kenneth ""Zoo"" Petty and filed for a marriage license in August 2019. She announced that they had officially married on October 21. She hyphenated his last name to hers upon marriage. In July 2020, Minaj announced via Instagram that she was expecting her first child with Petty. On September 30, 2020, she gave birth to a son. Minaj refers to him as ""Papa Bear"" in public.

Legal issues 
After facing charges for failing to register as a sex offender in California, her husband Kenneth Petty was entered into the California Megan's Law database in 2020, having been convicted of attempted rape in 1995 in New York. He previously served nearly four years in prison for the mentioned crime. In August 2021, her husband's victim, named Jennifer Hough, filed a lawsuit against the couple for alleged harassment and intimidation, and alleged infliction of emotional distress, and did an interview about the mentioned lawsuit on the talk show The Real.

While Minaj has not publicly commented on the case, she addressed the accusations in a December case filing. Minaj claimed: ""I never asked [Hough] to change her story; I never offered her any money in return for a statement, and I did not threaten her with any type of harm if she chose not to provide a statement. [...] I emphatically told her that I did not want her to lie about anything and to tell the truth about what she had just revealed to me only if she was comfortable with doing so."" Hough later voluntarily dropped the case against Minaj. Speaking to a federal judge, Hough's lawyers expressed that they were going to refile the lawsuit in California, while Maraj's lawyer said that the refiling was a ""friviolous gambit to avoid a sanctions motion which I told them I would be filing shortly.""

fr:La chaleur du seinThe Sherman Firefly was a tank used by the United Kingdom and some other Allied armoured formations in the Second World War. It was based on the US M4 Sherman, but was fitted with the more powerful 3-inch (76.2 mm) calibre British 17-pounder anti-tank gun as its main weapon. Originally conceived as a stopgap until future British tank designs came into service, the Sherman Firefly became the most common vehicle mounting the 17-pounder in the war.

During the war, the British Army made extensive use of Sherman tanks. Though they expected to have their own tank models developed soon, the previously rejected idea of mounting the 17-pounder in the Sherman was eventually accepted, despite initial government resistance. This proved fortunate, as both the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger and Cruiser Mk VIII Cromwell tank designs experienced difficulties and delays.

After the difficult problem of getting such a large gun to fit in the Sherman's turret was solved, the Firefly was put into production in early 1944, in time to equip Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the Normandy landings. It soon became highly valued, as its gun could almost always penetrate the armour of the Panther and Tiger tanks it faced in Normandy, something no other British Army tank could reliably do at that time. In recognition of this, German tank and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to attack Fireflies first. Because the Firefly had a visibly longer barrel, crews tried to camouflage it so the tank would look like a normal 75 mm-gun Sherman from a distance. Between 2,100 and 2,200 were manufactured before production wound down in 1945.

Origins 
The idea of fitting a 17-pounder gun into a Sherman tank had initially been rejected by the Ministry of Supply's Tank Decision Board. Although the British Army had made extensive use of the American-built Sherman tank, it was intended that a new generation of British tanks would replace it in the anti-tank role. First, there was the Cromwell tank, which was expected to use the Vickers high velocity 75 mm gun; this gun would have had superior anti-tank performance to the US 75 mm and 76 mm guns that were mounted in the Sherman. The second was the A30 Challenger, which was based on the Cromwell but with the even more powerful 17-pounder gun. These two tanks—and their successors, the Comet and the Centurion, which were already on the drawing board—were to replace the Sherman in British service, and so the prospect of diverting resources to mount the 17-pounder on the Sherman seemed undesirable.

Nonetheless, several unofficial attempts were made to improve the firepower of the Sherman. The earliest can be credited to Major George Brighty of the Royal Tank Regiment while he was at Lulworth Armoured Fighting School in early 1943. Despite the A30 Challenger undergoing initial trials at Lulworth, Brighty was convinced that the Sherman was a better mount for the 17-pounder. However, the turret of the Sherman was too small to allow for the very long recoil of the gun. In a radical adjustment, Brighty removed the recoil system and locked the gun in place, thus making the entire tank absorb the recoil, but this was a far from ideal situation and there was no telling how long the tank would have been able to handle such a set-up.

Around June 1943, a colleague of Brighty, Lieutenant Colonel George Witheridge of the Royal Tank Regiment, arrived at Lulworth. A veteran of the North Africa campaign, Witheridge had experienced first-hand the one-sided battles between British tanks armed with 2-pounder guns against Rommel's formidable tanks and anti-tank guns. During the Battle of Gazala in mid-1942, Witheridge had been blown out of his (US supplied) M3 Grant medium tank, and though he recovered from his wounds, he was declared unfit to return to combat duty. In January 1943, he was posted to Fort Knox in the United States for six months to advise on gunnery, where he was ""sold"" on the Sherman tanks. While at Lulworth, Witheridge inspected the A30 Challenger, and ""joined in the chorus of complaints"" about the tank. Upon looking up Brighty and learning of his attempts to use the Sherman, Witheridge lent his assistance. He advised Brighty on methods to solve the recoil issue.

Not long after, Witheridge and Brighty received a notice from the Department of Tank Design (DTD) to cease their efforts. Unwilling to abandon the project, Witheridge, using his connections with such influential people as Major General Raymond Briggs, former General Officer Commanding the 1st Armoured Division in North Africa and now director of the Royal Armoured Corps, and successfully lobbied Claude Gibb, Director-General of Weapons and Instruments Production at the Ministry of Supply, to make it an official ministry project. In doing so, the endeavour was taken out of the hands of the highly enthusiastic and devoted amateurs at Lulworth who had initiated it and given to professional tank developers.

Design 

W. G. K. Kilbourn, a Vickers engineer working for the DTD, transformed their idea into the reality of the prototype of the tank that would serve the British forces from the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The first thing Kilbourn had to fix was the lack of a workable recoil system for the 17-pounder. The 17-pounder travelled  back as it absorbed the recoil of the blast. This was too long for the Sherman's turret. Kilbourn solved this problem by redesigning the recoil system completely rather than modifying it. The recoil cylinders were shortened and placed on both sides of the gun to take advantage of the width of the turret.

The gun breech itself was also rotated 90 degrees to allow loading from the left rather than from on top. The radio, normally mounted in the back of the turret in British tanks, had to be moved; an armoured box (a ""bustle"") was attached to the back of the turret to house it, with access through a large hole cut through the turret.

The next problem encountered by Kilbourn was that the gun cradle, the metal block on which the gun sat, had to be shortened to allow the gun to fit into the Firefly and thus the gun itself was not very stable. Kilbourn had a new barrel designed for the 17-pounder that had a longer un-tapered section at the base, which helped solve the stability problem. A new mantlet was designed to house this gun and the modified cradle. The Firefly had no armour or mobility advantages over the normal Sherman tank beyond the additional 13 mm of protection added to its mantlet. The modifications were extensive enough that 17-pounders intended for the Firefly had to be factory-built specifically for it.

Kilbourn had to deal with other problems. On the standard Sherman tank, there was a single hatch in the turret through which the commander, gunner and loader entered and left the tank. The 17-pounder's larger breech and recoil system made it significantly more difficult for the loader to exit quickly; a new hatch was cut into the top of the turret over the gunner's position to resolve this. The final major change was the elimination of the hull gunner in favour of space for more 17-pounder ammunition, which was longer than the original 75 mm.

By October and November 1943, enthusiasm began to grow for the project. The 21st Army Group was informed of the new tank in October 1943. Even before final testing had taken place in February 1944, an order for 2,100 Sherman tanks armed with 17-pounder guns was placed, as the Challenger programme was suffering constant delays and it was realised that few would be ready for Normandy. Even worse, it was discovered that the Cromwell did not have a turret ring wide enough to take the new High Velocity 75mm gun (50 calibres long), so it would have to be armed with the general purpose Ordnance QF 75 mm. This left the Firefly as the only tank available with firepower superior to the QF 75 mm gun in the British arsenal, earning it the ""highest priority"" from Winston Churchill.

Name
The nickname ""Firefly"" was adopted due to the bright muzzle flash of the main gun. It was sometimes used at unit level (brigade/regiment) war diaries from March 1944, along with ""Mayfly"". During the war, Shermans with 17-pounder guns were usually known as ""1C"", ""1C Hybrid"", or ""VC"", depending on the basic mark of the vehicle. In British nomenclature, a ""C"" at the end of the Roman numeral indicated a tank equipped with the 17-pounder.

The name ""Firefly"" in period sources often refers to any vehicle with a 17-pounder gun, often the 17pdr SP Achilles M10C variant of the M10 tank destroyer.

Armament 

The main armament of the Sherman Firefly was the Ordnance Quick-Firing 17-pounder. Designed as the successor to the British QF 6-pounder, the 17-pounder was the most powerful British tank gun of the war, and one of the most powerful of any nationality, being able to penetrate more armour than the 8.8 cm KwK 36 fitted to the German Tiger I.The Firefly 17-pounder was theoretically able to penetrate some  of armour at  and  at  using standard armour piercing, capped, ballistic capped (APCBC) ammunition. Armour piercing, discarding sabot (APDS) ammunition could penetrate some 256 mm of armour at 500 m and 233 mm at 1,000 m, which on paper could defeat the armour of almost every German armoured fighting vehicle at any likely range. However, war production APDS rounds lacked accuracy, and the 50 mm penetrator was less destructive after it had penetrated enemy tank armour than the 76.2 mm APCBC shell. APDS ammunition was rare until the post-war period. While the Sherman Firefly was capable of carrying 77 rounds of ammunition, design features of the tank meant only 23 rounds were easily and readily available when the tank was in action.

Though the 17-pounder had superior anti-tank capabilities, it lacked an effective HE round and was thus inferior to the standard Sherman 75mm gun against soft targets, such as infantry, buildings and lightly armoured vehicles. As the war in Europe neared its close, the Allies found themselves encountering these more often than heavy German tanks. Allied tank units therefore typically refused to completely switch to Fireflies. A good HE shell for the gun only became available in late 1944, and even then was not as potent as the standard Sherman 75 mm HE shell.

Another problem was that the powerful blast from the 17-pounder gun kicked up large amounts of dirt as well as smoke, making it difficult for the gunner to observe the fall of shot (and forcing him to rely on the commander to observe it and to order corrections) and revealing the position of the tank (forcing the Firefly to move every few shots). Furthermore, the recoil and muzzle blast could be severely jarring to Firefly crews, and the muzzle blast frequently caused night blindness. The latter was a problem common to any tank armed with a high velocity gun, including the Panther and Tiger I. The cramped turret meant that loading the large shell was difficult, so the Firefly had a slower rate of fire than a standard M4 Sherman. Since the Firefly was a stopgap, these problems were never eliminated, as it was supposed to be retired with the introduction of the new British tank designs such as the Comet and later Centurion.

The Firefly's secondary armament was the standard 0.3 inch (7.62 mm) Browning M1919 machine gun coaxial in the turret, the hull-mounted machine gun being removed to increase ammunition storage for the main gun. A .50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 Browning heavy machine gun was also fitted on the turret roof, though many crews removed it, due to its awkward mounting and position near the commander, which limited a full 360-degree view when the hatch was open.

In 1945, some British Fireflies were fitted with a rail on either side of the turret for two ""60 lb"" high-explosive 3-inch rockets. Called ""Sherman Tulips"", these were used at the Rhine Crossing by the 1st Coldstream Guards. The rockets, accurate when fired from aircraft, were less accurate when fired from a stationary platform, such as a tank, as they had little initial slipstream over the fins. The RP-3 was only effective when its 60-pound warhead hit the target.

Production and distribution 

Three different variants of Sherman Firefly served during the Second World War, each based on a different variant of the M4 Sherman. The Firefly conversion was carried out on Sherman I (M4), Sherman I Hybrid (M4 Composite) and Sherman V (M4A4) tanks. Some sources state that several Sherman IIs (M4A1) were converted and used in action, but photos allegedly showing these conversions are in fact views of the front half of Sherman I Hybrid Fireflies. To complicate matters, a very small number of Canadian licence-built Sherman IIs (M4A1), the Grizzly, were converted to Fireflies in Canada and used for training, but none saw action. The majority of Shermans converted were the Sherman V/M4A4 model, of which the British received about 7,200. The Sherman VC and IC variants are easily distinguished by their lower hulls; the VC having a lengthened hull, and a larger gaps between the suspension units. They employed the three-piece bolted transmission housing. The Sherman IC usually sported the cast transmission housing. The Hybrid can be distinguished by its upper hull, which is cast and gives it a distinctive curved look in comparison to the more boxy hull of a typical Sherman.

Production of the Firefly started in January 1944 and, by 31 May, some 342 Sherman Fireflies had been delivered to the 21st Army Group for the D-Day landings. As a result, British tank troops were composed of three standard Shermans and one Firefly. The same distribution occurred in Cromwell units, but this caused logistical problems, as each Cromwell troop then needed to be supplied with parts for two different tanks. The Firefly was also slower than the Cromwell. Churchill units received no Fireflies, and as a result often had to rely on any attached M10 or M10 Achilles units to provide increased firepower to deal with tanks their own guns could not eliminate.

Production was limited by the availability of suitable tanks, with the phasing out of 75 mm Sherman production. To make up numbers, Sherman I and Sherman I Hybrids were also converted. From D-Day in June to the end of the Battle of Normandy in late August, almost 400 Sherman Fireflies were converted, more than sufficient to replace any permanent tank losses during the battle. In late 1944, with the creation of an effective high-explosive shell for the 17-pounder gun, British units started to receive two Fireflies per troop. By February 1945, some 2,000 Sherman Fireflies had been built and British, Commonwealth and Polish armoured units were equipped with a 50/50 mix of 75 mm and 17-pounder-armed Shermans.

In the spring of 1945, production of the Firefly was scaled down, with the last tank being delivered in May 1945. This was the result of several factors, from superior home-grown designs like the Comet and Centurion coming into service to replace the Firefly, to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany, and the inferior design of Japan's tanks, which it seemed would be the next opponents the British would have to face after the fall of Germany.

Production of the Sherman Firefly reached some 2,100 – 2,200 tanks; exact numbers are hard to determine as documents give contradictory totals. Jane's World War II Tanks and Fighting Vehicles gives a production of 1,783 vehicles in 1944 and 563 in 1945, for a total of 2,346. Sherman Firefly gives a number of 2,002 conversions made between January 1944 and February 1945 or a total of 2,139 conversions.

Service

Normandy 

Fireflies were introduced to armoured brigades and divisions in the 21st Army Group in 1944, just in time for the Normandy landings. The timing was fortunate as Allied intelligence had begun to realise in early 1944 through statistical analysis that the Germans were fielding a much larger number of more formidable tanks (such as the Panther) than had been anticipated. This information was slow to reach Allied military planners, who had mistakenly assumed the Panther, like the Tiger, would be a rare heavy tank with a limited production run, so the number of Panthers deployed came as a surprise to Allied formation commanders and tank crews forced to engage them with guns that could not penetrate the frontal armour except at short range.

Ken Tout, who served as a tank gunner and tank commander in the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry in Normandy in 1944, described the effect of mounting a 17-pounder in the Sherman:

Panthers and Tigers accounted for only about 126 of the 2,300 German tanks deployed in Normandy; the rest being Panzer IVs, Sturmgeschütz III tank destroyers and other armoured vehicles that the 75 mm Shermans could penetrate. The importance of Caen and Montgomery's operations, which pinned German armoured forces in front of the British positions so the American units could break out to the west, meant that British and other  Commonwealth units had to face over 70 per cent of the German armour deployed during the Battle of Normandy, as well as over half of the elite, well-equipped Waffen-SS Panzer units. As a result, the Sherman Firefly was perhaps the most valued tank by British and other Commonwealth commanders, as it was the only tank in the British Army able to reliably penetrate the frontal armour of Panthers and Tigers at the standard combat ranges in Normandy.

This fact did not go unnoticed by the Germans, who realised that these long-barrel Shermans posed a much greater threat to their heavy tanks than the normal Shermans, and German tank crews and anti-tank gun crews were instructed to eliminate Fireflies first. Similarly, the Firefly crews realised that the distinctive long barrel of their 17-pounder gun made their Fireflies stand out from standard Shermans, so they attempted to disguise their tanks to reduce the likelihood of being targeted. Some crews had the front half of the olive drab gun barrel painted white on the bottom, or white with dark green on top, to give the illusion of a shorter gun barrel. Another suggestion was for a shorter wooden dummy gun to be mounted on the rear of the turret and point forward; however, this tactic does not appear to have been used in combat.

Despite being a high priority target, Fireflies appear to have had a statistically lower chance of being knocked out than standard Shermans, probably due more to how they were employed than to the effectiveness of the camouflaging of the long barrel. Given the high value placed on Fireflies, a common tactic was for commanders to reconnoitre the battlefield before a battle, to look for good overwatch positions. During the battle, Fireflies would stay behind in those positions and cover the ordinary Shermans as they pushed forward, eliminating any enemy tanks that revealed themselves when they opened fire on the advancing Shermans, and moving forward only when the standard Shermans had secured the area or when the Fireflies could no longer cover them. Similarly, when on the move, troop commanders tended to position Fireflies in the rear to reduce the chance of their being knocked out. Given the relatively unpredictable nature of battle, this was not always possible and many times, Fireflies were forced to engage enemies in the open, where they could be identified.

Despite this, the Firefly's increased firepower was much valued, and during many engagements, the Firefly proved its worth, knocking out Tigers and Panthers at long range, as well as less formidable tanks such as Panzer IVs and StuG tank destroyers.

Norrey-en-Bessin
One example of this increased firepower was displayed by Lt. G. K. Henry's Firefly during the defence of Norrey-en-Bessin on 9 June against an attack by the 3rd Company of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment of the 12th SS Panzer Division. Determined to capture the village in preparation for a larger offensive to drive the British and Canadians back into the sea, Kurt Meyer ordered 12 Panthers of the 3rd Company and infantry to attack Norrey and drive out the Canadians. The attack got under way at 1300 hours, with the Panthers racing towards the town at full speed, stopping only to fire their guns. They quickly outran their infantry support, which was forced to ground by Allied artillery fire. Within  of the village, nine standard Shermans of the Canadian 1st Hussars opened fire into the advancing Panthers' flanks. Lt. Henry's gunner, Trooper A. Chapman, waited until the Panthers ""lined up like ducks in a row"" and quickly knocked out five Panthers with just six rounds. The attack was repulsed with the loss of seven of the 12 Panthers.

Tilly-sur-Seulles

A similar event occurred on 14 June, during Operation Perch. Sgt. Harris of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, along with three standard Shermans, set up defensive positions along with the infantry after capturing the village of Lingèvres, near Tilly-sur-Seulles, France. Looking through his binoculars, Sgt. Harris spotted two Panthers advancing from the east. He opened fire at a range of , knocking out the lead Panther with his first shot, and the other with his second. Relocating to a well-concealed flanking position on the other side of the town, he spotted another three Panthers approaching from the west. He and his gunner, Trooper Mackillop, knocked them out with three rounds.

Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil
In perhaps their most famous action, British and Canadian Fireflies defeated the heavy armour of a German counterattack at Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil during Operation Totalize on 8 August 1944, resulting in the destruction of five Tiger tanks and the death of the attack's leader, the noted German tank commander Michael Wittmann. The battle involved Fireflies from A Squadron, 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, 33rd Armoured Brigade; A Squadron, the Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and B Squadron, The 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, 33rd Armoured Brigade. They ambushed a group of seven Tiger tanks from the 3rd Company and HQ Company, 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion supported by Panzer IV tanks and StuG IV assault guns. The tanks of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry reached the French village of Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil on the morning of 8 August 1944. While B Squadron stayed around the village, A and C Squadrons moved further south into a wood called Delle de la Roque.

C Squadron positioned themselves on the east side of the woods and the under-strength A Squadron in the southern portion with No. 3 Troop on the western edge of the wood. From this position, they overlooked a large open section of ground and were able to watch as German tanks advanced up Route Nationale 158 from the village of Cintheaux. They held their fire until the German tanks were well within range. Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon's Sherman Firefly (Velikye Luki – A Squadron's tanks were named after towns in the Soviet Union) - had yet to fire his gun in action. With the Tigers in range a 12-minute exchange of fire commenced that saw Ekins destroy all three Tigers that No. 3 Troop could see. A short time later, the main German counterattack was made in the direction of C Squadron. A Squadron (less Sgt Gordon who had been wounded and had already bailed out of the Firefly) moved over to support them and Ekins destroyed a Panzer IV before his tank was hit and the crew were forced to bail out.

Italy 
Although the Normandy campaign had priority, Fireflies also served with distinction in British, Commonwealth and Polish units in the Italian campaign. British units in Italy also used the Sherman with the US 76 mm gun M1.

Post-war use

Argentina 

In 1947, the Argentine Army purchased surplus armament that was stored in Belgium, including some 200 Sherman Fireflies of all sub-types; they were in use from 1948. Starting in 1959, 150 Fireflies Mk.V had their original Chrysler A-57 engine substituted for a Ford GAA V8, to improve reliability; these remained in service until the mid-1970s.  Due to increase in regional conflicts, the Fireflies were up-graded to the ""Sherman Repotenciado"" standard, which included a new gun (derived from the French CN-105-57) and a new engine (the French diesel Poyaud 520/V8-S2); the first units were incorporated in January 1978.

Paraguay 
In 1971, the Argentine Army transferred to the Paraguayan Army 3 upgraded Fireflies; these were exchanged in 1988 for 3 ""Sherman Repotenciados"" recently decommissioned.

Expansion
In January 2010, Fortis Properties, a subsidiary of Fortis Inc., announced plans to retrofit its existing building and construct a new 15-storey building next to it. The plan also called for 382 new parking spaces, an outdoor plaza and a pedestrian walk-way over Water Street to the TD Building, all at a cost of $75 million. The construction of the new building would have involved removing four of the company's existing buildings at 151 to 163 Water Street and Harbour Drive as well as amendments to the St. John's Municipal Plan to allow a building of this height in the downtown.

The proposal was slammed by members of city council, heritage advocates and by the public. After two months of controversy surrounding the proposal, Fortis Properties decided to withdraw their application before it had gone to council to be discussed, stating that they felt they did not have the support of council. The withdrawal of the proposal was also controversial and there were complaints that the city was not business friendly and that the four story height limits in downtown were unreasonable.

In 2011, the city council approves a new development proposed by Fortis to construct a 12 story building at a new location on the west end of Water Street. The company still plans to retrofit their current building to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification standards.

51,21,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type5,"The Dharamshala International Film Festival (DIFF) is an international film festival held annually in the Himalayan town McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala in India — home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan community in exile since 2012. The 10th edition will be held online from 4 to 10 November 2021.

History 
The festival was founded by filmmakers Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam in 2012 to promote contemporary cinema, art and independent media practices in the Himalayan region. DIFF also aims to encourage local filmmaking talent and create a meaningful platform to engage with the area's diverse communities.

The DIFF Film Fellows Programme was established in 2014 to give opportunities to up-and-coming filmmakers from the Himalayan region to receive mentorship sessions from filmmakers such as Gurvinder Singh, Anupama Srinivasan, Umesh Kulkarni, Kesang Tseten and Hansal Mehta.

Since 2016 DIFF has partnered with Kangra-based organisations to organise community screenings in villages, schools, colleges and the District Jail. A Film Appreciation Competition introduced to students in the area the concept of actively and critically engaging with cinema.

In 2019, the festival opened up to film submissions for the first time.

DIFF announced its inaugural Advisory Board in September 2020. The board of advisors include Adil Hussain, Arun Sarin, Asif Kapadia, Guneet Monga, and Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza.

Programme & Format 

Dharamshala International Film Festival typically screens 26 contemporary features — narratives and documentaries and short, animation and experimental films over 3 days in early November. Since 2019 the festival has accepted film submissions from India and around the world. The festival is well known for its intimate and warm atmosphere where filmmakers and attendees can converse freely. DIFF features many Indian premieres of international films and does not have a competition section. DIFF's shorts programme has been curated by Umesh Kulkarni. Since 2014, the festival has introduced a children's programme curated by Monica Wahi.The festival also features a range of Talks, Panels and Masterclasses by attending filmmakers and industry professionals. They have included Kazuhiro Soda, Asif Kapadia, Adil Hussain, and Jennifer Fox, Manoj Bajpayee, Naseeruddin Shah, and Konkona Sensharma among others.

Film festivals established in 2012The history of opera in Latin America dates back to at least the early 18th century. Opera arrived in Latin America as a consequence of European colonization. On October 19, 1701, La púrpura de la rosa premiered in Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru, the first opera known to be composed and performed in the Americas. It is an opera in one act by Spanish composer Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco with a libretto by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, and is the only surviving opera by Torrejón y Velasco. It tells the myth of the love of Venus and Adonis, which provoked Mars's jealousy and his desire for vengeance.
Opera performances were performed also in the country of Mexico. It is within that nation that the first indigenous opera composers of Latin America emerged, with Manuel de Zumaya (c. 1678–1755) being considered the first and most important early opera composer. Outside of Perú and Mexico, opera was slower to gain a foothold, and it wasn't until the early to mid-19th century that other nations in Latin America began producing their own opera composers. Many of these 19th-century operas focus on the historical conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples and were influenced by zarzuela, a form of Spanish opera .

In the 20th century many nationalist operas were composed across Latin America, with particularly thriving opera scenes in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Today, there are numerous active opera houses throughout Latin America and composers continue to write new operas. We also have organizations such as the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC) and Opera Hispanica who are promoting new Latin American operatic repertoire internationally.

18th-century opera
In 1711, the opera Partenope premiered in Mexico City. Its music was by Manuel de Zumaya, the most important Mexican baroque composer. This opera is particularly important because it was the first opera composed in North America and the first opera composed in the Americas by someone from the Americas.

19th-century opera
The first opera composed and premiered in Brazil was José Maurício Nunes Garcia's I Due Gemelli; the text has since been lost. A Noite de São João may be considered the first truly Brazilian opera, with a text in Portuguese by Elias Álvares Lobo. The most famous Brazilian composer was Antônio Carlos Gomes. Many of his operas premiered in Italy, with texts in Italian. However, Gomes often used typically Brazilian themes in his work, such as in his operas Il Guarany and Lo schiavo.

The nineteenth-century opera Guatimotzin by Mexican composer Aniceto Ortega was the first conscious attempt to incorporate pre-Hispanic elements into the formal characteristics of opera. Other important 19th-century Mexican operas are Agorante, rey de la Nubia by Miguel Meneses (premiered during the commemorative festivities for the birthday of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico), Pirro de Aragón by Leonardo Canales, and  Keofar by Felipe Villanueva. The operatic works of Melesio Morales are the most important in Mexico in the 19th century. His operas Romeo y Julieta, Ildegonda, Gino Corsini, and Cleopatra were very successful among the public of Mexico City, and premiered in Europe. The last opera by Melesio Morales, Anita, which was composed in 1908, did not premiere until 2000.

Morales's last period of composition coincided with the creation of operas in Mexico by his son Julio Morales, and the operas of Felipe Villanueva, Ricardo Castro, and Gustavo E. Campa. The work of Ricardo Castro is a part of the tradition of historic, nationalist operas, such as Guatimotzin by Aniceto Ortega, Il Guarany by Antônio Carlos Gomes, Ollanta and Atahualpa by José María Valle Riestra, Huémac by Pascual de Rogatis, and Quiché Vinak by Jesús Castillo. This tradition formed part of a turn-of-the-century operatic movement, in which other important figures included Eliodoro Ortiz de Zárate (Chile), José María Ponce de León (Colombia), Augusto Azzali (Colombia), León Ribeiro (Uruguay), Francisco Hargreaves (Argentina), Miguel Rojas (Argentina), and Edoardo Torrens (Argentina).

The first Venezuelan opera was El maestro Rufo Zapatero, an opera buffa composed by José María Osorio in 1847. (However, many have called Virginia, by José Ángel Montero, the first Venezuelan opera, though it premiered in 1877 under the auspices of the president Antonio Guzmán Blanco) . Earlier, various zarzuelas has been composed, but the first to premiere is believed to be Los alemanes en Italia by José Ángel Montero in the 1860s. Montero also premiered the one-act zarzuelas El Cumpleaños de Leonor, El Charlatán Mudo, La Modista, and many others. Another major Venezuelan composer was Reynaldo Hahn, his operas include Le Merchand de Venise and Ciboulette. Hahn's work was greatly influenced by his teacher Jules Massenet. In zarzuela, another important figure was Pedro Elías Gutiérrez, who incorporated typically Venezuelan rhythms into his work.

Tomás Giribaldi's La Parisina is considered the first Uruguayan opera. It premiered in September 1878. The work was very successful and awakened public interest in operas written by Uruguayan composers. Because of this success, the Uruguayan Oscar Camps y Soler wrote his opera Esmeralda, la gitana, based on the Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame; the opera premiered in Montevideo in 1879. Other Uruguayan composers that wrote opera in this era, motivated by the success of La Parisina, include León Ribeiro and Alfonso Broqua. León Ribeiro premiered his opera Colón in 1892 during the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Alfonso Broqua wrote one opera, Tabaré, based on the eponymous 1888 poem by José Zorrilla de San Martín.

In the 19th and 20th century, a number of operas were produced in Latin America in which conflict between Europeans and indigenous peoples was a theme. Among the most important operas of this type are Liropeya by León Ribeiro (Uruguay); Guatimotzin by Aniceto Ortega (Mexico); Il Guarany by Antonio Carlos Gomes (1836–1896), based on a novel by the Brazilian José Martiniano de Alencar; Atzimba by Ricardo Castro (Mexico, 1864–1907); the three eponymous operas based on the Tabaré by José Zorrilla de San Martín, written, respectively, by Arturo Cosgaya Ceballos (Mexico, 1869–1937), Heliodoro Oseguera (Mexico), and Alfonso Broqua (Uruguay); Los Martirios de Colon written by Federico Ruiz (Venezuela) and the three Ecuadorian operas based on the novel Cumandá o un drama entre salvajes by Juan León Mera, namely Cumandá by Luis H. Salgado (1903–1977), Cumandá o la virgen de las selvas by Pedro Pablo Traversari Salazar (1874–1956),  and Cumandá by Sixto María Durán Cárdenas (1875–1947).

20th century and contemporary opera
  

Argentina

In Argentina, opera developed with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration at the beginning of the century and with the opening of the Teatro Colón in 1908 where most of those world premieres took place. The most influential Argentinian opera composers include Ettore Panizza (whose opera Aurora was commissioned for the Colón inaugural season and Bizancio from 1939), Felipe Boero (El Matrero from 1929 his most famous opera, also Tucumán 1918, Ariana y Dyonisos, 1920, Raquela, 1923 and Siripo, 1937), Juan José Castro (composer of Bodas de sangre and La zapatera prodigiosa, both after Federico Garcia Lorca's plays and Proserpina y el extranjero, 1952), Carlos López Buchardo (El sueño de Alma, 1914), Pascual De Rogatis (Huemac, 1916 and La novia del hereje, 1934), Eduardo Garcia Mansilla (La angelical manuelita,1917), Constantino Gaito (Petronio, 1919; Ollantay, 1926, La sangre de las guitarras), 1927, Floro Ugarte (Saika, 1920), Gilardo Gilardi (Ilse, 1923; La leyenda del urutaú, 1934), Athos Palma (Nazdah, 1924), Hector Iglesias Villoud (El Oro del Inca, 1953), Virtú Maragno and Alberto Ginastera composer of Don Rodrigo, Beatrix Cenci and Bomarzo.

In recent years other Argentinean opera composers include Roberto Garcia Morillo (El caso Maillard, 1977) Mario Perusso (La voz del silencio), Claudio Guidi-Drei (Medea, 1973), Juan Carlos Zorzi (Antigona Velez, 1991 and Don Juan, 1993), Pompeyo Camps (La hacienda, 1987, Marathon, 1990 and La oscuridad de la razón, 1996), Gerardo Gandini (La ciudad ausente, 1995 and Liederkreis, 2000), Ástor Piazzolla (Maria de Buenos Aires) and Osvaldo Golijov (Ainadamar'’). In 2006 Centre for Experimentation (CETC) of Teatro Colón, proposed that national poet Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill work with the composer of his choice. He chose Oscar Edelstein who went on to make the script for ""Eterna flotación: Los Monstruito’"" from two poems of Fogwill, ""Contra el Cristal de La Pecera de Acuario"" (Against the Glass of the Aquarium) "" and ""El Antes de los Monstruito"" from the book ""Lo Dado"", to transform them into a continuous discourse that functions as a dramatic text. The opera dealt with the presidency of Menem and the era of decadency, leading to the headline by music critic, Juan Carlos Montero, ""The Poetic versus Social Degradation.""Brazil

Important Brazilian opera composers in the first half of the 20th century include Heitor Villa-Lobos, the composer of operas such as Izath, Yerma, and Aglaia; and Camargo Guarnieri, composer of Um Homem Só and Pedro Malazarte. Contemporary Brazilian opera continues these avant-garde tendencies, as is the case with works like Olga by Jorge Antunes, A Tempestade by Ronaldo Miranda, O Cientista by Silvio Barbato, and ""Tamanduá (The Anteater) – A Brazilian Opera"" by Joao MacDowell, founder of the International Brazilian Opera Company (IBOC), a New York-based non-profit with a mission to create new repertoire based on collaboration of Brazilian and international artists.

Cuba

Opera has been present in Cuba since the latest part of the 18th century.

 Ecuador

Recent Ecuadorian operas include Los Enemigos by Mesías Maiguashca, based on the story The Secret Miracle by Jorge Luis Borges; Manuela y Bolívar by Diego Luzuriaga; and the instrumental opera El árbol de los pájaros by Arturo Rodas.

Mexico

Another interesting group is those composers that have tried to develop a Yucatecan operatic tradition based on Mayan legends. These composers typically work in Mérida, Yucatán, and have been scorned by Mexican nationalist historians. These composers include Cosgaya Ceballos, Ríos Escalante, Ricalde Moguel, Rivera Velador, Cárdenas Samada, and Jebe Halfdan. In the first half of the 20th century, composer Julián Carrillo was an important figure in Mexican opera, along with composers similar to him, including Antonio Gomezanda, Juan León Mariscal, Julia Alonso, Sofía Cancino de Cuevas, José F. Vásquez, Arnulfo Miramontes, Rafael J. Tello, Francisco Camacho Vega, and Efraín Pérez Cámara. All of these composers have been relegated by official musical historiography, which only recognizes the work of nationalist composers. 
Since the end of the 20th century in Mexico (and in all of Latin America), composers are increasingly interested in writing opera. Important Mexican opera composers in the early 21st century include Federico Ibarra, Daniel Catán, Leandro Espinosa, Marcela Rodríguez, Víctor Rasgado, Javier Álvarez, Roberto Bañuelas, Luis Jaime Cortez, Julio Estrada, Gabriela Ortiz, Enrique González Medina, Manuel Henríquez Romero, Leopoldo Novoa, Hilda Paredes, Mario Stern, René Torres, Juan Trigos, Samuel Zyman, Mathias Hinke, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Isaac Bañuelos, Gabriel de Dios Figueroa, Enrique González-Medina, José Carlos Ibáñez Olvera, Víctor Mendoza and Emmanuel Vázquez.

Venezuela

In contemporary Venezuela, there are great lyrical composers, including María Luisa Escobar, whose works include Kanaime, Orquídeas Azules, and Princesa Girasol.

Transparent Life began in May 2004 as a series of independent comics (through Milwaukee-based CHIMP Comics) with a website.  The series folded after months of poor sales and feedback.

In August 2005, Transparent Life relaunched with Undertoad Comics, an artistic conglomerate led by Beck himself.  The series published five monthly issues before moving entirely to the web at UndertoadComics.com.  December 2005 marked the release of The Collected Transparent Life Volume 1, a compendium of the first five issues and previously unreleased material.  The book experienced moderate sales.

Beck continued to produce new Transparent Life material throughout 2006 and the first half of 2007 (as well as other unrelated work), posting new items to the website once a week.  However, updates ceased almost entirely during late 2007 and all of 2008. 

The site was relaunched with regular updates in March 2009.  Beck's next book collection, The Collected Transparent Life Volume 2 was also released in March, after being delayed for over two years.  In June, Beck's first full-length graphic novel, Transparent Life: 1000 Miles, began serialization on the website, finally completing in late September 2010.  The website resumed normal weekly updates of shorter material in November of the same year.

Background
Lewis was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia and is the nephew of Queensland legend Wally Lewis and cousin of actor Lincoln Lewis.

Lewis played his junior football for the Capalaba Warriors and the Souths Logan Magpies and was educated at Iona College, playing alongside future Waratah-turned-Rebel Brad Wilkin before being signed by the Canberra Raiders. Lewis represented the Queensland under 16s and 18s team. Lewis played for the Raiders NYC team in 2014-2016. On 17 April 2016, Lewis signed a 2-year contract with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs effective immediately. Lewis played 10 matches for the Bulldogs NYC team in 2016. On 13 July 2016, Lewis represented the Queensland Under 20s team against the New South Wales Under-20s team, playing off the interchange bench in the 36-22 loss at Suncorp Stadium. Lewis played for the Bulldogs NSW Cup team in 2017. Outside of Rugby League, Lewis is also a Licensed Plumber and stereo salesman.

Playing career

2018
Lewis spent the first half of the season playing in Canterbury's NSW Cup team before the mid-season departure of Moses Mbye to the Wests Tigers and marquee half Kieran Foran was ruled out for the rest of the season after Round 12 due to a toe injury. In Round 16 of the 2018 NRL season, Lewis made his NRL debut for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs against the Newcastle Knights, playing at five-eighth in the 36-16 win at Hunter Stadium. On 18 July 2018, Lewis extended his contract with the Bulldogs to the end of the 2020 season. In Round 23 against the New Zealand Warriors, on his 22nd birthday, Lewis had exceptional match, scoring a try and kicking a field goal with 2 minutes remaining to win the match for the Bulldogs 27-26 at ANZ Stadium. Lewis finished his debut year in the NRL playing in 9 matches, scoring 1 try and kicking 1 field goal for the Bulldogs in the 2018 NRL season.

2019
In the Good Friday Round 6 match against South Sydney, Lewis had a sledging battle with Souths captain Sam Burgess who said to Lewis that he would be “Found Out”. When Burgess would target the smaller Lewis, who is 26 kg lighter, Lewis put on big hits and forced an error from Burgess which got him frustrated and was deliberately slowing down the rucks during Canterbury's 14-6 loss at ANZ Stadium. Lewis commented that his battle with Burgess “It was probably like a fly hitting a car - it didn’t look like it affected him at all.”

Following Canterbury's round 8 loss to Manly, Lewis was demoted to reserve grade by coach Dean Pay and was replaced by Jack Cogger.  At the time of his demotion, Canterbury had only won 2 of their first 6 games.

Lewis made a total of 15 appearances for Canterbury-Bankstown in the 2019 NRL season as the club finished 12th on the table.  At one stage of the season, Canterbury were in last position on the ladder before achieving four upset victories in a row over Penrith, the Wests Tigers, South Sydney and Parramatta who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table.

2020
Lewis made 13 appearances for Canterbury in the 2020 NRL season.  The club finished in 15th place on the table, only avoiding the Wooden Spoon by for and against.

2021
In round 17 of the 2021 NRL season, Lewis scored two tries for Canterbury in a 22-16 loss against the Sydney Roosters, which left the club bottom of the table, four points adrift of second last Brisbane.

The following week, Lewis was bizarrely sent to the sin bin after the half-time siren when he grabbed South Sydney player Cody Walker and threw him to the ground.  Canterbury would go on to lose the match 32-24.

On 31 August, Lewis was one of twelve players who were told by Canterbury that they would not be offered a contract for the 2022 season and would be released at season's end.

Controversy
On 27 August 2021, Lewis was stood down by Canterbury after allegedly trying to sell on Ebay a soundbar provided by the NRL to teams in lockdown. The matter was referred onto the NRL Integrity Unit.

The site is deciduous woodland with the main trees being beach and hornbeam. The Great Storm of 1987 brought down several trees, creating open areas which were colonised by flowers such as bluebell and yellow archangel. Dead wood is kept to provide a habitat for insects and fungi. Birds include great spotted woodpeckers and treecreepers.

There is access from Farmers Way and Long Grove Lane.

Communes of Haute-SaôneLorenzo Carlo Domenico Milani Comparetti (27 May 1923 – 26 June 1967) was an Italian Catholic priest. He was an educator of poor children and an advocate of conscientious objection.

Biography
Lorenzo Milani was born in Florence in 1923 to a rich middle-class family. His father, Albano Milani, and his mother, Alice Weiss, were staunch secularists. Alice Weiss was Jewish and a cousin of Edoardo Weiss, one of Sigmund Freud's earliest disciples and the founder of the Italian Psychoanalytic Association. Milani's paternal great-grandfather was Domenico Comparetti, a leading nineteenth-century philologist. In his own work as an educationist, Milani emphasized learning how to use words effectively.

In June 1943, after a period of study at the Brera Academy, Milani converted from agnosticism to Catholicism, perhaps after a chance conversation with Don Raffaele Bensi, who later became his spiritual director. He also exchanged a complacency of the economically fortunate for solidarity with the poor and despised. He was ordained a priest in 1947 and sent to assist Don Daniele Pugi, the old parish priest of San Donato in Calenzano. There he established his first ""school of the people"" (scuola popolare), The fact that it served children from both believing and non-believing families scandalized conservative Catholic circles. After Pugi's death in 1954, Milani was sent to Barbiana, a small, remote village in the Mugello region.

At Barbiana, Milani continued his radical educational activities despite both clerical and lay opposition.

Writings

In the spring of 1958, he published his first book, Pastoral Experiences (Esperienze pastorali). In December the Holy Office ordered its withdrawal from circulation as ""inopportune"". despite failing to find in it any errors of doctrine or breaches of ecclesiastical discipline. Milani made no public objection.

In his ""Letter to Military Chaplains"" (""Lettera ai cappellani militari""}, and a later letter to judges he advocated conscientious objection, the right to say ""No"". His writings on this subject are recognized as important contributions to anti-military education. In 1965, Milani was put on trial for these writings.

Working for a year with his pupils, Milani coordinated the production of Letter to a Teacher (Lettera a una professoressa), which denounced the inequalities of a class-based educational system that advantaged the children of the rich over those of the poor. It was composed by eight boys from the school of Barbiana, according to the ""group writing"" method inspired by the cooperative writing method promoted by Mario Lodi and influenced by Celesine Freinet. Lodi visited Barbiana and his students engaged in exchanges with those at Barbiana. It has been translated into about forty languages. It introduces many of the themes that became prominent in the later development of the Sociology of Education. The text served as a manifesto for the 68 movement, serving as an indictment of not only the Italian schooling system but Italian society at large.

Death and legacy

In 1967, shortly after the publication of Letter to a Teacher, Milani died in his mother's house in Florence of leukemia.

In 2008 Helena Dalli, an MP and member of the Malta Labour Party, summarized Milani's life and work: ""Milani's ideas were considered dangerously radical and his bishop sent him into a sort of internal exile to a small mountain village north of Florence called Barbiana, thought too remote for him to cause problems. He started a full-time school there for children who had been failed or abandoned by the traditional education system. Eventually, hundreds of pupils of all ages were attracted to his teaching methods. Artists, farmers, scientists, artisans and professionals were invited to give hands-on explanations of their activities. Pupils were also made to read and evaluate national and international news. The aim was to educate them to analyze events critically so as to face life without fear and to solve problems with determination and awareness.""

A documentary film from RAI describes Lorenzo Milani's educational project and its impact on Italian society. The film includes interviews with former students of the school at Barbiana and others. (The film is available with English text).

Pope Francis visited Barbiana on 20 June 2017 to visit and pray at Milani's tomb. He also visited the tomb of another pacifist and advocate for the poor Primo Mazzolari (1890-1959) in Bozzolo.

Tax preparation software with e-filing capabilities includes stand-alone programs or websites. Tax professionals use tax preparation software from major software vendors for commercial use.

Of the 139.3 million US returns filed in 2007, 79.98 million (or about 57.4 percent) were filed electronically. In 2010, a total of 129.3 million US returns were filed, and 93.4 million were filed electronically: in three years the percentage of returns filed electronically increased to 72.3 percent of total returns. In 2018, 89% of tax returns were filed electronically.

Taxpayers can e-file free using the IRS Free File service, either using an authorized IRS e-file provider's tax software, if eligible, or by using online Free File Fillable Forms from the Free File Alliance. Prior to 2020, the use of a third party was required for IRS e-file, and it was not possible to e-file directly through the IRS website. In 2020, the IRS made direct e-filing possible through IRS Free File Fillable Forms available to taxpayers of any income level.

History
The IRS started electronic filing in 1986 to lower operating costs and paper usage. Since then, additional features have been added. In 1987 Electronic Direct Deposit was added as a form of payment. Milestones have been set and broken throughout the years. In 1990 4.2 million returns were reached and in recent years a record of 1 billion 1040's have been E-filed. E-filing originally used the processing system developed in 1969 by the IRS but, since 2003, the IRS has been developing a new enhanced processing system called CADE.

Types of e-file providers
The IRS accepts electronic submission of a variety of tax forms through their IRS Authorized e-file Providers. The IRS offers e-filing to most forms ranging from 1040's to 2290's to 990's.

Individual returns
Individuals have the option of both free and paid tax software. Recently a feature from the IRS called FreeFile allows users to file their individual tax returns for free. It is also possible to go through an authorized efile company that files Form 1040 with a service charge. FreeFile is free, it's an easy step by step system for those who make less than $64,000 annually and a more task-heavy form of filing for those who make above $64,000. For those who make more than $64,000 a year, the FreeFile is not step-by-step but an actual Form 1040 that can be filled out, box by box, electronically.

Business returns
Businesses and self-employed taxpayers can choose from a variety of commercial e-file services depending on their individual needs. Some of the forms that fall under business returns include Form 2290 (truck tax), Form 1099 (reporting payments to individuals other than employees). IRS has no set pricing for each form, so each filing company sets their own price accordingly. IRS has a list of authorized websites that do e-filing for some forms.

Tax exempt organization returns
Tax exempt organizations may file the annual information return IRS Form 990, Form 990-EZ and Form 990-N with a variety of independent tax software providers. As with the business returns, the IRS does not set prices; each e-filing company sets their own.

Authorized filers
IRS e-filer providers must be authorized by the IRS. The IRS provides a list of authorized e-file providers on some forms. The authorized providers must pass the testing every year. The IRS changes the order of the certified providers list daily for fairness.

17,27,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type3,"""See How They Fly"" is the ninth episode and series finale of the HBO superhero drama miniseries Watchmen, based on the 1986 DC Comics series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It was written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof and directed by Frederick E.O. Toye, and aired on December 15, 2019. The finale sees the two competing plots within Tulsa to kidnap Doctor Manhattan come to a head, while Adrian Veidt prepares to finally escape his exile.

Synopsis
Trieu, shown to be the daughter of Adrian Veidt from artificial insemination, visits Veidt in Karnak in 2008. She reveals her relation to Veidt as well as her knowledge that he engineered the 1985 squid attack (and subsequent squid rains), but warns that it did not produce his desired outcome of lasting world peace. Trieu requests Veidt's financial assistance to build a quantum centrifuge capable of extracting Doctor Manhattan's powers, in hopes of finding a more permanent solution for saving humanity. Trieu reveals she knows Manhattan is on Europa and has launched a probe to arrive there in 2013 to visually confirm his whereabouts. Veidt refuses to help or acknowledge her as his daughter.

On Europa, Veidt uses the horseshoe to escape his cell as a spacecraft lands outside the castle. The Game Warden tries to stop him, but Veidt stabs him with the horseshoe, revealing he created the Game Warden to be an adversary over the last eight years. The craft lifts off, showing that Veidt had spelled out ""SAVE ME DAUGHTER"" using the clones' bodies for Trieu's probe to capture. Veidt is encased in gold for the return trip. Trieu is shown to have recovered the craft after it crashed at the Clarks' farm, and kept Veidt as a statue in her vivarium garden since then. Trieu revives Veidt with an hour left before the Millennium Clock activates; Veidt is impressed that she successfully built the centrifuge, but is appalled that Trieu cloned her mother Bian. The centrifuge detaches from the clock and floats towards the Greenwood district of Tulsa, while Trieu and her staff set up equipment underneath it.

At the Kavalry headquarters, several high-ranking politicians arrive, revealed as members of Cyclops, including the elder Joe Keene Sr. Laurie discovers that Wade has disguised himself as one of the Kavalry, having survived the attack at his house. Doctor Manhattan is teleported to the headquarters following the Kavalry attack on Angela's house. Joe explains to the gathered audience that Cyclops' original long-term plan was to revolt against President Robert Redford by arranging racially-charged events like the White Night. After discovering Manhattan's presence on Earth when one of the Kavalry members was teleported to New Mexico during the White Night, the Kavalry changed course and decided to obtain Manhattan's powers.

Angela shows up to try to stop the event, but Keene ignores her warning. He enters a booth, but just as the system is activated, the entire area is teleported to Greenwood by Trieu. Trieu explains she needed the Kavalry to capture Manhattan without him detecting her own involvement. Due to the Kavalry's ineffective safety measures, Keene is liquefied during the process; his remains spill across the area and into Manhattan's cage once Trieu opens the booth. Trieu proceeds to kill the Cyclops members on behalf of Will as revenge for their crimes against people of color. During this time, Manhattan uses Keene's liquid remains to circumvent the cage inhibiting his powers, teleporting Veidt, Laurie, and Wade to Karnak. Manhattan tells Angela he did not teleport her as he did not want to be alone when he dies, as Trieu activates the centrifuge to take Manhattan's powers. Manhattan tells Angela he loves her before he is destroyed and his powers are captured.

At Karnak, Veidt uses the device spawning the benign squid rains to generate a more destructive storm of frozen squid over Tulsa. Laurie calls Angela in time to allow her and Bian to take cover, while the squid rain destroys the centrifuge before the transfer of Manhattan's powers can be completed, killing Trieu when it falls onto her. Angela takes shelter at a nearby movie theater, where Will is waiting for her with her children. Will reveals Manhattan had made a deal with himself and Trieu, having anticipated the events of the night in order to ensure his powers are not placed in the wrong hands.

Veidt offers Laurie and Wade Nite Owl's airship ""Archie"" (short for Archimedes in the original comic) to return to society. Laurie places Veidt under arrest, with Wade having a copy of Veidt's 1985 tape to President Redford on hand as evidence.

Angela invites Will to stay with her family as she takes her children back home. As she cleans up broken eggs from an argument between her and Manhattan earlier in the night, she recalls that Manhattan told her once that he could transfer his powers to someone else through an organic medium. Finding an unbroken egg, Angela goes to her pool, eats the egg, and prepares to walk on water across the pool. The screen cuts to black as her foot touches the water.

Production
Lindelof stated that the writers had decided early in production that the series finale would revolve around Lady Trieu attempting to take Doctor Manhattan's powers for herself. They had additionally written an idea for Senator Keene to have a mind control device capable of controlling the Seventh Kavalry and Tulsa police through their masks, which would culminate in Will taking control of the device. During production of subsequent episodes, the writers instead opted to have the Kavalry themselves attempt to capture Doctor Manhattan, and reworked Trieu's plot to work in conjunction with the Kavalry storyline. Additionally, the writers decided on a climax involving a squid attack over Tulsa, in hopes of evoking the city-wide devastation at the end of the original comic.

The episode uses the Spooky Tooth cover of ""I Am the Walrus"" by The Beatles as the credits song. Lindelof stated that ""I Am the Walrus"" is well known to have imaginative lyrics that The Beatles themselves have not offered to explain. Lindelof and the writers found ways to incorporate many of the song's lyrics into the episode. The episode's title, ""See How They Fly,"" refers to the falling frozen squid, while other lyrics like ""Pretty little policemen in a row"" and ""Yellow matter custard Dripping from a dead dog's eye"" were reflected in visual elements of the episode.

Lindelof and his team had considered three possible endings of this episode: in addition to the one where Angela eats the egg and attempts to step onto the pool, they considered one where she simply crushed the egg in her hand, and another of putting the egg back into the carton and into the refrigerator. Staying with the choice where Angela eats the egg, they then debated how far they should go with the final shot, cutting the scene short to leave the implication vague. Lindelof said he does not consider the ending to be a cliffhanger, and that he intended to imply that Angela received Doctor Manhattan's powers via the egg. The question of what Angela would do with Doctor Manhattan's powers with a guiding element in the series' development.

It carries the main A970 road to Hillswick in the north west of Shetland and is about two miles west of the settlement of Brae.

Mavis Grind is said to be the only place in the UK where you can toss a stone across land from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is a regular crossing point for otters, which in Shetland are sea-dwelling. In 1999, local volunteers successfully helped to demonstrate whether Viking ships could be carried across the isthmus, instead of sailing around the end of the island.

NorthmavineTempera (), also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, usually glutinous material such as egg yolk. Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long-lasting, and examples from the first century AD still exist.  Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by oil painting.  A paint consisting of pigment and binder commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as ""tempera paint"", although the binders in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint.

Etymology
The term tempera is derived from the Italian dipingere a tempera (""paint in distemper""), from the Late Latin distemperare (""mix thoroughly"").

History

Tempera painting has been found on early Egyptian sarcophagus decorations. Many of the Fayum mummy portraits use tempera, sometimes in combination with encaustic painting with melted wax,  the alternative painting technique in the ancient world. It was also used for the murals of the 3rd century Dura-Europos synagogue. 

A related technique has been used also in ancient and early medieval paintings found in several caves and rock-cut temples of India. High-quality art with the help of tempera was created in Bagh Caves between the late 4th and 10th centuries and in the 7th century in Ravan Chhaya rock shelter, Odisha.

The art technique was known from the classical world, where it appears to have taken over from encaustic painting and was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and Medieval and Early Renaissance Europe. Tempera painting was the primary panel painting medium for nearly every painter in the European Medieval and Early renaissance period up to 1500. For example, most surviving panel paintings attributed to Michelangelo are executed in egg tempera, an exception being his Doni Tondo which uses both tempera and oil paint.

Oil paint, which may have originated in Afghanistan between the 5th and 9th centuries and migrated westward in the Middle Ages eventually superseded tempera. Oil replaced tempera as the principal medium used for creating artwork during the 15th century in Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe. Around 1500, oil paint replaced tempera in Italy. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were intermittent revivals of tempera technique in Western art, among the Pre-Raphaelites, Social Realists, and others. Tempera painting continues to be used in Greece and Russia where it is the traditional medium for Orthodox icons.

Technique
Tempera is traditionally created by hand-grinding dry powdered pigments into a binding agent or medium, such as egg yolk, milk (in the form of casein) and a variety of plant gums.

Egg tempera
The most common form of classical tempera painting is ""egg tempera"". For this form most often only the contents of the egg yolk is used. The white of the egg and the membrane of the yolk are discarded (the membrane of the yolk is dangled over a receptacle and punctured to drain off the liquid inside). Egg yolk is rarely used by itself with pigment; it dries almost immediately and can crack when it is dry. Some agent is always added, in variable proportions. One recipe calls for vinegar, but only in small amounts. A few drops of vinegar will preserve the solution for a week. (1:3, 3 parts water, 1 part yolk; other recipes suggest white wine (1 part yolk, 2 parts wine). Some schools of egg tempera use various mixtures of egg yolk and water.

Powdered pigment, or pigment that has been ground in distilled water, is placed onto a palette or bowl and mixed with a roughly equal volume of the binder. Some pigments require slightly more binder, some require less.

When used to paint icons on church walls, liquid myrrh is sometimes added to the mixture to give the paint a pleasing odor, particularly as worshippers may find the egg tempera somewhat pungent for quite some time after completion.  The paint mixture has to be constantly adjusted to maintain a balance between a ""greasy"" and ""watery"" consistency by adjusting the amount of water and yolk. As tempera dries, the artist will add more water to preserve the consistency and to balance the thickening of the yolk on contact with air. Once prepared, the paint cannot be stored. Egg tempera is water-resistant, but not waterproof. Different preparations use the egg white or the whole egg for a different effect. Other additives such as oil and wax emulsions can modify the medium.  Egg tempera is not a flexible paint and requires stiff boards; painting on canvas will cause cracks to form and chips of paint to fall off.

Tempera grassa
Adding oil in no more than a 1:1 ratio with the egg yolk by volume produces a water-soluble medium with many of the color effects of oil paint, although it cannot be painted thickly.

Pigments
Some of the pigments used by medieval painters, such as cinnabar (contains mercury), orpiment (contains arsenic), or lead white (contains lead) are highly toxic. Most artists today use modern synthetic pigments, which are less toxic but have similar color properties to the older pigments. Even so, many (if not most) modern pigments are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken; these include keeping pigments wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust.

Application
Tempera paint dries rapidly. It is normally applied in thin, semi-opaque or transparent layers. Tempera painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques that require the application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross-hatching technique. When dry, it produces a smooth matte finish. Because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can, tempera paintings rarely have the deep color saturation that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less pigment (lower pigment load). In this respect, the colors of an unvarnished tempera painting resemble a pastel, although the color deepens if a varnish is applied. On the other hand, tempera colors do not change over time, whereas oil paints darken, yellow, and become transparent with age.

Ground

Tempera adheres best to an absorbent ground that has a lower oil content than the tempera binder used (the traditional rule of thumb is ""fat over lean"", and never the other way around). The ground traditionally used is inflexible Italian gesso, and the substrate is usually rigid as well. Historically wood panels were used as the substrate, and more recently un-tempered masonite or medium density fiberboard (MDF) have been employed; heavy paper is also used.

Pre-made paints
Apart from the traditional process of mixing pigment with egg yolk, new methods include egg tempera sold in tubes by manufacturers such as Sennelier and Daler-Rowney. These paints do contain a slight amount of oil to enhance durability within the container. Marc Chagall used Sennelier egg tempera tube paints extensively.

Artists
Although tempera has been out of favor since the Late Renaissance and Baroque eras, it has been periodically rediscovered by later artists such as William Blake, the Nazarenes, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Joseph Southall. The 20th century saw a significant revival of tempera. European painters who worked with tempera include Giorgio de Chirico, Otto Dix, Eliot Hodgkin, Pyke Koch, and Pietro Annigoni, who used an emulsion of egg yolks, stand oil and varnish.

Spanish surrealist painter Remedios Varo worked extensively in egg tempera.

Revival in 20th-century American art

The tempera medium was used by American artists such as the Regionalists Andrew Wyeth, Thomas Hart Benton and his students James Duard Marshall and Roger Medearis; expressionists Ben Shahn, Mitchell Siporin and John Langley Howard, magic realists George Tooker, Paul Cadmus, Jared French, Julia Thecla and Louise E. Marianetti, realist painter David Hanna; Art Students League of New York instructors Kenneth Hayes Miller and William C. Palmer, Social Realists Kyra Markham, Isabel Bishop, Reginald Marsh, and Noel Rockmore, Edward Laning, Anton Refregier, Jacob Lawrence, Rudolph F. Zallinger, Robert Vickrey, Peter Hurd, and science fiction artist John Schoenherr, notable as the cover artist of Dune.

20th-century Indian art
In the early part of the 20th century, a large number of Indian artists, notably of the Bengal school took up tempera as one of their primary media of expression. Artists such as Gaganendranath Tagore, Asit Kumar Haldar, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Kalipada Ghoshal and Sughra Rababi were foremost. After the 1950s, artists such as Jamini Roy and Ganesh Pyne established tempera as a medium for the new age artists of India.

In contemporary art
Other practicing tempera artists include Philip Aziz, Ernst Fuchs, Antonio Roybal, George Huszar, Donald Jackson, Tim Lowly, Altoon Sultan, Shaul Shats,  Sandro Chia, Alex Colville, Robert Vickrey, Andrew Wyeth, Andrew Grassie, and Ganesh Pyne.

48,29,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type7,"Everybody Get Agenda is the 6th studio album by BANTU released on September 23, 2020 on Soledad Productions. Like their previous album Agberos International, this long player was composed and written by all members of the band. It was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria and mixed in Cologne, Germany. The music style is Afrofunk and Afrobeat with elements of Yoruba music, Soul, Jazz and Rap.

Background
The album title is taken from the chorus line of the song ""Cash And Carry"" which is also featured on the album. The lyrics on ""Everybody Get Agenda"" center around corruption in Nigeria, the Mediterranean migration crisis, urban alienation, xenophobia, authoritarian rule and oppressive policies in Africa. Prior to the album's official release, BANTU released two singles with accompanying music videos. The first single “Disrupt The Programme” was released in April 2020. Six weeks later this was followed by an animated music video to ""Animal Carnival"". The release of “Everybody Get Agenda” was accompanied by a music video to “Cash And Carry”. The album features guest vocal performances by Seun Kuti on the song ""Yeye Theory"".

Remixes
Unlike previous album projects, BANTU has released a string of remix singles from the ""Everybody Get Agenda"" album. The band collaborated with Ghanaian Rap duo Fokn Bois for the remix of ""Animal Carnival"". The song includes additional rap verses by M3NSA & Wanlov the Kubolor. German House producer Razoof provided two remixes for ""Yeye Theory"" and ""Animal Carnival"" while Ghanaian Stallion produced a remix for their song ""Cash And Carry"" with a guest feature by German rapper Megaloh.

Critical reception
German weekly newsmagazine Stern Magazin wrote: ""Afrobeat, Highlife, Funk, Jazz, Soul: the Nigerian ensemble BANTU brews an inspiring groove cocktail and doesn't skimp on political messages. A worldmusic masterpiece"".Le Monde’s Fabien Mollon commented, ""Composed of thirteen musicians and led by the German-Nigerian singer Adé Bantu, this collective also walks in the footsteps of the ""king"" of Afrobeat, whose spirit they perpetuate, both in substance and in form"". Lucy Ilado of Music In Africa wrote, ""Everybody Get Agenda like all previous BANTU albums is a reflection not only of the socio-political atmosphere in Nigeria but also that of the continent. This positions BANTU as one of Africa's most politically driven bands"". Chinonso Ihekire of The Guardian Newspaper noted ""in this latest 10-track offering from the 13-man band, BANTU vividly x-rays Nigeria’s perennial socio-political problems, in the most relatable manner; and while the album preaches that change is possible, listening to it would tell you why"".

""Everybody Get Agenda"" peaked at the number 3 spot on the Trans Global World Music Charts (November 2020)  and the number 5 spot on the Europe World Music Chart (December 2020). It was listed on ""The Best Nigerian albums of 2020"" by Music In Africa (Dec 2020)

62,30,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type5,"Ragnarok: The Age of Fire and Gravel is a book by Minnesota politician Ignatius L. Donnelly published first in 1883. It is a companion to the more well-known work Atlantis: The Antediluvian World.

Author's arguments
In Ragnarok, Donnelly argues that an enormous comet hit the earth 12,000 years ago, resulting in widespread fires, floods, poisonous gases, and unusually vicious and prolonged winters. The catastrophe destroyed a more advanced civilization, forcing its terrified population to seek shelter in caves. As cave-dwellers, they lost all knowledge of art, literature, music, philosophy, and engineering (see Ragnarök).

He cites as evidence 900-foot-deep cracks radiating outward from the Great Lakes, and stretching for many miles away. He admits it has been proposed that ice-sheets caused these cracks, but suggests that this explanation is improbable, likening them instead to ""cracks in a window which has been struck with a stone"". If ice sheets could produce such cracks, he asks, why have not similar cracks been found anywhere else on the globe? He adds to this a discussion of surface rocks in New York City, which seem to have undergone a radical chemical change—the feldspar has been converted into slate and the mica has separated out from the iron, as if they had undergone tremendous heat and pressure, as they likely would in the event that a comet struck the earth. He rules out other theories that could have caused this, such as nitric acid and warm rains, by stating that this is an isolated incident, whereas warm rains can occur at any time and place and there's no archaeological evidence for the nitric acid's origins.

He indicates many legends and myths from various cultures, such as Zoroastrian, Pictish, Hindu, and Ancient Greece, that are all suggestive of a comet striking the earth, the earth catching fire, poisonous gases choking people, and floods and tidal waves swamping large areas. He also discusses early culture's tendency to heliotheism, which he said evolved from gratitude to the Sun, after so many horrific days without it.

States and territories established in 2003John Somerville (1560–1583) was the son of John Somerville (d. in or after 1579), of Edstone, Warwickshire, and Elizabeth Corbett of Lee, Shropshire.

Somerville publicly exclaimed his desire and intention to assassinate Elizabeth I of England. However, it is likely that he was of unsound mind, and had neither the inclination nor capacity to carry out his threat. Nevertheless, the deeply suspicious Elizabethan security services took him seriously; perhaps as a precaution or to make an example, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and tortured. He was alleged to have hanged himself in jail before he could be executed.

Somerville's outburst had dire consequences for his kin. His father-in-law, Edward Arden was also arrested, tortured, tried and found guilty of treason by Christopher Wray. He was executed at Smithfield on 20 December 1583. His wife and daughter were also imprisoned in the Tower but later spared.

While it is possible that the Somerville and Arden case was dealt with maliciously by Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Warwickshire was a stronghold of Catholic recusancy. Moreover, a number of well established, and inter-linked, families of the county, such as the Throckmortons, Catesbys and Treshams were all variously implicated in real conspiracies – including the Gunpowder Plot.

Marriage and issue
Somerville married Margaret Arden, the daughter of Sir Edward Arden of Park Hall by Mary Throckmorton (d.1603), the daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton and his first wife, Muriel Berkeley, by whom he had two daughters, Elizabeth and Alice.

5,33,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type1,"The Ritual Decalogue is a list of laws at . These laws are similar to the Covenant Code and are followed by the phrase ""ten commandments"" ( , in ). Although the phrase ""Ten Commandments"" has traditionally been interpreted as referring to a very different set of laws, in , many scholars believe it instead refers to the Ritual Decalogue found two verses earlier.

Critical biblical scholars understand the two sets of laws to have different authorship.
Early scholars, adopting a proposal of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, contrasted the ""Ritual"" Decalogue with the ""Ethical"" Decalogue of  and , which are the texts more generally known as the Ten Commandments.  Believing that the Bible reflected a shift over time from an emphasis on the ritual to the ethical, they argued that the Ritual Decalogue was composed earlier than the Ethical Decalogue.
Later scholars have held that they were actually parallel developments, with the Ethical Decalogue a late addition to Exodus copied from Deuteronomy, or that the Ritual Decalogue was the later of the two, a conservative reaction to the secular Ethical Decalogue.
A few Bible scholars call the verses in Exodus 34 the ""small Covenant code"", as it appears to be a compact version of the Covenant Code in Exodus –; they argue the small Covenant code was composed around the same time as the Decalogue of Exodus 20, but either served different functions within Israelite religion, or reflects the influence of other Ancient Near Eastern religious texts.

The word decalogue comes from the Greek name for the Ten Commandments,  (; ""ten terms""), a translation of the Hebrew  ( ""the ten items/terms"").

Biblical context
The Ritual Decalogue is framed in the context of God making a covenant with Israel:

Yahweh said to Moses, Cut two tablets of stone like the former ones, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets, which you broke. ... I hereby make a covenant.
 [Commandments of Exodus 34]
 Yahweh said to Moses, Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. ... And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments [ ].

Assuming that Moses is being commanded to write down the content of verses 15-26 on the new tablets, this would be the only place in the Bible where the phrase Ten Commandments identifies an explicit set of commandments.

Interpretations
While Orthodox Judaism and Christianity hold that both sets contained the same ten commandments, some scholars identify verses 11-26 as an alternate ""ten commandments"" which they call the ""ritual"" decalogue. For these scholars, the terms ""ritual decalogue"" and ""ethical decalogue"" are a way of distinguishing between alternate inscriptions of the ten commandments.

The commandments in the Ritual Decalogue are expanded upon in the Covenant Code, which occurs prior to it in the Torah, and thus have the impression of being a summary of the important points in the Code. The Covenant Code is believed by most scholars of biblical criticism as having originally been a separate text to the Torah, and thus there is much debate as to the relationship between the Ritual Decalogue and Covenant Code.  There are essentially two positions, neither of which is decisively supported, either by evidence, or by number of scholars:

 Either the commandments of the Ritual Decalogue were originally indistinct commandments in the body of a much larger work, such as the Covenant Code, and were selected as being the most important by some process, whether gradual filtering or by an individual,
 Or the Covenant Code represents a later expansion of the Ritual Decalogue, with additional commandments added on, again either by gradual aggregation, or by an individual.

The documentary hypothesis identifies the Ritual Decalogue as the work of the Jahwist, from the Kingdom of Judah, and the Covenant Code as that of the Elohist, from the Kingdom of Israel, both writing independently. It does not however answer the question of how these texts were related, merely that the Ritual Decalogue circulated in Judah, and the Covenant Code in Israel. What the documentary hypothesis does partly explain is the relationship of the Ritual Decalogue to the Ethical Decalogue, and why, instead of the Ethical Decalogue, it is the Ritual Decalogue which is written on the two tablets when Moses ascends the mountain to have the Ethical Decalogue inscribed for a second time.

The documentary hypothesis claims that the Jahwist and Elohist texts were first combined by a redactor, producing a text referred to simply as JE, in such a way that it now reads that God dictated the Covenant Code, which was written onto stone, Moses subsequently smashing these stones at the incident of the golden calf, and thus having to go back and get a new set, with a set of commandments, the Ritual Decalogue, resembling the first. Under this reconstruction another writer, the Priestly source, later took offence at parts of JE, and rewrote it, dropping the story of the golden calf, and replacing the Ritual Decalogue with a new (ethical) decalogue initially based on it, but taking commandments from elsewhere as well, and replacing the Covenant Code with a vast new law code, placed after the Decalogue for narrative reasons, most of which forms the greater part of the mitzvot in Leviticus.

The reconstruction then suggests that a century later yet another writer, the Deuteronomist, objected to the Priestly source, and rewrote it yet again, but in a different style:  that of a series of flashbacks, producing a second slightly different copy of the Ethical Decalogue, and re-introducing the golden calf. Presented with such divergent versions of the same event, a later redactor is thought to have combined all three versions – JE, the Priestly source, and Deuteronomist, together. JE and the Priestly source were interleaved together, altering JE so that it was now the Ethical Decalogue which was written on the first set of tablets and subsequently destroyed. The alteration, by careful juxtaposition, subtly implied that the second set of tablets also received the Ethical rather than Ritual Decalogue, despite the text saying, immediately after the Ritual Decalogue,
 The  said to Moses, Write these words; in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel. [...] And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments [emphasis added]

Decalogues compared
Besides its appearance in , where ""[t]raditionally, it is taken as a reference back to the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20"", the phrase  also appears in , where it is associated with the Ten Commandments of Deuteronomy 5, and in .

Covenant codes compared
Some scholars, calling attention to , ""Then the  said: 'I am making a covenant with you',"" note that the laws of Exodus 34 appear to be a shorter and differently organized version of the Covenant Code (). These have been differentiated as the ""Small Covenant Code"" (Exodus 34) and the ""Large Covenant Code"" (Exodus 20–23). These views are not mutually exclusive. Aaron (2006), for example, discusses how the ""Exodus 34 Decalogue"", while presented as the Ten Commandments, appears to be a reworking of the Covenant Code. Indeed, H.L. Ginsberg believed that the Ritual Decalogue was an interpolation, and that the phrase ""Ten Commandments"" in Exodus 34:28 originally referred to a portion of the Covenant Code, , which he called the First Ritual Decalogue.

He is also serving as Haryana BJP media-in-charge since his appointment in April 2018.

Career 
In 2014,  Umesh Aggarwal won the 2014 Haryana Legislative Assembly election with a record margin of 84,095 votes from Gurgaon, defeating Gopi Chand Gehlot of Indian National Lok Dal. In April 2018, he was appointed as the state media-in-charge of Bharatiya Janata Party in Haryana.

Criminal Allegations
In 2015, a Delhi court had put Umesh Aggarwal and Sandeep Luthra for allegedly raping a woman in a hotel after giving her sedative-laced drink.

However, in 2017 the court absolved them for alleged offences of rape on the grounds that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case against them beyond reasonable doubt. The three accused had argued that there was a monetary dispute between the woman and Rekha Suri (the third person accused and friend of the woman), due to which allegations were made by her against all the three. Additional Sessions Judge Shail Jain said the woman had turned hostile and there was nothing incriminating against the accused. The judge also dispensed with the recording of the statements of the accused.

It was part of the West Indies squadron and served transporting U.S. sailors, marines and supplies to the pirate infested waters of the Caribbean and was used to search out and attack pirate ships and pirate strongholds.

Acquisition and commissioning
In 1822, the U.S. Navy purchased Terrier at Baltimore, Maryland, for service in Commodore David Porter's (1780–1843) ""Mosquito Fleet"" in conjunction with the campaign to suppress pirates in the West Indies. Outfitted at Norfolk, Virginia, during the latter part of 1822, she was commissioned sometime early in 1823 as USS Terrier with Lieutenant Robert M. Rose in command.

Operational career
Terrier departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the other ships of Porter's squadron on 15 February 1823. The ships reached St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies on 3 March 1823 and began patrolling the coast of Puerto Rico the next day.

Terrier and the seven other shallow-draft schooners acquired at Baltimore were ideally suited to the work of exploring the coastal shallows and shoal waters of the Caribbean where the pirates were based. For the next two years, Terrier operated out of the depot Porter established at what is now Key West, Florida, and remained almost continually on station even during the two outbreaks of yellow fever – in the autumn of 1823 and the summer of 1824 – which sent the majority of the squadron's ships north to healthier latitudes. Terriers area of concentration was the northern coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico, where havens for the pirates abounded and the authority of the Spanish Empire – weakened by the Spanish struggle against Spains former colonies in Central America and South America – proved almost non-existent.

Undoubtedly, Terrier participated in many of the small expeditions and skirmishes of the squadron, but there is only one documented instance of her capturing a prize. That event occurred early in 1824, when she succeeded in retaking a French ship which had been seized by pirates. Unfortunately, the pirate crew escaped ashore to Spanish territory, a refuge into which Americans could not legally pursue them. Terrier operated in the West Indies until 1825.

Disposal
In 1825, a slackening in seaborne piracy enabled the U.S. Navy to begin disposing of its special-purpose, shallow-draft ships on the West Indies station. Terrier was one of the ships sold – presumably at auction – during 1825.

The plot follows a young Italian woman Clementina's marriage to Rinaldo despite her father's opposition to the wedding as he had wished her to marry Palermo. It ends with Palmero killing Rinaldo, and Clementina committing suicide in her despair.

In the History of Drama Allardyce Nicoll describes it as ""a poor dull pseudo-classic production, in spite of its Italian scene"". The original cast included Mary Ann Yates as Clementina, Robert Bensley as Granville and Richard Wroughton as Palermo.

58,41,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type3,", released in Europe and North America as Bells & Whistles, is a 1991 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and released by Konami. It is the fifth entry in the TwinBee series and the second to be released for arcades following the original TwinBee (previous sequels were released directly to home consoles). Set several years after the events of TwinBee, players assume the role of Light and Pastel (marking their debut appearance) taking control of TwinBee and WinBee to defeat invading forces of the evil alien Iva and save planet Meru after receiving an SOS message sent by princess Melora.

Detana!! TwinBee marked the debut of Japanese animator Shūjirō Hamakawa (credited under the pen name Shuzilow.Ha) as primary character designer for subsequent installments of the TwinBee series. The game proved popular among Japanese arcade players, earning several awards from Gamest magazine, while its ports to other platforms were also met with positive response from critics. A direct follow-up, Pop'n TwinBee, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.

Gameplay 

Detana!! TwinBee is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game following the same conventions established in the original TwinBee, where players assume the role of Light and Pastel (whose names are given in the audio drama TwinBee Paradise) taking control of TwinBee (P1) and WinBee (P2) across seven levels to defeat invading forces of the evil alien Iva and save planet Meru after receiving an SOS message sent by princess Melora.

The control configuration differs between regions; in the Japanese version, one button is used to fire the gun at airborne enemies while the other is used to drop bombs to the ground, while both buttons are used to do shoot and drop bombs at the same time in the European version. Holding down the shot button will cause a power-meter at the bottom of the screen to fill up, allowing the player to fire a ""Big Shot"" attack when releasing the button. Power-up items consist of bells which can be uncovered by shooting the floating clouds, as well as items uncovered by destroying land enemies. As with TwinBee, players can shoot the floating bells to change their colors. Besides the five different colors from the original TwinBee (yellow, white, blue, green, and red), two new bells are introduced: a purple bell that provides a ""tail shield"", activating barriers around the player's ship and a black bell that decreases speed of the ship.

Mini-bells and the lucky star from the first TwinBee return as well. GwinBee, a ship similar to TwinBee and WinBee also appears, allowing players to combine their ship with GwinBee to fire wider fire beams. Two players can also align their ships side by side to achieve the same effect or align their ships vertically for a powerful five-way spread. If both players align their ships with GwinBee between them, he will spring out and destroy all on-screen enemies. After the first loop is completed, players can replay it for a harder second loop. The game will be entirely over if the final stage is cleared again, but running out of lives results in a game over unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue and receive a ""free"" power-up.

Development 
Detana!! TwinBee was created by most of the same team that worked on several projects at Konami such as the Gradius series, with director Masato Ohsawa leading its development and Toru Shimomura served as sole programmer of the game while Hiroshi Matsuura also served as engineer. Ryouhei Shogaki, Hiroyuki Ashida and K. Ishimoto acted as co-designers. The title marked the debut of Japanese animator Shūjirō Hamakawa (credited under the pseudonym Shuzilow.Ha) in his first project as game designer, serving as character illustrator for subsequent installments of the TwinBee series. Konami Kukeiha Club members Hidenori Maezawa, Masae Nakashima and Michiru Yamane scored the soundtrack. Yamane stated she wrote the music as colorful and fun to match the ""cute bee world"" of the project.

Release 

Detana!! TwinBee was first released by Konami for arcades in Japan on February 1991 and Europe on March 1991 as Bells & Whistles. The game was first ported to the X68000 computer on December 6, 1991. The title was then ported to the PC Engine on February 28, 1992. This conversion is notable for being one of the earliest works of Koji Igarashi at Konami, serving as enemy programmer. On September 29, 1995, it was included as part of the Detana TwinBee Yahho! Deluxe Pack compilation for Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

Detana!! TwinBee was later ported to Japanese mobile phone platforms such as EZweb, i-mode and Yahoo Mobile on July 13, 2004. On January 25, 2007, the game was included as part of the TwinBee Portable collection for PlayStation Portable and later re-released as a budget title under the ""Konami The Best"" line on March 13, 2008. The PC Engine conversion was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console as a ""Hanabi Festival"" launch in Japan on September 18, 2007, then in North America on March 23, 2009 and later in PAL territories on July 24 of the same year. The PC Engine version was then re-released for the PlayStation Network as part of the ""PC Engine Archives"" line in Japan on June 16, 2010. On November 24, 2010, the arcade original was included on the Game Room gaming service for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 as part of ""Game Pack 012"". The PC Engine port was later added to the PC Engine GameBox app for iOS in Japan on February 12, 2014. In addition, the PC Engine version was also re-released in Japan for Windows through D4 Enterprise's Project EGG digital service on March 3, 2014.

Detana!! TwinBee was re-released in its PC Engine form between April and May 2014 across cloud gaming services like Smart TV Box, G-cluster and Hikari TV. The PC Engine conversion was eventually re-released only in Japan for the Wii Us Virtual Console on November 24, 2014. Hamster Corporation later re-released the arcade version for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on January 16, 2020 under their Arcade Archives series.

Reception and legacy 

In Japan, Game Machine listed Detana!! TwinBee on their March 15, 1991 issue as being the third most-popular arcade game at the time. Both Martin Gaksch and Heinrich Lenhardt of German magazine Power Play regarded the game to be a nice vertical-scrolling shooter with enjoyable candy-colored visuals. In the May 1991 issue of Japanese publication Micom BASIC Magazine, the game was ranked on the number six spot in popularity. Maurizio Miccoli of Italian magazine Computer+Videogiochi gave the title a positive outlook. Gamest gave it several awards for the 5th Gamest Grand Prize (1991), winning 3rd place in the Grand Prize, 1st place in the Best Shooting Award, 4th place in the Best Graphic Award, 3rd place in the Best VGM Award, 5th place in Player Popularity and 8th place in the Annual Hit Game. Nishikawa Zenji of Japanese magazine Oh!X applauded the X68000 conversion for its arcade-accurate graphics and sound, among other aspects. This version also proved popular among the X68000 userbase, eventually being nominated for a ""Game of the Year"" award by Oh!X but losing against other titles such as Parodius Da!.

The PC Engine port received positive reception from critics who reviewed it as an import title. Public reception was also positive: readers of PC Engine Fan voted to give Detana!! TwinBee a 24.79 out of 30 score, ranking at the number 19 spot in a poll, indicating a large popular following. Both Kaneda Kun and François Hermellin of Consoles + praised the PC Engine conversion for its colorful graphics, sympathetic music and impeccable gameplay but criticized the presentation. Four reviewers of Famitsu gave the PC Engine version a score of 24 out of 40. Computer and Video Gamess Frank O'Connor commended the PC Engine port for its arcade-accurate presentation and gameplay but criticized the music for being annoying. AllGames Kyle Knight gave positive remarks to the imaginative boss designs and enjoyable gameplay but noted the audio design to be a mixed point on the PC Engine release. Olivier Prézeau of Joypad and Joysticks Jean-Marc Demoly praised the PC Engine port for its graphics, sound and controls as well.

Reviewing the Virtual Console re-release, Nintendo Lifes Corbie Dillard praised its responsive controls, arcade-accurate visuals and upbeat soundtrack. IGNs Lucas M. Thomas commended its anime-inspired world and co-op play feature. Eurogamers Dan Whitehead compared it with Xevious, stating it was not as good as MUSHA nor as cute as Fantasy Zone but regarded it as an appealing vertical-scrolling shooter for casual players.

A clone of Detana!! TwinBee for the Amiga titled Gunbee F-99 was published as a covermount alongside the December 1998 issue of Amiga Format magazine.

A pre-series set was delivered in June 2010 for extensive testing, with 23 full-production sets delivered between November 2012 and spring 2014.

Operations
The 7-car E6 series trains operate in conjunction with E5 series or H5 series (since March 2016) 10-car trains, initially on just four return services daily from 16 March 2013. They replaced all of the previous E3 series trains on Komachi services by 15 March 2014.

Design
Technology incorporated in these trains is derived from the experimental Fastech 360Z train previously tested by JR East. The E6 series trains are formed of seven cars, to provide the same seating capacity as six-car E3 series trains, due to the reduced seating capacity in the end cars. All cars feature active suspension with tilting up to 1.5 degrees.

Formation

Pre-production set S12
The pre-series train, numbered ""S12"" (later becoming ""Z1""), was formed as follows, with car 11 at the Tokyo end and car 17 at the Morioka end.

 Car 11 provides Green (first class) accommodation.
 Cars 12 and 16 are each fitted with a single-arm pantograph. Like the E5 series, only one pantograph is normally used in service.
 Cars 11 to 14 were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and cars 15 to 17 were built by Hitachi.

Full-production sets Z2–
The full-production trains, numbered ""Z2"" onward, are formed as follows, with car 11 at the Tokyo end and car 17 at the Morioka end.

 Car 11 provides Green (first class) accommodation.
 Cars 12 and 16 are each fitted with a single-arm pantograph.

Exterior
The overall styling was overseen by Japanese industrial designer Ken Okuyama, and is intended to evoke images of the Namahage demons and kantō festival lanterns for which Akita Prefecture is famous. The main body colour is  white with crimson roof and ""arrow silver"" bodyside stripe. The end cars are  long with the tapered nose accounting for approximately 13 m (compared with approximately 6 m for the E3 series).

Interior
The new trains feature similar improvements to passenger accommodation as featured on the E5 series trains, including AC power outlets, and security cameras in vestibule areas. Seating in both Standard class and Green (first class) cars is in the standard 2+2 arrangement for mini-shinkansen trains. Seat pitch is  in Green class and  in Standard class, the same as for the E3 series trains. Cars 12, 13, 14, and 16 are equipped with toilets. The toilet in car 12 is universal access.

History

The pre-series set, S12, was delivered to Sendai Depot in June 2010, and formally accepted by JR East on 8 July. Test running commenced on the Tohoku Shinkansen in July 2010.

The first full-production set was delivered in November 2012, with production continuing until spring 2014.

Revenue service commenced on 16 March 2013 on new Super Komachi services, running at a maximum speed of  on the Tohoku Shinkansen. From 15 March 2014, the maximum speed was raised to  on the Tohoku Shinkansen, with the maximum speed on the Akita Shinkansen tracks remaining at , allowing journey times between Tokyo and Akita to be reduced by an average of 12 minutes. The service name was also returned to simply Komachi.

In May 2014, the E6 series was awarded the 2014 Laurel Prize, presented annually by the Japan Railfan Club. The award presentation ceremony was held at Akita Station on 8 November 2014.

Fleet list

, 24 sets were in service, as shown below.

While the first sets from both Hitachi and Kawasaki Heavy Industries were delivered by sea to Sendai, set Z9 was delivered from the Kawasaki Heavy Industries factory in Kobe by rail to Akita Depot over three days from 31 May to 2 June 2013, mounted on temporary narrow-gauge (1,067 mm gauge) bogies and hauled by freight locomotives. This was followed by set Z11 from 21 to 23 June 2013.

2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships
2010 in women's swimmingFort Fetterman was constructed in 1867 by the United States Army on the Great Plains frontier in Dakota Territory, approximately 11 miles northwest of present-day Douglas, Wyoming. Located high on the bluffs south of the North Platte River, it served as a major base for the start of several United States military expeditions against warring Native American tribes. The fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History
Fort Fetterman was built as a major supply point for the United States army's operations in the area. Established on July 19, 1867, by Companies A, C, H, and I of the 4th U.S. Infantry under the command of Major William E. Dye, the fort was named in honor of Captain William J. Fetterman, who was killed in a battle with Indians near Fort Phil Kearny on December 21, 1866.

""It contained quarters for three hundred enlisted men, and the necessary officers; the various magazines and store-houses required for the preservation of ammunition, rations and other supplies; a hospital with fifteen beds; stables for fifty horses; a corral capable of holding fifty-six mule wagons, with their animals; a theatre, an ice-house, a root-house, a granary, a bake-house, blacksmith shops, saw-mill, saddlers' shop, paint shop, laundresses' quarters and a steam engine for pumping water from the North Platte River.""

With the completion of Fort Fetterman, the army abandoned Fort Caspar and moved its garrison into the new fort in August.  As it was on the south side of the Platte, Fort Fetterman was excluded from the provisions of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which resulted in the US abandonment of all forts further to the north: forts Reno, Phil Kearny, and C.F. Smith). Thus, Fort Fetterman became the northernmost military post in eastern Wyoming.  It was important to the protection of the Bozeman Trail and other routes for settlers.

Given its remote location, the post was not considered a desirable station. Desertions by soldiers were frequent, and the winters long and hard.  Supplies had to be brought in by wagon from Fort Laramie to the southeast or from Medicine Bow Station on the railroad.  Soldiers had to carry water up the steep bluffs from the river or nearby creek.  The soil proved to be unsuitable for sustaining gardens, so fresh vegetables were not available.

In 1876, during the Great Sioux War with the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes, the monotony of garrison duty at Fetterman was broken by a series of major military expeditions that set out from the fort. The Big Horn Expedition, which included three of the post's four companies under the command of Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds, culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Powder River in March. The Yellowstone Expedition led by Brigadier General George Crook engaged in the Battle of Rosebud in June, and the Powder River Expedition under Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie destroyed a Cheyenne village in November during the Dull Knife Fight. Fort Fetterman remained active until 1882, when it was abandoned by the Army as the Indian Wars had subsided.

A small community (Fetterman City) was started around the empty fort by Charles Henry King and others as an outfitting point for area ranchers and for wagon trains.  When the town of Douglas was established eleven miles away in 1886, Fetterman City rapidly declined.

State Historic Site
The old fort deteriorated from neglect. Today, the partially restored site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is administered as an historic site by the State of Wyoming.  Visitors can walk an interpretive trail to view the ruins of the fort's buildings.  An officers' quarters and an ordnance warehouse have been restored and contain exhibits, artifacts and dioramas about the fort's history, Fetterman City and area Native Americans.

Three days later, on September 28, Kim hit a 2-run home run in the ninth inning of a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. The Orioles were facing a 2–1 deficit at the time and Kim hit the go ahead, game-winning home run on the ninth pitch of his at-bat. The Orioles would go on to win the game 3–2.

International career

In August 2008, Kim competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2008 Olympic Games, where they won the gold medal in the baseball tournament. In the preliminary round game against Japan, Kim hit a go-ahead RBI single in the top of the ninth off closer Iwase Hitoki to break a 2–2 tie as a pinch hitter, leading South Korea to a 5–3 win over Japan.

In March 2009, Kim competed for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, where they finished runner-up with a 6–3 record. In the tournament, he went 11-for-28 (.393) with 4 RBIs, 6 runs and 7 walks, and was named to the All-Star team at designated hitter. He played for Korea again in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, going 3 for 12 in Korea's three games.

The wingspan is 2.8-4.6 mm. Late instar larvae have been found in the middle of June and latter part of July and October in Cincinnati. Adults have been collected in May and late June to the middle of July, indicating that there are at least two and possibly three generations per year.

The larvae feed on Rubus species, including Rubus occidentalis. They mine the leaves of their host plant.  The mine is a long, very narrow, serpentine tract on the upper surface of the leaf. The frass is deposited centrally as a dense black line becoming more diffuse in the distal fifth of the mine.

Discography

Pop music discographies
Rhythm and blues discographiesHMS Charlotte was a mercantile schooner that Royal Navy hired or chartered in 1796 (or earlier), purchased in 1797 and commissioned in 1798. In her brief military career in the Caribbean she captured two small enemy privateers before she herself fell prey to a French privateer. The British recaptured her a little more than a year later but then broke her up in 1799 rather than recommissioning her.

Cruising
The Royal Navy armed Charlotte with eight 6-pounder guns and gave her a crew of 60 men. There are no records of any of her dimensions. She was commissioned under Lieutenant John Williams. A letter from Commander James Athol Wood of  reporting on the recapture of a vessel on 9 March 1796, states that he put ""The Officers on Board the Charlotte Sloop, Lieutenant Williams..."".

On 29 May 1797 Charlotte captured the French schooner Mort, off Dominica. Mort was armed with four guns and had a crew of 36 men. She had not made any captures since leaving Guadeloupe.

On 9 September Charlotte  captured the Dutch privateer Esle Andeneming, of Surinam. Esle Andeneming was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 38 men. She was provisioned for a three-month cruise and was nineteen days out, not having captured anything, when Charlotte captured her off the Demerary river.

Capture
Lieutenant John Thicknesse replaced Williams. Shortly thereafter, on 16 October 1798 the French 14-gun privateer Enfant Prodigue captured Charlotte off Cap Français or Cape François, Hispaniola. Charlotte suffered one man wounded before she struck her colours. A second, smaller schooner and two large armed launches supported Enfant Prodigue in the attack on Charlotte, which suffered considerable damage. Her main boom topping lift and all the braces had been shot away. One gun had been dismounted and two others disabled by broken breeches, leaving her with only five guns to continue the action. Surrounded by the enemy and unable to manoeuvre, Thicknesse was forced to surrender. Charlottes low casualty rate was a consequence of the French tactic of firing high to disable rigging. The subsequent court-martial honourably acquitted Thicknesse of the loss.

Recapture
The French Navy took her into service as Vengeur. However, on 24 November 1799,  recaptured her and three other armed vessels as well, off Cape Triburon as the four French vessels were becalmed while on their way from Cape François to Jacquemel. Vengeur was armed with eight brass 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 91 men.  shared in the capture.

Fate
The Royal Navy chose to break up Charlotte/Vengeur rather than recommission her.

History
In the early years, some of the most popular products were Simtel shareware for MS-DOS, CICA Shareware for Microsoft Windows, and the Aminet archives for the Amiga. In January 1994, it published a collection of 350 texts from Project Gutenberg, one of the first published ebook collections.

Walnut Creek developed a close relationship with the FreeBSD Unix-like open source operating system project from its inception in 1993. The company published FreeBSD on CD-ROM, distributed it by FTP, employed FreeBSD project founders Jordan Hubbard and David Greenman, ran FreeBSD on its servers, sponsored FreeBSD conferences, and published FreeBSD books, including The Complete FreeBSD. By 1997, FreeBSD was Walnut Creek's ""most successful product"", according to Bruce. From 1995 onwards, Walnut Creek was also the official publisher of Slackware Linux. Walnut Creek also gained fame for its idgames subdirectory, which was the de facto distribution center for the Doom-engine modification community at the time.

As more users gained access to high-speed Internet connections, demand for software on physical media decreased dramatically. The company merged with Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDI) in 2000 to focus more engineering effort on the similar FreeBSD and BSD/OS operating systems. Soon after, BSDI acquired Telenet System Solutions, Inc., an Internet infrastructure server supplier.

The software assets of BSDI (FreeBSD, Slackware, BSD/OS) were acquired by Wind River Systems in 2001, and the remainder of the company renamed itself iXsystems. Wind River dropped sponsorship of Slackware soon afterwards, while the FreeBSD unit was divested as a separate entity in 2002 as FreeBSD Mall, Inc. Also, the idgames and related archives moved to 3D Gamers in October 2001.

iXsystems' server business was acquired in 2002 by Offmyserver, which reverted to the iXsystems name in 2005. In February 2007, iXsystems acquired FreeBSD Mall.

Namesake
LeRoy Fitch was born on 1 October 1835 in Logansport, Indiana. He was a member of the United States Naval Academy class of 1856, and served with distinction in the American Civil War and afterward. Commanding  in the Mississippi Squadron, in 1863 he pursued General John Hunt Morgan, CSA, the famed raider, for  up the Ohio River, frustrating Morgan's attempts to cross the river and retire to Confederate territory. Commander Fitch died in Logansport, Indiana on 13 April 1875.

Construction and commissioning
Fitch was launched on 14 June 1941 by Boston Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. H. W. Thomas, grandniece of Commander Fitch. The ship was commissioned on 3 February 1942. She was reclassified DMS-25 on 15 November 1944, and again classified DD-462 on 15 July 1955.

Service history
Fitchs first mission, from 1 July to 5 August 1942, was to escort the aircraft carrier  to a point off the Gold Coast, where the carrier flew off United States Army Air Forces planes for Accra. The destroyer returned to Norfolk on 5 August for exercises in preparation for the assault on North Africa, for which she sailed from Bermuda 25 October. Screening Ranger and two escort carriers, Fitch took part in the landings at Fedhala, French Morocco, on 8 November, and guarded the carriers as they flew Army planes off to the captured airfield at Port Lyautey. Returning to Norfolk 24 November, Fitch joined in exercises in Casco and Chesapeake Bays, and performed coastal escort duty, sailing as far south as the Panama Canal Zone, through the remainder of 1942.

On 8 January 1943, Fitch cleared Norfolk with Ranger on the first of two voyages to launch aircraft to North African bases. Operations with Ranger completed, Fitch served on patrol out of NS Argentia, Newfoundland, from 6 April to 12 May, then sailed to Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, Scotland, to join the British Home Fleet for patrol duty between that base and Iceland. She served on this duty through the summer, protecting northern convoys, then returned to Norfolk on 9 August.

Sailing on 2 September 1943 to escort a convoy to Derry, Northern Ireland, Fitch continued to Thurso Bay, where on 20 September she embarked Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox and Admiral Harold R. Stark for transportation to Scapa Flow. Operating out of Scapa Flow for the next two months, Fitch screened Ranger as her planes attacked German forces and installations near Bodø, Norway, on 4 October, and patrolled off Spitzbergen as the men of the weather station there were relieved and resupplied.

Fitch returned to Boston 3 December 1943 to resume coastal and Caribbean escort duty and to take part in hunter-killer operations in the western Atlantic until 25 April 1944, when she got underway from Norfolk for Belfast, Northern Ireland. In the great buildup for the Normandy invasion, Fitch escorted single ships and convoys between Belfast and Plymouth, England, and took part in training exercises until 6 June, when
she sailed from Plymouth for the assault.

Arriving off Utah Beach early in the morning of the invasion, Fitch followed the minesweepers through the newly swept channels to within 2,000 yards of the coast. Her mission was to draw out and silence German batteries prior to the landings. In addition to her effective gunfire, Fitch rescued the survivors of , keeping up her fire at the shore batteries as she did so. After two days screening the transport area, she returned to Plymouth for supplies, then continued to give fire support and to patrol off the beachheads until 19 June. Convoy escort duty around the British Isles was her assignment until 4 July, when she sailed from Belfast for Oran, and exercises in the western Mediterranean.

Fitch sortied from Taranto, Italy, 11 August 1944 for the invasion of Southern France on 15 August, during which she spotted the fire of  as well as firing in the prelanding bombardment. Until 25 October, she supported the buildup in southern France by escorting convoys moving between Naples, Palermo, Oran, Gibraltar, and Marseilles. Between her return to Norfolk on 10 November and 3 January 1945, when she sailed for the Pacific, Fitch was converted to a high-speed minesweeper and was redesignated DMS-25.

Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 10 February 1945, Fitch trained in minesweeping exercises there and at Ulithi, where her propellers were badly damaged when she ran afoul of a coral pinnacle. Repairs were made at Pearl Harbor from 10 April to 6 August, when she sailed to join the 3rd Fleet off Japan. Fitch began sweeping the entrance to Tokyo Bay on 28 August, and was present for the surrender ceremonies on 2 September. She continued to sweep off Japan and in the East China Sea until returning to San Diego on 23 December.

On 9 January 1946, Fitch arrived at Norfolk, where she was immobilized for a month. She voyaged between Norfolk, Charleston, and New York transferring minesweeper crews for several months, and in November, from her home port at Charleston, began regular operations training Mine Force officers, exercising in the Caribbean and along the east coast, and cruising to the Mediterranean in 1949, 1951, and 1953. During 1955, she conducted tests in the Caribbean for the Operational Development Force. Fitch was decommissioned at Charleston 24 February 1956 and placed in reserve.

Awards
Fitch received five battle stars for her World War II service.

NGC objects 2001-3000A tarantula hawk is a spider wasp (Pompilidae) that preys on tarantulas. Tarantula hawks belong to any of the many species in the genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis. They are one of the largest parasitoid wasps, using their sting to paralyze their prey before dragging it to a brood nest as living food; a single egg is laid on the prey, hatching to a larva which eats the still-living prey.

Description
Common species are up to 5 cm (2 in) long, making them among the largest of wasps, and have blue-black bodies and bright, rust-colored wings (other species have black wings with blue highlights). The vivid coloration found on their bodies, and especially wings, is an aposematism, advertising to potential predators the wasps' ability to deliver a powerful sting. Their long legs have hooked claws for grappling with their victims. The stinger of a female Pepsis grossa can be up to  long, and the powerful sting is considered one of the most painful insect stings in the world.

Behavior
The female tarantula hawk wasp stings a tarantula between the legs, paralyzes it, then drags the prey to a specially prepared burrow, where a single egg is laid on the spider's abdomen, and the burrow entrance is covered. Sex of the larvae is determined by fertilization; fertilized eggs produce females, while unfertilized eggs produce males. When the wasp larva hatches, it creates a small hole in the spider's abdomen, then enters and feeds voraciously, avoiding vital organs for as long as possible to keep the spider alive. After several weeks, the larva pupates. Finally, the wasp becomes an adult and emerges from the spider's abdomen to continue the life cycle.

Adult tarantula hawks are nectarivorous. The consumption of fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates them to the point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in the daytime in summer, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt. Both males and females feed on the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees. Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. The males can become resident defenders of the favorable reproduction spots for hours into the afternoon. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.

Distribution
Worldwide distribution of tarantula hawks includes areas from India to Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Tarantula hawk species have been observed from as far north as Logan, Utah and south as far as Argentina, with at least 250 species living in South America. Eighteen species of Pepsis and three species of Hemipepsis are found in the United States, primarily in the deserts of the southwestern United States, with Pepsis grossa (formerly Pepsis formosa) and Pepsis thisbe being common. The two species are difficult to distinguish, but the majority of P. grossa have metallic blue bodies and reddish antennae, which separates them from P. thisbe. Both species have bright orange wings that become transparent near the tip.

Sting
Tarantula hawk wasps are relatively docile and rarely sting without provocation. However, the sting—particularly that of P. grossa—is among the most painful of all insects, though the intense pain only lasts about five minutes. One researcher described the pain as ""...immediate, excruciating, unrelenting pain that simply shuts down one's ability to do anything, except scream. Mental discipline simply does not work in these situations."" In terms of scale, the wasp's sting is rated near the top of the Schmidt sting pain index, second only to that of the bullet ant, and is described by Schmidt as ""blinding, fierce[, and] shockingly electric"". Because of their extremely large stingers, very few animals are able to eat them; one of the few that can is the roadrunner. Many predatory animals avoid these wasps, and many different insects mimic them, including various other wasps and bees (Müllerian mimics), as well as moths, flies (e.g., mydas flies), and beetles (e.g., Tragidion) (Batesian mimics).

Aside from the possibility of triggering an allergic reaction, the sting is not dangerous and does not require medical attention. Local redness appears in most cases after the pain, and lasts for up to a week.

State insect of New Mexico
The U.S. state of New Mexico chose a species of tarantula hawk (specifically, P. formosa, now known as P. grossa) in 1989 to become its official state insect. Its selection was prompted by a group of elementary school children from Edgewood doing research on states that had adopted state insects. They selected three insects as candidates and mailed ballots to all schools for a statewide election. The winner was the tarantula hawk wasp.

League summary

League table
With the season not being fully completed, a points per game formula was subsequently used to determine the final standings, with Kelty Hearts declared champions on 13 April. Only two teams' league positions were changed as a result; with BSC Glasgow's 2.32 points average moving them past the 2.04 of East Stirlingshire for third place.

Positions by round
The table lists the positions of teams after each round of matches. In order to preserve chronological progress, any postponed matches are not included in the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. For example, if a match is scheduled for matchday 13, but then postponed and played between days 16 and 17, it will be added to the standings for day 16.

ScotlandWilliam Owtram D.D. (17 March, 1626 – 23 August, 1679) was a clergyman who published notable theological works. After leading the church of the House of Commons, St. Margaret's, Westminster, he gained preferment as Archdeacon of Leicester.

Life
Son of Robert Owtram, he was born at Barlow, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire, on 17 March 1625–6. On 13 May 1642 he was admitted a sizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1646. He was afterwards elected to a fellowship at Christ's College, where he graduated M.A. in 1649. In 1655 he held the university office of junior proctor, and in 1662 he was created D.D. His first church preferment was in Lincolnshire, and he subsequently obtained the rectory of St. Mary Woolnoth, London, which he resigned in 1666. In 1664 he was also Minister, but not Rector, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. He stayed in London during the plague in 1665 On 30 July 1669 he was installed Archdeacon of Leicester. On 30 July 1670 he was installed prebendary of Westminster.

Death
Owtram died on 23 August 1679, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument, with a Latin inscription, was erected to his memory. His will, dated 5 November 1677, was proved in London 3 September 1679  He bequeathed lands in Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, and left legacies to the children of his brother Francis Owtram, deceased, and of his sisters Barbara Burley and Mary Sprenthall, both deceased, and Jane Stanley, then living.

An elaborate catalogue of his library was compiled by William Cooper, London, 1681, 4to. Owtram's widow lived forty-two years after him, until 4 October 1721

Owtram was a nervous and accurate writer. and an excellent preacher, and he was reputed to have extraordinary skill in rabbinical learning.

Major works
His principal work is De Sacrificiis libri duo; quorum altero explicantur omnia Judaeorum, nonnulla Gentium Profanarum Sacrificia; altero Sacrificium Christi. Utroque Ecclesiae Catholicae his de rebus Sententia contra Faustum Socinum, ejusque sectatores defenditur, London, 1677, 4to, dedicated to Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby. An English translation, entitled 'Two Dissertations on Sacrifices,' with additional notes and indexes by John Allen, was published in 1817. 
After his death Joseph Hindmarsh published under his name six Sermons upon Faith and Providence, and other subjects, London, 1680, but they are not genuine. 

In order to do justice to his memory, his relatives caused Twenty Sermons preached upon several occasions to be published from the author's own copies, by James Gardiner, D.D., afterwards Bishop of Lincoln (2nd ed., London, 1697.

88,56,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type1,"In aviation, a multiplane is a fixed-wing aircraft-configuration featuring multiple wing planes. The wing planes may be stacked one above another, or one behind another, or both in combination.
Types having a small number of planes have specific names and are not usually described as multiplanes:

 Biplane - two wings stacked one above the other
 Triplane - three wings stacked one above another
 Tandem wing - two main planes, one behind the other. The tandem triple or tandem triplet configuration has three lifting surfaces one behind another.

While triplane, quadruplane and tandem designs are relatively uncommon, aircraft with more than four sets of wings rarely occur - none have proven successful.

Quadruplanes

The quadruplane configuration takes the triplane approach a step further, using efficient wings of high aspect ratio and stacking them to allow a compact and light weight design. During the pioneer years of aviation and World War I, a few designers sought these potential benefits for a variety of reasons, mostly with little success.

From ca. 1909 the American inventor Matthew Bacon Sellers II made a series of flights in the Sellers 1909 Quadruplane, progressively fitted with powerplants of decreasing power, in order to investigate low-powered flight. He eventually achieved flight on only 5 to 6 hp at a speed of 20 mph.

Pemberton-Billing Ltd. made two prototype Zeppelin killers, the Pemberton-Billing P.B.29E and Pemberton-Billing P.B.31E, respectively in 1915 and 1917. They were comparatively large, twin-engined fighters. After the company changed its name to Supermarine, the P.B.31E became known as the Supermarine Nighthawk.

Following test flights with the prototype Armstrong Whitworth F.K.9 in 1916, a small number of Armstrong Whitworth F.K.10 quadruplane reconnaissance fighters were produced, but none saw combat action.

The private-venture Wight Quadruplane scout fighter was flown in 1917.

The Euler Vierdecker of 1917 unusually featured a standard triplane arrangement of fixed wings with a fourth uppermost wing comprising left and right hand articulated surfaces which acted as full-span ailerons. Two examples were built, with different engines.

Also in 1917, Friedrichshafen created the even more unusual Friedrichshafen FF54 scout fighter, which featured narrow-chord second and third wings, with struts connecting only the upper pair and lower pair of planes. The prototype proved unacceptable in the air and was later modified as an equally unsuccessful triplane, again with a short-chord intermediate plane.

The Naglo D.II quadruplane fighter of 1918 featured a standard triplane arrangement with a smaller fourth wing attached below the main assembly, somewhat analogous to a sesquiplane. It participated in Germany's second D-type contest in 1918, and was praised for its construction and workmanship.

In 1922 Besson constructed the H-5, a prototype quadruplane flying boat transport. It was unusual in having two braced biplane wing stacks deeply staggered and vertically offset such that the four wing planes were stacked in an overall zig-zag arrangement. The only example was damaged and development was abandoned.

More than four planes

Any fixed-wing aircraft with more than four wing planes may be referred to as a multiplane. Planes may be stacked vertically as with a biplane, or placed one in front of another as with a tandem wing. Both principles may be combined.

Stacked multiplanes

In the 1890s Hiram Maxim constructed a steam-powered flying machine which he ran on rails as a test rig. It began as a biplane and later more lifting and control surfaces were added to create a bizarre multiplane. On one occasion the lift force was so great that the rail was damaged. Maxim did not allow the rig to take off because it had no effective controls.

Horatio Phillips built a series of multiplane types from 1904. His Phillips Multiplane I had 20 stacked wings in an otherwise fairly conventional layout. It proved too unstable for sustained flight. By 1907 his third model was able to fly 500 ft, achieving the first successful powered flight in Great Britain. However the disappointing performance compared to more conventional contemporary types caused Phillips to abandon his ideas.

In 1908 Roshon in America and D'Equevilly in France produced typical multiplane designs. The AEA Cygnet II, designed by Alexander Graham Bell and constructed by the Aerial Experimental Association in America, featured a cellular multiplane formed by hundreds of tetrahedral shapes. Neither of these was capable of flight.

One of the most infamous multiplanes was the 1923 Gerhardt Cycleplane, a human-powered aircraft with seven sets of wings which made a single short hop under human power alone.  Its flimsy construction and subsequent collapse was filmed, and this is often used as stock footage mocking early impractical aircraft designs.

Tandem multiplanes
The American Williams 1908 Multiplane featured four planes in tandem while the Zerbe Sextuplane of 1908 had six. The same year, in Switzerland the Dufaux 1908 Tandem Triplane provided the country's first native design in the form of a tandem pair of stacked triplane wings with a smaller biplane horizontal stabiliser.

Stacks in tandem
Anthony Fokker designed his bizarre Fokker V.8 about the same time as his famous Fokker Dr.I triplane. It featured a tandem arrangement of five wing planes, grouped as a stacked triplane fore wing and a biplane rear wing. Unlike its successful cousin, it barely flew and was soon abandoned.

As late as 1921, the Italian Gianni Caproni mated three stacks of triplane wings from his Caproni Ca.4 series to a single fuselage in tandem triple arrangement, to create the nine-winged Caproni Ca.60 Noviplano prototype long-range airliner. It proved unstable and crashed on its first flight.

Lists of aircraft by design configurationThe British School of Barcelona (BSB) is a private coeducational bilingual international school located in the Barcelona metropolitan area, Catalonia, Spain.

It's a high-performing, all-through British International school for students aged 3–18 with four campuses in Barcelona, Castelldefels and Sitges.

In October 2021, the school was graded as an 'Outstading School in every Category' following the BSO inspection as a British Schools Overseas run by the English Department for Education (DfE) of the British Government. In their report, the inspectors highlighted the quality of education, the strong sense of community among staff, students and families, and the global educational standards of the school. 

The school is formally recognised and accredited by the British government for teaching the English National Curriculum, and by the International Baccalaureate Organization to deliver the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP). The school is also authorised to validate the Spanish ESO and Bachillerato (Secondary and Sixth Form) by the Spanish Ministry of Education and the Catalan department of Education.

The British School of Barcelona has been a Cognita school since 2007.

The school is a founder member of the National Association of British Schools in Spain (NABSS).

History

 Founded in 1958 as the Anglo-American School. In 1978, the first Royal Decree recognizing foreign schools in Spain was published and studies were validated for Spanish pupils as well. The recognition of studies was an important factor in the growth of the school, as more families from the local area showed interest in British education and the learning of English, and the need for expansion became apparent.

 In 1999 The British School of Barcelona is founded.
 In 2007, the owners reached retirement age and transferred its ownership to the Cognita Schools Group.
 In January 2016 Cognita Group acquires International School of Barcelona, located in Sitges, and the school is integrated as a new campus under the brand of The British School of Barcelona as from September 2016.
 April 2018 sees the opening of BSB Nexus, the new Pre-University campus of The British School of Barcelona in Castelldefels, a purpose-built, three-storey centre.
 In September 2019 the school expands its sports facilities with a new 9,000 sqm rugby and football stadium adjacent to the BSB Castelldefels campus.
 In 2021 BSB announces the opening of a new campus in the city of Barcelona. The new BSB City campus will become the fourth campus of The British School of Barcelona. The BSB City Foundation campus will open in September 2021 for Early Years and Primary children. BSB City will then expand to Secondary and Pre-University students in September 2023.
 September 2021 will also see the opening of a new state-of-the-art BSB Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Centre in Castelldefels opposite the BSB Nexus campus. This Centre will expand existing lab space and facilitate innovative and flexible teaching methods for Secondary and Pre-University students.

The British School of Barcelona is considered one of the most important international schools in Spain (El Mundo, Best Schools in Spain).

Facilities 

The school has campuses in Barcelona, Castelldefels and Sitges. It serves children from the city and surrounding areas. 

BSB Sitges: From Nursery to Year 6 (3-11 years old) 
 BSB Castelldefels: From Nursery to Year 11 (3-16 years old)
 BSB Nexus, in Castelldefels: Pre-University campus for students in Years 12 and 13 (16-18 years old)
BSB City, in Barcelona: From Nursery to Pre-University (3-18 years old)

All four campuses ofter purpose-built buildings and sports facilities, such as spacious classrooms, library and resources centres, Science laboratories, Information Technology rooms, Music and practise rooms, indoor gymnasium, outdoor multi-sports courts, a multi-game artificial turf pitch, a theatre/auditorium. Swimming takes place at the sports centres next door (such as Gran Via Mar and Club Natació Sitges). 

The school also has exceptional purpose-built facilities, such as a 9,000 sqm rugby and football stadium adjacent to the BSB Castelldefels campus and a new state-of-the-art BSB STEM Centre (for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), which opened its doors in October 2021 in Castelldefels. This Centre facilitates innovative and flexible teaching methods for Secondary and Pre-University students.

School organisation and studies 

The British School of Barcelona educates children from Nursery school age (3 years old) to University entrance (18 years old).

Studies at the school mainly follow the National Curriculum of England and Wales. Pupils at the school then study for GCSE examinations and, as they enter Pre-University education, can then choose between Advanced Level examinations (A Levels) or the International Baccalaureate (IB Diploma Programme (DP). Both programmes share a core curriculum of subjects that all students take.

The Pre-University curriculum also ensures that students can fulfil the requirements of the Spanish and Catalan Governments so that they can achieve the Spanish qualifications (ESO and Bachillerato) if they complete the relevant courses and assessments throughout Secondary and Pre-University.

In addition, the school also prepares the students to take the Spanish University Access exams (PCE or Pruebas de Competencias Específicas) to access Spanish universities, which is organised by the UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia).

14,57,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type2,"WCRO is an American radio station, operating at 1230 AM in Johnstown, Pennsylvania broadcasting a soft adult contemporary format.  The station is owned by the Greater Johnstown School District and is operated by Lightner Communications out of Altoona, Pennsylvania.  WCRO broadcasts at the federally assigned frequency of 1230 kHz, with a full-time power of 1,000 watts.

History
WCRO has the distinction of retaining the same call letters since first going on the air in September 1947, and that it has never had a sister FM station co-located with it.  The application was first filed on July 29, 1946, with a construction permit granted on December 11, 1946.

WCRO's first owner was Century Broadcasting Corporation, headed by John Keel.  John Hanssen served as the station's first general manager.  The station operated then at a power of 250 Watts, and was an affiliate of the ABC radio network.  Studios were located at 317 Main Street in downtown Johnstown but were moved in 1952 to the Fort Stanwix Hotel at 332 Main Street.  In 1961, the station was granted permission to raise its daytime power output from 250 watts to 1,000 watts, three years after initially applying for a frequency change from 1230 kHz to 850 kHz.  The latter frequency would later be adopted by WJAC (now WKGE).

The station moved in 1966 from the Ft. Stanwix Hotel to the second floor of the Carnegie Building at the corner of Main and Clinton Streets in Johnstown. Eleven years later, Century Broadcasting Corporation changed the name of the licensee to Century Broadcasting of Pennsylvania.

In March 1984, Century Broadcasting, after more than 37 years of ownership, sold WCRO to Hamilton Communications, a company headed by Robert Hamilton.  Doris Lichtenfels took over as general manager after Sandy D. Neri left to join WJAC-AM/FM, the latter being newly rechristened as WKYE ""Key 95"", in September 1983.  Studios were then moved to 407 Main Street.

By this time, WCRO had gone into a decline, largely because of the collapse of Johnstown's lucrative coal and steel industries, resulting in a domino effect to the local retail economy.  Hamilton Communications responded by selling WCRO to Tschudy Communications in August 1989.

Shortly after Tschudy's takeover, WCRO's full-time airstaff was laid off and replaced with ABC/SMN's ""Starstation"" adult contemporary format (known today as ""Hits and Favorites"") also used by neighboring stations WCCS and WOKW.  Though the reduced operating costs did help the station's fortunes somewhat, a sale from then-owner Tschudy Communications was inevitable to keep the station from falling into bankruptcy.

WCRO was sold in February 1991 from Tschudy Communications to J. Richard Lee, who formed the Eagle Radio Network, making WCRO its flagship station.  Lee had purchased two other AM stations north of Johnstown that had recently gone dark and their studios vacated and assets liquidated through bankruptcy proceedings.  Because those stations, WNCC and WRDD, no longer had separate studio buildings or facilities of their own other than their tower sites, they became repeaters for WCRO.

WCRO and Eagle Radio Network operations then moved to 616 Main Street.

Eagle Radio operated with a format of time-brokered Christian Talk and teaching and had been successful for about four years until the FCC approved a series of applications for FM translators and power increases for Christian-formatted competitors on that band.  Faced with the prospect of being squeezed out of business by its FM counterparts, Eagle Radio put all three stations up for sale in the mid-1990s.

WNCC and WRDD were sold in February 1997 to Vernal Enterprises of Indiana, Pennsylvania, which owned WTYM and low-powered television station WLLS-LP.  A new facility for both WNCC and WRDD was built in WNCC's city of license in Northern Cambria and full-service local programming resumed on those stations.

Vernal Enterprises declined an offer to purchase WCRO, which was then sold to the Greater Johnstown School District in January 1999 for $80,000.  The station then moved out of its dilapidated building on Main Street and onto the high school campus at 222 Central Avenue, with all new digital, state-of-the-art equipment.  Ralph Osmolinski, the district's Technology Coordinator, took over as general manager.  Not long after WCRO's sale to Greater Johnstown School District, the station adopted Al Ham's Music of Your Life format, with local breaks being done by a student airstaff.  The station ran in the manner of a commercial broadcast operation, and marketing itself as ""The Voice of the Trojans"" airing the district's high school football and boys' basketball games as part of its program offerings.

WCRO today
In October 2018, it was announced the Lightner Communications out of Altoona would take over the day-to-day operations of the station.  It was also announced that WCRO planned to put on an FM translator to rebroadcast the signal into the Johnstown area on 102.9 FM.  The translator signed on a year later in November 2019.  With the addition of the translator, WCRO launched with a Christmas format branding as ""102.9/1230 WCRO The Christmas Station,"" a branding used on Lightner station WTRN in Tyrone.  On January 1, 2020, WCRO launched their new format using the moniker ""102.9/1230 WCRO Easy Favorites.""  This was also the format and branding used on WTRN at the time.  The station runs jockless throughout the day but does occasionally take breaks to air sports and other programming produced by the Greater Johnstown School District.

WCRO is also known for broadcasting a variety of sports including University of Pittsburgh football and men's basketball, as Pitt maintains a branch campus in Johnstown.  It also airs NASCAR's racing schedule, delivered by the Motor Racing Network.

Christmas music
Since Lightner Communications took over as operator, WCRO has run a Christmas Music format from the Monday before Thanksgiving until News Year Day, like sister station WTRN. During this time frame, WCRO competes with WCCL for the Christmas music audience in Johnstown and the surrounding areas.

Synopsis
Christopher and Adriana meet Christopher's cousin Greg and Greg's fiancée Amy. Amy works for Jon Favreau and they are filming in New York. She has been eager to meet Christopher and read his screenplay, saying that mob-themed stories are popular.  She quickly becomes attracted to him. Adriana has kept a copy of the screenplay Christopher threw away and persuades him to pass it to Jon and Amy. Christopher and Adriana are invited to the film set, but he goes alone. He is absorbed by what he sees and makes a dialogue suggestion that Jon adopts.

Jon wants to learn about mob customs and speech from Chris. Chris comes as arranged to meet him at his hotel room but he is not available, so   Chris calls on Amy instead. They talk, she begins to give advice about writing a screenplay, and they end up having sex. A few days later he sees her in the hotel lobby and they go to her room to have sex again, but afterwards she is overcome by guilt. Chris finds a screenplay by Jon and sees that Jon has stolen a mob anecdote that Chris told him in confidence. Furious, Chris searches for him, but he has returned to California. In the following days, Amy does not reply to his messages. He finally tracks her down; she tells him that Hollywood has lost interest in mob films, and ""It was wrong, with us."" After a heated argument, she walks away.

A.J. takes his mother's car without permission and damages it. When his parents rebuke him he baffles them by stating that life is absurd, and he does not wish to be confirmed because 'God is dead'. Tony consults Pussy, who is A.J.'s godfather and confirmation sponsor; Pussy says that at that age ""they get broody."" Tony consults Dr. Melfi, who explains that A.J. has discovered existentialism. A.J. consults his grandmother, who tells him not to expect happiness; everyone dies alone; ""It's all a big nothing.""

Pussy is forced by the FBI to wear a wire at A.J.'s confirmation and the ensuing reception at the Soprano home. During the reception, Tony discovers A.J. and two friends smoking marijuana in the garage. Pussy goes up to A.J.'s room, where he is sulking, and gently tells him that his father is a good man; A.J. is young and should enjoy life. He hugs him and sends him back down to the party, but Pussy himself goes into the bathroom and sobs.

Adriana has inadvertently told Tony about Chris' screenplay-writing. Chris misses the confirmation ceremony and arrives late for the reception. Tony then tells him he has a choice: either follow his other interests (and never see him again), or completely commit himself to Tony. Chris goes out and thinks it over, then goes back inside to Tony.

Title reference
The episode's title is a shortened title for ""development girl"", used mostly in the film and television industry; Chris calls Amy one.

Cultural references
 Christopher refers to the 1971 comedy film The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight when Favreau talks about his passion to make and star in another film about ""Crazy Joe Gallo.""
 Amy notes the 1999 romantic comedy Mickey Blue Eyes (which shares multiple actors with The Sopranos) when telling Christopher that Hollywood has lost interest in mob movies for the moment.
 Adriana tells Amy and John that she enjoyed Favreau's 1996 film Swingers, with Vince Vaughn.
 When Carmela and Tony express concern about AJ's existentialist pronouncements, Meadow quotes Mme de Staël:  ""One must choose in life between boredom and suffering.”
 Meadow says that A.J. has been assigned The Stranger, a novel by Albert Camus.
 A.J. says “God is dead”, explicitly citing Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (referring to him as “Nitch”), in “Thus Spoke Zarathustra”. 
 When Christopher relates the story of the woman whose lover threw acid in her face after becoming intimate and learning that she was actually transgender, Amy recalls the 1992 film The Crying Game.
 Amy relates Maslow's hierarchy of needs to Christopher before becoming intimate with him.
 When Amy tells Christopher they were wrong to have begun a relationship and Christopher responds that he really liked her, Amy observes that the mood has become rather ""William Inge"".
Upon seeing Sandra Bernhard on set Christopher notes her appearance in the 1982 film The King of Comedy which Chris mislabels as “Kings of Comedy”.

fr:La Garce (Les Soprano)Boltigen is a municipality in the Obersimmental-Saanen administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

Boltigen is a mixed community, with traits both of a burgese community and a village community. Beside it, there is also a reformed evangelical Church community. The history of the community goes back to 1386 and the so-called Freiheitsbrief von 1386.

The community president is Hermann Maurer, since 1 January 2005.

History

Boltigen is first mentioned in 1276.

The oldest trace of a settlement in the area is the mesolithic shelter in the Ranggiloch cave.  A few Bronze Age artifacts have also been found.  During the Middle Ages there were forts or castles at Simmenegg, Eichstalden and Laubegg though all three have fallen into ruin.  Many of the villages and Bäuerten were founded in the Early Middle Ages and grew slowly over the following centuries.  The villages and farm lands came under Bernese control partly in 1386 and completely in 1391.  When Bern acquired the lands, Adlemsried, Boltigen, Eschi, Schwarzenmatt and Weissenbach were all listed as villages.  Until the 15th century, Pfaffenried village (now part of Oberwil im Simmental) was part of Boltigen.  In 1502 Littisbach and Unterbächen were transferred from Zweisimmen to the municipality.

The local church of St. Mauritius was first mentioned in 1228.  In 1528, Bern accepted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, however the Bernese Oberland resisted the new faith and the church at Boltigen was part of the resistance.  When Bern forced the Oberland to accept the Reformation, Boltigen also converted.  The church was destroyed in a fire in 1840 and rebuilt shortly thereafter.

Traditionally, the villagers imported grain from Bern and raised cattle on the valley floor and in seasonal alpine herding camps.  Beginning in the 18th century, they began breeding and milking Simmental cattle, which became major exports from the municipality.  During the 18th and 19th century coal mines at Walopalp provided another source of income.  There was also some trade over the Jaun Pass.  The construction of the Simmental road in 1815-28 and the Jaun Pass road in 1872-75 expanded trade in the village and allowed it to grow.  The construction of the Erlenbach-Zweisimmen railway in 1902 made it easier to reach villages and allowed them to grow further.  Unlike some communities in the Oberland, tourism never developed into a major industry.  In 1990 about one-third of the jobs in the services sector, while 44% of the jobs are in agriculture.

87,60,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type4,"Montesquieu-Avantès () is a commune in the Ariège department in southwestern France.

History
 
Montesquieu-Avantès has a significant prehistory in the Pyrenees. The cave-complex was carved out by the Volp River resulting in three extensive caverns: , Trois-Frères and Tuc d'Audoubert. They were discovered by the Begouën children on October 10, 1912.

The caves contain unique works of art. The Salle des Bisons features two masterfully modelled bison, which were sculpted in clay with a stone spatula-like tool 17,000 years ago and show the imprint of the artist's fingers. The pair are among the largest and finest surviving prehistoric sculptures.

Occupied in the Upper Palaeolithic, notably during the Magdalenian Epoch, the caves have been extensively studied. These works on Tuc d'Audoubert were compiled in 2009 in a monograph entitled ""The Secret Sanctuary of the Bison"".  A subsequent book entitled ""The Cave of the Three Brothers"" (""La Caverne des Trois-Frères"") documents a century of research.  It was published in 2014 on the centenary of its discovery, on July 20, 1914.

These extremely fragile caves are closed to the public for the purposes of preservation.

Montesquieu was a country house founded in 1272 on the initiative of the Comte de Comminges Bernard VI.

13,62,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type6,"Otto Dix is a Russian dark wave music trio. Named after the expressionist painter of the same name, they are notable for their androgynous singer, the countertenor, Michael Draw.

The group's style
Otto Dix is a darkwave group with EBM and Industrial tunes. Draw calls their style ""electronic avant-garde."" The songs' themes centre around post-apocalyptic scenes, psychology, morals, and BDSM. The group uses strident, hysterical melodies in their music, sounding in minor tonalities. Some melodies are similar to Dark Ambient. Every song has a tiny solo performance and original image which is made by music, lyrics, Draw's movements, and unusual vocal abilities.

History
The musical band Otto Dix was formed in the summer of 2004 in Khabarovsk. The idea of the band and its name were introduced by Draw, who had participated in other bands before. At first, there was a third member who played the guitar. He introduced Draw to Slip, but some time later he left the band. Since then Otto Dix have been playing electronic music. Despite their European style, all songs are written in the Russian language. Draw believes that only the native language can fully express innermost thoughts.

Draw works as the centerpiece of the band and writes lyrics for their songs, and Slip composes music. Besides the band, they both write books and draw pictures. Their first appearance was on 28 November 2004. The band played only two songs (""White Dust"" and ""Penitence""). In 2004-2005 the band worked with the youth theatre ""Paradigm of Time."" Several articles about Otto Dix were published in the local press.

On 3 July, Otto Dix played their first concert away from their home city in Amursk. A few months later they recorded their first album, Ego, and shot a music video in a desolate factory in Amursk. Draw was the stage manager. However, due to the deplorable conditions of the Far Eastern musical culture the band did not fit any company, so they decided to form their own one. In winter 2005-2006 the gothic club ""Morion"" and a gothic forum were created by Draw.

In spring 2006, the Otto Dix performed in Vladivostok and, together with the members of Morion, shot a second video for the song ""White Dust."" The video hit the first place in the Far Eastern underground charts. In summer 2006 the band moved to St. Petersburg and released the album City. Soon after that a TV program about Otto Dix was broadcast in Khabarovsk. On 27 August, the first performance took place in St. Petersburg's ""Red Club."" It was successful, and Otto Dix were invited to play with the Italian Darkwave band The Frozen Autumn. Soon afterwards the band went on a mini-tour in support of the new album. On 2 March Otto Dix appeared in the TV program Unbelievable, But True on TNT. It gave a powerful stimulus to the band's development. Since then the new subculture movement ""stalker-goth"" began.

In 2007, Otto Dix toured numerous Russian cities. They had a great number of concerts, and this made them different from other bands of the similar genre.

Plot
The movie opens as Wyoming rancher Jim Kirk flees three bandits intent on robbing the money he earned by selling his Texas Longhorn herd. Back at his ranch, Kirk explains to his cowhand Andy that he is carrying a cashier's check made out to him, because he feared being robbed.

Kirk tells Andy that the price for Longhorns has fallen steeply. Kirk has a plan to breed Longhorns with Hereford cattle. He shows Andy a prototype that he has bred, which will have the stamina of a Longhorn and yield as much beef as a Hereford. The only place to get a herd of Herefords is in Oregon, and driving them all the way back to Wyoming seems insane to everyone but Kirk.

When Kirk deposits his check in town, Andy slips away to meet with Latimer, the gang leader who engineered the failed robbery of Kirk. Andy tells Latimer about Kirk's plan, and they agree to hijack the Herefords as Kirk drives them back to his ranch.

On their way to Oregon, Andy is shot by Native American horse thieves. Kirk walks on foot for miles to find a doctor, who just manages to save Andy's life. While Andy recovers, Kirk buys a herd of Herefords and tries to hire a road crew. Most men turn him down, because driving Herefords over the open range seems impossible. The only men who agree are a bunch of outlaws  whom nobody else will hire.

The cattle drive back to Wyoming is arduous, and the crew grows restless when they run out of meat. Kirk refuses to butcher one of the Herefords. Meanwhile, Andy meets with Latimer to plot the hijacking of the herd. They agree to start a stampede and force the cattle into a canyon, where they will kill Kirk and his crew.

Just before Andy is supposed to start the stampede, Kirk tells Andy that he will be the foreman of the crew when they return to Kirk's ranch, and he also offers Andy an ownership stake in the herd. When the stampede begins, Andy regrets his betrayal, and fires on Latimer and his henchmen. He is killed in the gun battle, but he helps to thwart Latimer's plan. The film ends as Kirk arrives back at his ranch with his Herefords.

Films scored by Raoul KraushaarMarc Morrone (born 1960 in Bronx, New York) is an American animal dealer and breeder and host of The Pet Shop with Marc Morrone for Mag Rack.

He also hosted Petkeeping with Marc Morrone, a television program produced by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which originally ended its run on September 17, 2006, although several stations throughout the country continue to air old episodes to meet their E/I requirements. It was in production again on the Hallmark Channel in 2011-2012. He currently lives with his wife and many pets.

Early life and career
At age four, Morrone adopted his first pet, a parakeet named Jinxie.  By age 18, Morrone's pet collection had outgrown his parents' house.  In 1978, Morrone opened a pet store Parrots of the World. with his business partner Nick Guerra in Rockville Centre, New York. The store has since grown into a large business and as of November 2021 it is still in operation.

Morrone's television career began as a guest on the News 12 program The Family Pet.  In 1995, he started a cable show, Extra Help Pet Show, later renamed Metro Pets.  His practice of crowding several animals in a small space on-camera was allegedly born of necessity — Morrone claimed it was needed to keep the animals warm in the unheated television studio. Because there were so many animals of different species all together, it resulted in occasional scuffles between the animals. The local cable show led to Morrone's guest appearances with Martha Stewart on her television program Martha Stewart Living, starting in 1997. In 2001, Hearst Entertainment began syndication of The Pet Shop With Marc Morrone.

Petkeeping with Marc Morrone
In 2003, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia gave him a half-hour show, Petkeeping with Marc Morrone. The program is taped on location in his pet store. Morrone was also a frequent contributor to Kids magazine, also published by Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and currently hosts a weekly radio program Petkeeping for Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Sirius Satellite Radio.

Pets which have appeared on Petkeeping

List of episodes

The Pet Shop with Marc Morrone
In March 2006 Morrone was featured on Mag Rack, in the Video On Demand series The Pet Shop with Marc Morrone. The program follows a similar format as Petkeeping, and aims to offer helpful and useful advice on caring for a variety of animals. It also includes appearance by his pets including Harry, a scarlet macaw; Splash, a ferret; and Harvey, a 13-pound Flemish rabbit. 25 episodes were developed for the first season, and cover various topics such as alternatives to dogs as pets, housetraining pets, caring for smaller animals, and tips on setting up and maintaining aquariums.

Thieves rob Parrots of the World
On August 15, 2007, robbers broke into Morrone's Parrots of the World store through a back window and stole 45 parrots, including cockatoos, grey parrots and a toucan. The lot was valued at over $60,000. Morrone expressed concern for the pilfered parrots because they require special food and care and could die if they become overstressed. None of the stolen birds were Morrone's pets that have appeared on  television with him, although many of them also live in the store.

Books
Morrone has authored five books, Ask The Dog Keeper, Ask The Cat Keeper, Ask The Fish Keeper and Ask the Bird Keeper, all published by Bowtie Press in 2009. A Man For All Species, a book about the adventures of an animal keeper, was published by Random House in 2010.

49,67,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type1,"Austen Herbert Croom-Johnson (20 October 1909 Hereford, England – 18 May 1964 Manhattan, New York City) was an English-born pianist, composer, and radio producer: first, until about 1935, for the BBC, then, from about 1936, for NBC. He went on to become a prolific jingle writer, first beginning around 1938 in radio with his chief collaborator, Alan Kent, then, beginning around 1947, in television. Croom-Johnson and Kent are widely credited for being the fathers of the modern short jingle.

Career 
Austen Herbert Croom-Johnson – nicknamed ""Bunny"" and ""Ginger"" Croom-Johnson – was born in Hereford. His double surname, ""Croom-Johnson,"" are the surnames of his paternal great-grandparents, Henry Johnson ( 1795–18??) and Catherine Croom ( 1795–1876).  Austen moved to New York City in 1935. Before moving to New York City, he had worked for the British Broadcasting Company for many years as a producer and performer. One of the programs he created for the BBC, Soft Lights and Music, became very popular. While in England, he wrote themes for Billy Mayerl's ""Green Tulips"" and ""Bats in the Belfry.""

Croom-Johnson was enthusiastic about jazz, and in particular, English composer Frederick Delius (1862–1934).

In commercial music, Croom-Johnson imported the tune, ""D'ye ken John Peel?,"" and scored it for a 1939 jingle, ""Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot"" (aka ""Nickel, Nickel""). His Chicago-born lyricist partner, Alan Bradley Kent (né Karl Dewitt Byington, Jr.; 1912–1991), wrote the words. Its first and most enduring recording was performed – jazz-swing style, uptempo – by the Tune Twisters, a male vocal jazz trio that, for the prior 5 years, had been enjoying popularity on non-jazz oriented broadcasts from New York City. Lord & Thomas, a bygone New York City advertising agency, had commissioned songwriters Johnson and Kent to develop the campaign; and Newell-Emmett, another bygone New York City advertising agency, managed it for Pepsi-Cola. The jingle is the first in several respects. It is the first to become a hit, as popular music, on network radio, coast to coast – owed in part to the catchiness of the tune. It proved so popular that, in some cases, radio stations played it as entertainment rather than as advertising. It also is the first jingle with a short run-time, an innovation that changed broadcast advertising. In an era when advertisements ran often 5 minutes and employed annoyance factors, ""Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot"" was the first to run slightly under 15 seconds, which permitted many more repetitions. The jingle, in 1999, was ranked by AdAge's ""Top 100 Advertising Campaigns"" as the No. 1 jingle of the 1940s and No. 14 of all time.

April 1984 sports events in the United StatesMammoth (Baran Flinders) is a fictional character and comic book supervillain from DC Comics. Alongside his sister Shimmer, he is a founding member of the Fearsome Five and usually an enemy of the Teen Titans.

Publication history
Mammoth first appeared in The New Teen Titans #3 (January 1981) and was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez.

Fictional character biography
Mammoth is one of the founding members of the Fearsome Five, and became an enemy of the Teen Titans, Superman, and the Outsiders. He is highly devoted to his sister Selinda (a.k.a. Shimmer), also a founding member of the Fearsome Five. A towering hulk of a man with immense physical strength and durability, Mammoth is intellectually and emotionally underdeveloped (so much so that he was once tricked into surrendering to a Superman whose powers had recently been lost thanks to Lex Luthor's use of Mister Mxyzptlk's red kryptonite thanks to Superman simply faking confidence that he could defeat Mammoth), and he lacks skill as a hand-to-hand combatant.

Mammoth at one point retired to a Tibetan monastery along with his sister although shortly thereafter discovered Psimon (himself a former member of the Fearsome Five). Psimon used his mental abilities to subdue Mammoth and turn Shimmer into glass, which he then proceeded to shatter in an act of vengeance. Mammoth subsequently works with former ally Gizmo, apparently unable to comprehend his sister was dead, and believing they were looking for her.

Mammoth later appears in a fight with Booster Gold, which he loses. He is surprised at being found out, as his crime was a spur-of-the-moment deal (he did not understand Gold has access to future information).

Mammoth alongside his Fearsome Five teammates appeared as members of the Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.

On the cover of Justice League of America (vol. 2) #13 , it shows Mammoth as a member of the new Injustice League and is one of the villains featured in Salvation Run. He is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the Secret Six.

18,70,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type9,"is a Japanese anime television series conceived and directed by Akitaro Daichi, with a screenplay by Hideyuki Kurata.  It premiered in Japan on the WOWOW television station on October 14, 1999 and ran until January 20, 2000. It was licensed for Region 1 DVD English language release by Central Park Media under their US Manga Corps label. Following the 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films rescued the series for a boxset re-release on July 7, 2009. However, the ADV re-release is now out of print. The series is available for purchase through iTunes, YouTube and Google Play.

Now and Then, Here and There follows a young boy named Shuzo ""Shu"" Matsutani who, in an attempt to save an unknown girl, is transported to another world which may be the Earth in the far future. The world is desolate and militarized, survival is a daily struggle for displaced refugees, and water is a scarce commodity.

Plot

While walking home from school, ""Shu"", the main protagonist and a boy who loves Kendo, intercedes to protect a girl, Lala-Ru, who is attacked by abductors piloting dragon-like mechas and is accidentally transported to the attackers' world as a result — a wasteland devoid of water and dominated by a red giant star. Lala-Ru possesses a pendant containing a vast reservoir of water, and she has the ability to control it.

Shu is trapped in this new, harsh reality, and he is beaten and interrogated repeatedly inside the warship commanded by the ruthless, manic dictator, Hamdo. While locked in a cell he meets an abducted girl who introduces herself as Sara Ringwalt of America. Sara's reason for her capture was being mistaken for Lala-Ru by Hamdo's minions. Sara is forced into the quarters of exceptional soldiers to be impregnated and is traumatized by her repeated rape. After an assault by an unknown enemy landship, Shu is forced to join an army of child soldiers; children trained for the looting of villages, in which they kidnap female villagers for breeding, and conscript orphaned male children into the ever dwindling ranks of Hamdo's army.

It is a haunting story of a dystopian world, and of Shuu, who has to endure torture, hunger, and the horrors of war in order to save the lonely girl he found sitting atop a smokestack. Much of the series deals with serious moral issues relating to war and famine, the consequences of war, slavery, rape, and the exploitation of children.

Characters
  is a student of kendo and carries a shinai, though he fights primarily with a wooden stick, which also is a motif for his non-lethal combat style. After being thrust into a new world and brutally interrogated, he is forced to join the child army of Hellywood. Shu's character is strong-willed, uncompromising, obstinate, and believes that good can come from all situations. His devotion to protect Lala-Ru is one of the main aspects of the story. His experiences and interactions with Lala-Ru, Hamdo, and Nabuca open his eyes to the new world. Despite overwhelming odds, he retains his principles of not killing and of believing that good will still come while one is alive. After saving the world by convincing Lala-Ru that people are good, Shu is sent back home by a reformed Abelia. 
  possesses the power to manipulate water using a pendant containing a now nearly-depleted water reservoir, which is directly tied to her physical strength and health. She is quiet and non-violent (often failing to resist violence against her) and appears to be a child, although her age is unknown (she claims to be thousands of years old). Due to her long and disillusioned experience with humans, she feels little to no emotions with them. Her relationship with Shu changes her to be more protective and open with Shu and Sis; Shu for risking his life despite being in a foreign land as well as knowing nothing about her, and Sis for treating her like a daughter despite not knowing her very long. After using her power to flood Hellywood and parts of the world with water she soon vanished from existence right next to Shu after seeing the sunset for the last time. 
 , the military leader of a kingdom called Hellywood, he is a shrewd but has the mentality of a spoiled ten-year-old child, paranoid megalomaniac. He feels a sense of entitlement to water, an essential resource in his plans to rule the Earth, that leads to an obsession with the mysterious Lala-Ru and the suppression of any who stand in his way. Water is also required to launch his flying fortress, which is powered by water. In a quest to secure water and other resources needed for his ultimate goal, Hamdo's army abducts children and other villagers to use as human capital in his endeavor. Hamdo suffers from uncontrollable bursts of rage. In a gruesome display of his blind emotion, he kills a cat, only to throw it on the ground and step on it later while interrogating Shu. Later in the series, Hamdo's lust for water and power begets paranoia and he begins to doubt the loyalty of his adviser. He died at the end of the series when he drowned in the transport chamber (all the while suffering a complete mental breakdown, screaming and shrieking like a frightened child), his lifeless corpse dragged away by the current. 
  is the devoted commanding officer of Hamdo's army. She is a capable military strategist, though Hamdo does not always heed her advice. Abelia thanklessly yields to the whim of her senior. By the series' end, she'd given up on supporting Hamdo's ambitions and leaves him to die amidst the chaos of his eroding empire. She then joins the free world to establish a peaceful future alongside them. 
  is the leader of the child army unit Shu is forced to join. He resents Shu and sees him as a troublemaker. He feels ashamed for Shu having saved his life during a fight. Nabuca, just a child himself, devotes himself entirely to the army in the hopes that he will someday be allowed to return to his home. He repeatedly tells himself that what he does is the only thing that will enable him to return home, and this thought is the only thing keeping him going. Once Boo dies trying to protect him, he eventually comes to realize all too late the nature of his actions and has a sudden change of heart. In the last episode, he is betrayed and mortally wounded by Tabool, one of the boys in his unit and the only other survivor from their village. After painfully making his way to the jail cell where Shu is being kept with other prisoners from Zari-Bars, he tells Shu to go back to where he came from and that it is where he belongs. He dies immediately after in the arms of Shu who holds him through the prison cell bars. 
  is the youngest soldier in Nabuca's unit and his closest companion. He is naïve, and like Nabuca, believes he will be sent home after the war until then end where he loses hope of regaining a sense of normalcy and cannot go on. Boo dies during the invasion of Zari-Bars in episode 12 where he takes a bullet for Nabuca. 
  is an American girl who is mistaken for Lala-Ru and is kidnapped on her way to pick up her father from work. She is taken to Hellywood where she is regularly raped by the Hellywood soldiers, one of whom she murders in self-defense. After escaping from Hellywood, she is rescued from the desert sands by Sis who brings her to Zari-Bars. Sara resents Lala-Ru and blames her solely for the predicament she is in. Unable to cope with the pain of being raped and carrying a child as a result of her ordeal, she attempts to commit suicide and abort the baby by pounding a rock into her abdomen. Shu, however, intervenes, taking the blows of the rock on his hand which he uses to cover her abdomen. Sis' dying request that she not hate the faultless baby changes Sara's mind and she decides to stay in the desert world with her baby, Sis' orphans, and ex-Hellywood child soldiers to start a new life. 
  is a boy soldier in Nabuca's unit who came from the same village as Nabuca. He appears captivated with the actions of Hamdo and his war and is uninterested in returning home. He is attracted to the strength of the military, and bullies others in the unit. In the final episode, he shoots and mortally wounds Nabuca, and not long after, he dies while trying to survive Hellywood's destruction by Lala-Ru's flood, being drowned in the water and his lifeless body sucked away by the current. 
  is a tough and respected member of the city-state Zari-Bars. She acts as a caretaker and stand-in mother for the children who were orphaned as result of the war state. She advocates non-violence. When Sis tries to stop Elamba from taking Lala-Ru hostage, she is shot in the leg and dies in the final episode from the bleeding. 
  is the leader of the radical faction at Zari-Bars. His entire family was murdered by Hellywood's soldiers. Periodically, he sends assassins into Hellywood to try to kill King Hamdo. Ironically, Elamba's ruthless methods resemble those of the man he hates. He seizes Lala-Ru and tries unsuccessfully to use her to negotiate with Hellywood. This ends with him being sprayed by bullets and falling to his death. 
  is a quiet young girl living with Sis and the orphans in Zari-Bars. She spends many days separated from the other children her age in hopes that her father may one day return. Little does she know that her father was one of Elamba's assassins that died at the hands of Nabuca and the other Hellywood soldiers. In the meanwhile, she begins to open up to both Shu and Lala-Ru, requesting that they stay even when the radicals of the village turn against them. When she overhears Nabuca admit to killing the assassins, Soon attempts to kill Nabuca with a rifle but fails to do so due to Boo's self-sacrifice. Nabuca, horrified and almost reflexively shoots her to death in return.

United States
 New Hampshire Route 25C
 New York State Route 25C (former)Vespro della Beata Vergine (Vespers for the Blessed Virgin), SV 206, is a musical setting by Claudio Monteverdi of the evening vespers on Marian feasts, scored for soloists, choirs, and orchestra. It is an ambitious work in scope and in its variety of style and scoring, and has a duration of around 90 minutes. Published in Venice (with a dedication to Pope Paul V dated 1 September 1610) as  (""Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices, and Vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers""), it is sometimes called Monteverdi's Vespers of 1610.

Monteverdi composed the music while musician and composer for the Gonzagas, the dukes of Mantua. The libretto is compiled from several Latin Biblical and liturgical texts. The thirteen movements include the introductory Deus in adiutorium, five Psalms, four concertato motets and a vocal sonata on the ""Sancta Maria"" litany, several differently scored stanzas of the hymn ""Ave maris stella"", and a choice of two Magnificats. A church performance would have included antiphons in Gregorian chant for the specific feast day. The composition demonstrates Monteverdi's ability to assimilate both the new seconda pratica, such as in the emerging opera, and the old style of the prima pratica, building psalms and Magnificat on the traditional plainchant as a cantus firmus. The composition is scored for up to ten vocal parts and instruments including cornettos, violins, viole da braccio, and basso continuo. Monteverdi travelled to Rome to deliver the composition to the Pope in person, and a partbook is held by the Vatican Library.

No performance during the composer's lifetime can be positively identified from surviving documents, though parts of the work might have been performed at the ducal chapels in Mantua and at San Marco in Venice, where the composer became director of music in 1613. The work received renewed attention from musicologists and performers in the 20th century. They have discussed whether it is a planned composition in a modern sense or a collection of music suitable for Vespers, and have debated the role of the added movements, instrumentation, keys and other issues of historically informed performance. The first recording of excerpts from the Vespers was released in 1953; many recordings that followed presented all the music printed in 1610. In some recordings and performances, antiphons for a given occasion of the church year are added to create a liturgical vespers service, while others strictly present only the printed music. Monteverdi's Vespers are regarded as a unique milestone of music history, at the transition from Renaissance to Baroque.

History and context

Monteverdi in Mantua 
Monteverdi, who was born in Cremona in 1567, was a court musician for the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua from 1590 to 1612. He began as a viol player under Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga and advanced to become maestro della musica in late 1601. He was responsible for the duke's sacred and secular music, in regular church services and soirées on Fridays, and for extraordinary events. While Monteverdi was court musician in Mantua, the opera genre emerged, first as entertainment for nobility, to become public musical theatre later. The first work now considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri's Dafne of 1597. In the new genre, a complete story was told through characters; as well as choruses and ensembles, the vocal parts included recitative, aria, and arioso. Monteverdi's first opera was L'Orfeo which premiered in 1607. The duke was quick to recognise the potential of this new musical form for bringing prestige to those willing to sponsor it.

Monteverdi wrote the movements of the Vespers piece by piece, while responsible for the ducal services which were held at the Santa Croce chapel at the palace. He completed the large-scale work in 1610. He possibly composed the Vespers aspiring to a better position, and the work demonstrates his abilities as a composer in a great variety of styles. The setting was Monteverdi's first published sacred composition after his initial publications nearly thirty years before and stands out for its assimilation of both the old and the new styles.

Vespers 

The liturgical vespers is an evening prayer service according to the Catholic Officium Divinum (Divine Office). At Monteverdi's time, it was sung in Latin, as were all Catholic services then. A vespers service at the time contained five psalms, a hymn and the Magnificat (Mary's song of praise). The five psalms for Marian feasts (as well as other female saints) begin with Psalm 110 in Hebrew counting, but known to Monteverdi as Psalmus 109 in the numbering of the Vulgate:

The individual psalms and the Magnificat are concluded by the doxology Gloria Patri. The hymn for Marian feasts was ""Ave maris stella"". Variable elements, changing with the liturgical occasion, are antiphons, inserted before each psalm and the Magnificat, which reflect the specific feast and connect the Old Testament psalms to Christian theology. Vespers are traditionally framed by the opening versicle and response from Psalm 70, and the closing blessing.

On ordinary Sundays, the vespers service might by sung in Gregorian chant, while on high holidays, such as the feast day of a patron saint, elaborate concertante music was preferred. In his Vespers, Monteverdi may have offered such music without necessarily expecting that all of it would be performed in a given service.

Monteverdi deviated from the typical vespers liturgy by adding motets (concerti or sacri concentus) between the psalms. Scholars debate if they were meant to replace antiphons or rather as embellishments of the preceding psalm. Monteverdi also included a Marian litany, ""Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis"" (Holy Mary, pray for us). All liturgical texts are set using their psalm tones in Gregorian chant, often as a cantus firmus.

Graham Dixon suggests the setting is more suited for the feast of Saint Barbara, claiming, for example, that the texts from the Song of Songs are applicable to any female saint but that a dedication to fit a Marian feast made the work more ""marketable"". There are just two Marian songs in the whole work (""Audi coelum"" and ""Ave maris stella""); and the sonata could easily be rearranged to any saint's name.

First publication 

The first mention of the work's publication is in a July 1610 letter by Monteverdi's assistant, Bassano Casola, to Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga, the duke's younger son. Casola described that two compositions were in the process to be printed, a six-part mass (Messa da Capella) on motifs from Nicolas Gombert's In illo tempore, and psalms for a vespers setting for the Virgin (Salmi del Vespro della Madonna). He described the psalms as ""varying and diverse inventions and harmonies over a canto fermo"" (cantus firmus), and noted that Monteverdi would travel to Rome to personally dedicate the publication to the Pope in the autumn.

The printing was completed in Venice, then an important centre for music printing. The printing of collections of sacred music in Italy at the period was described as ""a fast-growing and very large and lucrative market"", with around 50 collections in 1610 alone, 36 of them for offices such as Vespers. The publisher was Ricciardo Amadino, who had published Monteverdi's opera L'Orfeo in 1609. While the opera was published as a score, the Vespers music appeared as a set of partbooks. It was published together with Monteverdi's mass Missa in illo tempore. The cover describes both works: ""Sanctissimae Virgini Missa senis vocibus ad ecclesiarum choros, ac Vespere pluribus decantandae cum nonnullis sacris concentibus ad Sacella sive Principum Cubicula accommodata"" (Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices for church choirs, and vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers).

One of the partbooks contains the basso continuo and provides a kind of short score for the more complicated movements: it gives the title of the Vespers as: ""Vespro della Beata Vergine da concerto composta sopra canti firmi"" (Vesper for the Blessed Virgin for concertos, composed on cantus firmi).

Monteverdi's notation is still in the style of Renaissance music, for example regarding the duration of notes and the absence of bar lines. There is no score, but a partbook for each voice and instrument. The corresponding continuo notes the beginnings of text lines, for example Magnificat, ""Et exultauit"", ""Quia respexit"" and ""Quia fecit"", and the names of instruments, for example cornetto, trombone and flauto. The initials of a title are embellished, such as the M of Magnificat, and in the voice part, the initials of a cantus firmus line begins with a larger letter, e.g. ""E t exultauit..."" and ""Q uia respexit..."". Sections where the voice or instrument is silent are marked ""Tacet."". The notation poses challenges to editors adopting the current system of notation, which established about a half century after Vespers was written.

Monteverdi dedicated the work to Pope Paul V, who had recently visited Mantua, and dated the dedication 1 September 1610. The schedule seems to have resulted in some of the movements being printed in haste and some corrections had to be made. Monteverdi visited Rome, as anticipated, in October 1610 and it is likely that he delivered a copy to the Pope, given that the Papal Library holds an alto partbook. It is not clear whether he was honoured with a papal audience. The alto partbook which the Pope received, with hand-written corrections, survived in the Biblioteca Doria Pamphilij.

Monteverdi later wrote further music for vespers services, in the collection Selva morale e spirituale, published in 1641, and in another collection, Messa e Salmi (Mass and Psalms) which was published after his death in 1650. There is no indication that any of his publications of sacred music received a second edition.

Later publication 
After the original print, the next time parts from the Vespers were published was in an 1834 book by Carl von Winterfeld devoted to the music of Giovanni Gabrieli. He chose the beginning of the Dixit Dominus and of the Deposuit from the Magnificat, discussing the variety of styles in detail. Luigi Torchi published the Sonata as the first complete movement from the Vespers at the turn of the 20th century. The first modern edition of the Vespers appeared in 1932 as part of Gian Francesco Malipiero's edition of Monteverdi's complete works. Two years later, Hans F. Redlich published an edition which dropped two psalms, arranged the other movements in different order, and implemented the figured bass in a complicated way. In 1966, Gottfried Wolters edited the first critical edition. Critical editions were published by, among others, Clifford Bartlett in 1986, Jerome Roche in 1994, and Uwe Wolf in 2013, while Antonio Delfino has edited the Vespers for a complete edition of the composer's works.

Performance 
The historical record does not indicate whether Monteverdi actually performed the Vespers in Mantua or in Rome, where he was not offered a post. He assumed the position of maestro di cappella at the Basilica di San Marco in Venice in 1613 and a performance there seems likely. Church music in Venice is well documented and performers can draw information for historically informed performances from that knowledge, for example that Monteverdi expected a choir of all male voices.

The Vespers is monumental in scale and requires a choir of ten or more vocal parts split into separate choirs, and seven soloists. Solo instrumental parts are written for violin and cornetto. Antiphons preceding each psalm and the Magnificat, sung in plainchant, would vary with the occasion. Some scholars have argued that the Vespers was not intended as a single work but rather as a collection to choose from.

The edition by Redlich was the basis for performances in Zurich in 1935 and of parts in New York in 1937, among others. It was printed in 1949 and used for the first recording in 1953. The first recording of the work with added antiphons was conducted in 1966 by Jürgen Jürgens. Recent performances have usually aimed to provide the complete music Monteverdi published.

Music

Structure 
Vespro della Beata Vergine is made up of 13 sections. The ""Ave maris stella"" is in seven stanzas set to different scoring, with interspersed ritornelli. The Magnificat is in twelve movements, which Monteverdi wrote in two versions.

The following table shows the section numbers according to the 2013 edition by Carus, then the function of the section within the Vespers, its text source, and the beginning of the text both in Latin and in English. The column for the voices has abbreviations SATB for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. A repeated letter means the voice part is divided, for example TT means ""tenor1 and tenor2"". The column for instruments often contains only their number, because Monteverdi did not always specify the instruments. The continuo plays throughout but is listed below (as ""continuo"") only when it has a role independent of the other instruments or voices. The last column lists the page number of the beginning of the section in the Carus edition.

Sections

1 Deus in adjutorium meum intende/Domine ad adjuvandum me festina 

The work opens with the traditional versicle and response for vespers services, the beginning of Psalm 70 (Psalm 69 in the Vulgate),  (Make haste, O God, to deliver me). It is sung by a solo tenor, with the response from the same verse,  (Make haste to help me, O LORD), sung by a six-part choir. The movement is accompanied by a six-part orchestra with two cornettos, three trombones (which double the lower strings), strings, and continuo.

The music is based on the opening toccata from Monteverdi's 1607 opera L'Orfeo, to which the choir sings a falsobordone (a style of recitation) on the same chord. The music has been described as ""a call to attention"" and ""a piece whose brilliance is only matched by the audacity of its conception"".

2 Dixit Dominus 
The first psalm, Psalm 110, begins with  (The LORD said unto my Lord). Monteverdi set it for a six-part choir with divided sopranos and tenors, and six instruments, prescribing . The first tenor begins alone with the cantus firmus. The beginnings of verses are often in falsobordone recitation, leading to six-part polyphonic settings.

3 Nigra sum 
The first motet begins  (I am black, but beautiful), from the Song of Songs. It is written for tenor solo in the new style of monody (a melodic solo line with accompaniment).

4 Laudate pueri 

Psalm 113 begins  (literally: 'Praise, children, the Lord'; in the KJV: 'Praise ye the Lord, O ye servants of the Lord'), and contains eight vocal parts and continuo. The second tenor begins alone with the cantus firmus.

5 Pulchra es 
The second motet begins  (You are beautiful) from the Song of Songs. Monteverdi set it for two sopranos, who often sing in third parallels.

6 Laetatus sum 
The third psalm is Psalm 122, beginning  (literally: 'I was glad'), a pilgrimage psalm. The music begins with a walking bass, which the first tenor enters with the cantus firmus. The movement is based on four patterns in the bass line and includes complex polyphonic settings and duets.

7 Duo Seraphim 
The third motet begins  (Two angels were calling one to the other), a text combined from Isaiah 6:2–3 and the First Epistle of John, 5:7. Monteverdi set it for three tenors. The first part, talking about the two angels, is a duet. When the text turns to the epistle mentioning the Trinity, the third tenor joins. They sing the text ""these three are one"" in unison. The vocal lines are highly ornamented.

8 Nisi Dominus 
The fourth psalm, Psalm 127, opens with the words  (Except the Lord [build the house]), and is for two tenors singing the cantus firmus and two four-part choirs, one echoing the other in overlapped singing.

9 Audi coelum 
The fourth motet opens with the words  (Hear my words, Heaven), based on an anonymous liturgical poem. It is set for two tenors, who sing in call and response (), and expands to six voices at the word  (all).

10 Lauda Jerusalem 
The fifth psalm, Psalm 147, begins  (Praise, Jerusalem), and is set for two three-part choirs (SAB) and tenors singing the cantus firmus.

11 Sonata sopra Sancta Maria 
The sonata is an instrumental movement with soprano singing of a cantus firmus from the Litany of Loreto (Holy Mary, pray for us), with rhythmic variants. The movement opens with an instrumental section comparable to a pair of pavane and galliard, the same material first in even metre, then in triple metre. The vocal line appears eleven times, while the instruments play uninterrupted virtuoso music reminiscent of vocal parts in the motets.

12 Hymnus: Ave maris stella 

The penultimate section is devoted to the 8th century Marian hymn """". Its seven stanzas are set in different scoring. The melody is in the soprano in all verses except verse6, which is for tenor solo. Verse1 is a seven-part setting. Verses2 and3 are the same vocal four-part setting, verse2 for choir1, verse3 for choir3. Similarly, verses4 and5 are set for soprano, first soprano1, then soprano2. Verses1 to5 are all followed by the same ritornello for five instruments. Verse7 is the same choral setting as verse1, followed by Amen.

The hymn setting has been regarded as conservative, the chant melody in the upper voice throughout, but variety is achieved by different numbers of voices and interspersion of a ritornello. The instruments are not specified, to provide further variety. The last stanza repeats the first for formal symmetry.

13 Magnificat 
The last movement of a vespers service is the Magnificat. Monteverdi devotes a movement to every verse of the canticle, and two to the doxology. Depending on the mood of the text, the Magnificat is scored for a choir of up to seven voices, in solo, duo, or trio singing. Monteverdi uses the Magnificat tone in every movement, a tone similar to the psalm tones but with an initium (beginning) which provides the possibility of more harmonic variety.

The publication contains a second setting of the Magnificat for six voices and continuo accompaniment.

Analysis 
Monteverdi achieved a collection of great variety both in style and structure, which was unique at the time. Styles range from chordal falsobordone to virtuoso singing, from recitative to polyphonic setting of many voices, and from continuo accompaniment to extensive instrumental obbligato. Structurally, he demonstrated different organisation in all movements.

John Butt, who conducted a recording in 2017 with the Dunedin Consort using one voice per part, summarised the many styles:

Butt described the first three psalms as radical in style, while the other two rather follow the polychoral style of Gabrieli, suggesting that the first three may have been composed especially with the publication in mind.

The musicologist Jeffrey Kurtzman observed that the five free concertos (or motets) follow a scheme to first increase then decrease the number of singers, from one to three and back to one, but they increase the number of performers from the first to the last, adding more voices at the end of the fourth and having eight instruments play for the last. In prints by other composers, such concertos appear as a group, usually sorted by number of voices, while Monteverdi interspersed them with the psalms.

In Monteverdi's time, it was common to improvise and make adjustments during performances, depending on the acoustics and the availability and capability of performers. The print of his Vespers shows unusual detail in reducing this freedom, for example, by precise notation of embellishments and even organ registration.

Recordings

The first recording of the Vespers was arguably an American performance in 1952, featuring musicians from the University of Illinois conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The recording was released in LP format, probably in 1953, but appears not to have been commercially distributed. The work has since been recorded many times in several versions, involving both modern and period instruments. Some recordings allocate the voice parts to choirs, while others use the ""one voice per part"" concept.

In 1964, John Eliot Gardiner assembled a group of musicians to perform the work in King's College Chapel, Cambridge. The event became the birth of the later Monteverdi Choir. Gardiner recorded the Vespers twice, in 1974 and in 1989.

Although some musicologists argue that Monteverdi was offering a compendium of music for vespers services from which a selection could be made, most recordings present the composition as a unified work, deciding which of the two versions of scoring to perform. Recordings differ in presenting strictly what Monteverdi composed, or in liturgical context, with added antiphons for a specific feast day. In his 2005 version, Paul McCreesh also included music from other publications and changed the order of several movements.

Modern reception 
Kurtzman, who edited a publication of the work for Oxford University Press, notes: ""...it seems as if Monteverdi were intent in displaying his skills in virtually all contemporary styles of composition, using every modern structural technique"". Monteverdi achieved overall unity by using the Gregorian plainchant as a cantus firmus, for the beginning, the psalms, the litany and the Magnificat. This ""rigorous adhesion to the psalm tones"" is similar to the style of Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, who was choirmaster at the Basilica palatina di Santa Barbara at the ducal palace in Mantua. Whenham summarised about the use of chant:

Musicologists have debated topics such as the role of the sacri concentus and sonata, instrumentation, keys (chiavette), and issues of historically informed performance.

The musicologist Tim Carter summarised in his entry for the composer for Grove in 2007: ""His three major collections of liturgical and devotional music transcend the merely functional, exploiting a rich panoply of text-expressive and contrapuntal-structural techniques."" Kurtzmann concluded from his detailed research of Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine and contemporary sacred music:

People are also more likely than the average to have consumer goods. Life expectancy for men and women is also just above the national average.

However, reported GDP per capita is below the national average, and the regional wage levels are one-sixth below the national average. However, the likelihood of not being paid regularly is also below the national average. The discrepancies between these data and positive optimism of individuals can be influenced by the fact that in the Volga economic region those reporting having a second job are also above the national average.

Nealon Federal Building and United States Courthouse is a courthouse of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, located in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It was completed in 1931, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

Building history
Scranton's first post office opened in 1811, but utilized rented space until the city's first federally owned post office building was erected in 1894. The Second Empire-style building soon proved to be too small for the city's needs, an issue compounded by the establishment of the Middle District Federal Court. Following numerous efforts to obtain funding for a new building, the federal government appropriated $2.5 million in 1926. The 1894 building was demolished in 1930. In 1929, chief of architectural design Louis A. Simon at the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, completed plans for a new building on the site.

With N.P. Severin Company serving as the general contractor, groundbreaking occurred on May 20, 1930. The new federal building was completed the following year at a cost of $1,004,000, with dedication ceremonies taking place on October 19, 1931. In 1981, the United States Postal Service sold the building to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and moved its main office to a new site, though it maintains a small branch in the building. In 1985, GSA began a $4.3 million rehabilitation of damaged historic materials such as doors, light fixtures, and interior finishes. A glass-and-steel atrium and annex were added in 1999. The annex received several awards, including a GSA Design Award Architecture Citation and a Pennsylvania AIA Merit Award.

In 1999, the building was renamed in honor of William J. Nealon, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania from 1976 to 1989. The building is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

Architecture
The building is a four-story, Art Deco-influenced Neoclassical building executed in limestone and brick with a granite base, green serpentine columns, and terracotta with polychrome accents. Characteristics of Neoclassical style include symmetry, smooth stone surfaces, and colonnades. Art Deco influences are apparent in polychrome (multicolored) ornamental details, low-relief geometrical designs, and decorative forms based on nature.

The elevations facing Washington and Linden Avenues are bilaterally symmetrical with the more ornamental Washington Avenue facade facing Courthouse Square. These elevations are sheathed in a smooth-dressed granite base up to the first story, and limestone blocks from the second to the fourth story. Most of the Washington Avenue facade is recessed at the third and fourth floors with engaged green serpentine columns highlighted by terracotta Corinthian capitals. The entire composition is topped by a polychrome terra-cotta entablature. Metal spandrel panels are below the third-story windows and marble spandrels below the fourth-story windows. Three bronze doors with bronze and cast aluminum grills comprise the entrances at Washington and Linden Avenues.

The entrances on Washington Avenue lead to the elevator lobby, which is the main entrance to the court facilities on the fourth floor. The entry on the Linden Avenue facade leads to the post office lobby on the ground floor. Historic materials include marble, bronze, clay tile, simulated stone, cast iron, oak detailing, and decorative stencils.

Two original courtrooms are on the fourth floor. Each has oak-paneled wainscoting capped by a carved frieze at door height, interrupted by windows and the wall behind the judge's bench. In Courtroom No. 1, behind the judge's bench is a curtained area with oak columns and an entablature with a mural, titled Justice with Peace and Prosperity (artist unknown), installed soon after the building was completed. In Courtroom No. 2, there is a marble panel with bronze grill trim and a drapery surround behind the judge's bench. The plaster ceilings feature a plaster cornice and plaster bands dividing the ceiling into nine panels.

Built in 1999, the annex is a four-story, steel-reinforced masonry building with a facade clad in limestone to match the historic courthouse building. Designed by the architecture and planning firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in conjunction with hemmler + camayd architects, the annex fronts on Washington Avenue. Although its restrained design features no overt references to the classical detailing of the 1931 building, its materials and proportions are similar. The facade is divided into upper and lower halves, but in lieu of a colonnade, the upper half is embellished by a row of large, deeply set windows.

The annex includes two new courtrooms on the fourth floor, and space for additional courtrooms on the second floor. The courtrooms are notable for their spatial design. Each courtroom is organized along an implied axis connecting the jury deliberation room, judge's bench, courtroom entrance, and major features in the public atrium. Fully accessible witness and jury boxes are set to one side. Clerestory windows above the jury box introduce daylight into the courtrooms.

A glass-and-steel atrium connects the 1931 building to the 1999 annex. The atrium is highlighted by an art glass installation by artist Paul Housberg, which was commissioned under GSA's Art in Architecture program. The program empowers the nation's leading artists to create new works of art for federal buildings. The artist worked with GSA staff, project architects, and the community to create artwork integrated into the building's design. Housberg's colored glass wall, entitled Lightfall, consists of backlit twelve-inch by twenty-inch glass blocks.

Sportspeople from Val-d'OiseHubert Joseph Latham (13 September 1932 – 22 May 2017) was an English cricketer who played first-class cricket in 10 matches for Warwickshire between 1955 and 1959. He was born in Winson Green, Birmingham. 

Latham was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler who played in first-class cricket as an amateur. He appeared in a couple of Warwickshire's less important first-class fixtures in 1955 and 1956, and was picked for another one of these non-County Championship games, against the Combined Services cricket team, early in the 1958 season: he took six second-innings wickets against what was a county-standard services team. He remained in the Warwickshire side for the six County Championship matches across May 1958 and took a few wickets in all of them, but then left the team and did not reappear, except in a single non-Championship game 14 months later in July 1959. He also appeared in occasional second eleven matches through to 1964.

18,81,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type5,"Dunaff () is a townland in the Urris Valley, located in the North-West corner of the Inishowen Peninsula.

It is in the Electoral Division of Dunaff, in Civil Parish of Clonmany, in the Barony of Inishowen East, in County Donegal. It borders the following other townlands: Kinnea to the east; Lenan to the south; Letter to the east and Urrismenagh to the south. It has four subtownlands; Tirnasligo, Ballynacarla and Bulloor.

Dunaff has an area of 526.72 hectares (1301.55 acres).

History 
Ireland's oldest Neolithic campsite is located in Dunaff Bay. It lies at the mouth of Loch Swilly, between the cliffs of Dunaff Head to the north and Lenan Head to the south. The site contained many early Irish Mesolithic artifacts, including unabraded flints comprising a few leaf-shaped flakes, blade-like flakes and a large amount of related Neolithic waste material. The location is regarded as an ""industrial site"" producing material associated with the so-called Early Larnian tradition. There is no evidence of a permanent settlement at the site.

In the early 20th century, Dunaff Head the location of a local regatta. Both sailing boats and rowing boats from local villages competed in races.

Fishing 
During the 19th Century, residents supplemented their income through fishing.  A Royal Commission on the State of Irish Fishing, published in 1837, described the boats in Dunaff as being in ""generally a very bad condition"" with the ""fishermen being too poor to keep (their boats) seaworthy"".

Disasters at sea 
The coastline around Dunaff is treacherous.  As a consequence, the townland has a long history of accidents and disasters related to the sea.
 HMS Saldanah ran aground on the evening of 4 December 1811 with the loss of 253 lives.
In January 1832, six fishermen were drowned off Dunaff Head. Their boat capsized after it was hit by a heavy wave.
 On 18 May 1839 the schooner Janet was wrecked near Dunaff Head, while sailing from Killala to Liverpool.
 In March 1841, the schooner Mary Hamilton struck the rocks around Dunaff Head, and foundered. The vessel was registered in Glasgow and was sailing from Liverpool to Donegal.
On 2 April 1850, a ship called Mars sank off Dunaff head. All the crew were rescued.
 A fleet of fishing vessels set sail from Dunaff Bay in January 1890. The fleet encountered a storm and one of the boats foundered.  The nine men on board were drowned.
 In April 1894, five survivors from the wreck of Ocean Witch arrived in an open boat at Dunaff Head. Captain Holden, the ship's mate and three seamen abandoned the schooner when it foundered off Eagle Island. The vessel was bound from Plymouth to Limerick.
 In March 1917, two local farmers William Kearney and Con Kelly were swept to sea while trying to recover pieces of wreckage from the rocks around Dunaff Head during a gale.
In July 1957,  the body of  Thomas Porter of Inch Island was discovered in the sea near Dunaff.  He was one of four fishermen who died when their boat was lost in a storm near Loch Swilley.
In June 1975. twelve anglers were rescued by the Irish Navy, when their boat ran into trouble just off Dunaff Head.

Post Office Robbery 
In January 1923, the Dunaff Post Office was robbed by three armed men.   The robbers entered the premises and overpowered the occupants, taking away £100. Three local men were later arrested.

Poiten production 
The relatively remote location of the townland provided significant cover for producers of illicit alcohol. In particular, the Dunaff hills were a major site of production.  As a consequence, homes in the townland were subjected to regular rates by the authorities both before and after independence.

 In September 1926, the Garda seized 70 gallons of wash, an intermediate product of Poitin in a cave on Dunaff hill.  
A Dunaff farmer by the name of Duffy was prosecuted in April 1928 for producing poitin.

Places of Interest 
 Dunaff Hill - A mountain with an elevation of 210 meters (689 feet). Its coordinates are 55.2783° North and 7.5153° West.  This hill is hemmed in by Dunaff Bay to the south and by Rocktown Bay to the north, which in turn creates the Dunaff Headland. This headland has a 4 kilometer stretch of very exposed coast line running its circumference to a high point of 220 meters. 
 Bothanvarra - A 70m high chubby Matterhorn shaped sea stack that sits just beyond Dunaff head.  Access to Bothanvarra is by 1.5km sea passage from Rocktown Bay to the north or by descending the steep vegetated gully 500 meters to the south of the stack. Both methods of approach are quite dangerous and require a very calm sea state. 
 Dunaff Head - A promontory that sits on the eastern entrance of Loch Swilly.  The cliffs on the north side rise perpendicularly to a height of 600 feet.

21,84,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type5,"The purple-bearded bee-eater or Celebes bee-eater (Meropogon forsteni) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family Meropidae.  It is an endemic resident on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. This species is often seen in clearings inside dense forest.

The purple-bearded bee-eater is the only member of the genus Meropogon. Its scientific name commemorates Eltio Alegondas Forsten (1811–1843) who collected in the East Indies between 1838 and 1842.

Description
The purple-bearded bee-eater is a colourful long bird with a long tail, long slender decurved beak and rather rounded wings. It is 25–26 cm (10 inches) long, excluding 6 cm (21/2 inches) of tail streamers.

The adult male has a purple head, face, “beard” (long hanging throat feathers), breast and upper belly. The upperparts, wings and tail are green, apart from a reddish-brown nape,  and the central tail feathers are elongated as streamers. The lower belly is reddish-brown and the underside of the tail is chestnut.

The adult female is similar, but the forebelly is reddish-brown, not purple. Young birds have a green crown and nape, dusky face and bluish beard. They lack the elongated central tail feathers of the adult.

The call is a quiet high-pitched szit or peep.

Behaviour
The purple-bearded bee-eater undertakes seasonal movements, breeding inland in the dry season, and moving to the coast in the rainy season. Like other bee-eaters it nests in burrows up to 90 cm long tunnelled into the side of sandy river banks, cliffs and cuttings, but does not form colonies.

The purple-bearded bee-eater, again like its relatives, eats  insects, including bees, wasps and  dragonflies and beetles, which are caught in flight. This species hunts alone or in pairs, rather than in flocks, and sits on a favoured perch for long periods, twisting its head with its beard flattened or plumped, and wagging its tail back and forth before sallying after passing prey.

purple-bearded bee-eaterThe Portrait of Giovanni de' Medici as a Child (c. 1545) is an oil on panel painting by the Florentine artist Agnolo Bronzino. It is currently located at the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.

Background
This portrait uses oil paint on panel and portrays Giovanni di Cosimo de' Medici. It was painted for his father, Cosimo I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Bronzino was the official painter of the Medici Court from 1532 and did many portraits of Duke Cosimo I and his family. Cosimo had his portrait done by Bronzino around 1545, the Portrait of Cosimo I de’ Medici. Giovanni and his mother Eleonora of Toledo were the subjects of another portrait by Bronzino from around 1545 or 1546, the Portrait of Eleonora of Toledo and Her Son.

Description and Analysis
An extended title for this portrait is the Portrait of Giovanni de’ Medici as a Child holding a Goldfinch. It was painted sometime between 1544 and 1545, based on the child's age. Giovanni was born in the September 1543 and this portrait depicts him at the age of eighteen months. He is wearing a pink doublet, which is painted with high detail. He holds a goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) in his hand, which is a Christian symbol, because the goldfinch eats thistle seed and so is associated with Christ’s Crown of Thorns and the Passion. It appears in religious paintings to represent the knowledge of the future Crucifixion. Around his neck, he wears a gold chain with a coral and other charms. It was believed that coral could protect children from harm.

Unlike Bronzino's other portraits that depict the sitters viewing the world with a distant, aristocratic disdain, Giovanni's portrait is animated and engaging. The portraits of Cosimo's other children are represented with the same emotionless faces as the adults. They do not show any of the children's personality and are very serious. Most of the portraits have the sitter with the body almost face-on, with a slight three-quarter turn of the head to the left. The sitter looks at the  viewer and the dark backgrounds are unspecific. Giovanni's portrait is quite different. It depicts an almost 2-year-old child cheerfully and realistically, with an accurate description of the morphology of a young child. Unlike the portraits of the duke's other sons, it is cropped above the knee and the body is presented almost frontally with a slight turn to our left. The child is seated on dark-brown bench, with a dark green background that contrasts well with his pink clothes that are the same color as his coral charm. It is a natural depiction of early childhood with his chubby face and fingers. Two of his baby teeth are peeping out, and he has tufts of fine hair that all add to his delightful representation. His active expression is that of a young child as he smiles and gazes out at the viewer. Giovanni was the fourth and youngest child of Cosimo, and was portrayed differently from his brothers because his father had different goals for his life. Years later, after Giovanni became a cardinal at the age of seventeen, he had Bronzino paint an allegorical portrait titled Portrait of Giovanni de’ Medici as St. John the Baptist, which was painted between 1560 and 1562.

It was said a month after he was born, he was “beautiful and plump” (bello e grasso) and “like an angel from paradise”. In 1547, he was described as “the handsomest and happiest boy that ever was…” which certainly fits the portrayal of his character in this charming portrait.

48,86,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type9,"Lil Mariko is the debut EP by American singer Lil Mariko, independently released on March 18, 2021. It was produced by Mariko's boyfriend and creative partner Jared Soule, otherwise known as Full Tac.

Background and promotion
The first single that would later be compiled in the EP was ""Don't Touch"" featuring Full Tac, released on April 21, 2020. The second, ""Shiny"" also featuring Full Tac was released on September 4, 2020. A music video followed on March 20, 2021, two days after the EP's release.

On April 3, Lil Mariko performed for Chester Lockhart's Chester's Bday Party live-streamed event alongside Full Tac. The event also encouraged donations to The Okra Project and Red Canary Song.

Composition and writing
The main genres of Lil Mariko are hyperpop and trap metal.

The first track on the EP, ""Hi, I'm a Slut"" conveys sex positivity as a reclamation and response to ""slut-shaming"". It features heavy bass and electronic synths taking elements from both trap and pop. The track was also loosely compared to 100 Gecs, Doja Cat, and Babymetal. The second track, ""Don't Touch"" featuring Full Tac, alternates between synth-filled choruses and Mariko's screams. Lyrically, the track describes Lil Mariko's disdain for men who sexually harass women or stare at them for too long. Mariko's character fully portrays a personality set on spontaneous violence. ""100 Dicks"" criticized men who send unsolicited dick pics to women. The track follows the standard hyperpop flow. The next track, ""I'm Baby"" contains some minor influences from deathcore. Mainly the fact that has a heavier sound than its predecessors, and features increasingly guttural vocals. The track ""Disgusting"" features guest vocals from Zheani. The sixth track, ""Shiny"" also featuring Full Tac was described in a similar vain to the previous. Being a sex positive, gender equalizing track full of energy. Closing track ""Catboys"" is an fantasied ode to pegging Catboys. Mariko commented that she wanted to combine something like catboys and drill music.

Critical reception

The EP received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Mariko's vocal performance and production, but criticism aimed at some tracks not living up to the hype as the full project intended to be. The Cascade praised many of the tracks on the EP, however noted that ""I'm Baby"" and ""Catboys"" fell short of the hype. The student newspaper The Globe gave the EP a positive 4-out-of-5 rating. Afonso Marques of the Portuguese University of Minho's online student journal ComUM gave it a rating of 6-out-of-10, although positive, the tracks ""100 Dicks"" and ""Disgusting"" were seen as the EP's weaknesses. A review from Working Class Whole also positively rated the EP, noting that ""Lil Mariko juxtaposes her cutesy, saccharine singing with monstrous metal screaming in a way that makes sense and does not feel out of place or too unexpected."" and recommended the EP for both fans of pop and metal. Bradley Timm of TuneChamber.com gave a positive review and cited ""Lil Mariko's tracks lack in substance are made up for in legitimately catchy – if sporadically abrasive – productions."" and hoped her next release would improve of her flaws.

49,87,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type1,"Hunas were a tribe close to Himalayas that, because of limited interaction with Indian kingdoms, were mentioned in the epic Mahabharata. They belonged to the Xinjiang province of China, east of Jammu-Kashmir. However, they were nomadic people who changed their settlements from time to time.

References in Mahabharata

Huna mentioned as a kingdom of Ancient India (Bharata Varsha) 

Among the tribes of the north are the Mlecchas, and the Kruras, the Yavanas, the Chinas, the Kambojas, the Darunas, and many Mleccha tribes; the Sukritvahas, the Kulatthas, the Hunas, and the Parasikas; the Ramanas, and the Dasamalikas. (6,9).

According to Dr V. A. Smith, this verse of Mahabharata is reminiscent of the period (4th/5th century AD)  when the Hunas first came into contact with the Sassanians dynasty of Persia (See: Early History of India, p 339, Dr V. A. Smith; See also Early Empire of Central Asia, W. M. McGovern).

The origin myth of Huna tribe 

Mahabharata links the origin of Hunas with sage Vasishta. Viswamitra attacked the cow of Vasishta. Then many armies emerged for the protection of that cow and they attacked the armies of Viswamitra. Thus this war was fought with the tribes allied with Vasishta for their own land. Other tribes that were mentioned along with the Hunas in this incident were Sakas, Yavanas, Savaras, Savaras, Paundras and Kiratas, and the barbarous tribes of Khasas, Chivukas, Pulindas, Chinas and numerous other Mlechchhas. (1,177)

From the list it seems that it is a compiled list of tribes formerly unknown to the Vedic Kingdoms.

The above story of Mahabharata differs somewhat from the Shavala cow story of Valmiki Ramayana. According to Valmiki Ramayana which is older than the Mahabharata, the list of the tribes connected with Vasishtha-Vishwamitra war over the possession of Shavala/Kamdhenu cow includes the Kambojas, Pahlavas, Yavanas, Shakas, Mlecchas, Haritas, Kiratas etc [Ramayana, Bala Kanda, 55.1-4]. Ramayana list being older is often taken more authentic of the two lists.

Role in Kurukshetra War 

Yudhishthira, followed by the Patachcharas, the Hunas, the Pauravakas and the Nishadas, the Pisachas, with the Kundavishas, and the Mandakas, the Ladakas (Ladakh), the Tanganas, and the Uddras, the Saravas, the Tumbhumas, the Vatsas and the Nakulas stood in the two wings of the battle-array named Krauncharuma, formed by the Pandava generalissimo, Dhristadyumna, on the second day of the Kurukshetra War.

It represents Azerbaijan in international futsal competitions such as the FIFA Futsal World Cup and the European Championships. They are ranked 12th in the world, the highest-ranking team from Caucasus in the World Rankings.They are also ranked 7th in Europe on 10 August 2021.

Azerbaijan had never qualified for the FIFA Futsal World Cup until 2016, but they have participated in the last five editions of the European Championship.

History

Recently
Azerbaijan's first appearance at the big level came during the 2010 UEFA Futsal Championship. They were unbeaten in qualifying and finished second to Portugal in their group, and only then after conceding a late equalizer against the 2007 semi-finalists. Alesio has put together a potent blend of naturalized South Americans and local talent like Vitaliy Borisov and the Brazilian coach and much of the Azerbaijan squad are involved with champion club Araz Naxçivan, who in November won through to this spring's four-team UEFA Futsal Cup finals. Despite finishing in fourth place, Azerbaijan's finals run was the best showing by a debutant since the inaugural UEFA Futsal Championship tournament. Azerbaijan's Biro Jade won the Golden Boot award as joint top scorer with five goals.

European national futsal teams
NationalThe Stouffville Spirit are a Junior ""A"" ice hockey team from Whitchurch–Stouffville, Ontario, Canada. The Stouffville Spirit are members of the Central Canadian Hockey League of the Ontario Hockey Association.

History
From 1970 until 1984, the Stouffville Clippers were members of the Central Junior C Hockey League.  From 1984 until 1995, the team was on a long hiatus.  The Clippers were brought back in 1995, changed their name to the Spirit a season later, and have been members of the OPJHL ever since.
Junior hockey has a long and storied history in Stouffville.

The 1947 Stouffville Red Wings won an OHA championship. Junior hockey was popular in Stouffville through the 1960s, right into the early 1980s.

The Spirit was founded in 1995. George Stavro, who was granted the franchise by the Ontario Hockey Association, was the team's first coach and general manager. Junior hockey hadn't been played in Stouffville since 1984, when the OHA's junior C Stouffville Clippers folded.

But Stavro didn't last a full season in the Provincial Junior A Hockey League.

In mid-season, he sold the franchise to Stouffville businessman Ed Hakonson, who had tried to obtain a junior A franchise for Stouffville earlier in the '90s. Former Stouffville minor official Wally Crowder was named general manager, and Steve Sedore of Georgina head coach.

The Spirit struggled on and off the ice over the first three seasons. Sedore was replaced as coach by Stouffville minor hockey grad Dan Larmer. Larmer played junior hockey in southern Ontario and college hockey at Mercyhurst in Pennsylvania, before a brief pro career.

A move of home games at the Whitchurch-Stouffville Recreation Complex, from Saturday nights to Thursdays, improved attendance. But the Spirit didn't make the playoffs in its first three seasons.

A new regime took over Spirit hockey operations in 1998. New Spirit general manager Dieter Schmidt had been manager and head coach Brian Perrin was associate coach with the successful Newmarket Hurricanes' organization, before accepting promotions in Stouffville.

The Spirit has made the playoffs ever since. Its regular season record has improved annually.

Players have advanced to college and major junior hockey since Year 1 of the Spirit.

Hakonson sold shares in the hockey club to Stouffville-area resident Zeev Werek and Larry Goldberg in 1999, then sold the rest of the team to Werek and Goldberg a year later. David Laren joined the Spirit in 2002 as an equal partner. Goldberg left the group in 2005.

Schmidt retired as GM after the 2000-2001 season. His replacement is Stouffville native Ken Burrows, who in 10 years with the Spirit has been vice-president of hockey, assistant coach and scout.

A volunteer board of directors oversees the operation of the Spirit.

The Spirit is proud to be affiliated with the Whitchurch-Stouffville Minor Hockey Association and the Uxbridge Bruins Junior C Hockey Club.

The series focuses on two beautiful, young TV news reporters competing for the top position at the network they work for. It aired on MBC from April 26 to July 6, 2000, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 (KST) for 20 episodes.

Besides sharing a title and the premise of female rivalry, this drama has nothing to do with the film starring Bette Davis.

Plot
Jin Sun-mi (Chae Rim) is a lovely college student who lives with her upper-middle-class widowed father. She has a happy childhood with her best friend Kim Woo-jin (Han Jae-suk). Life changes radically for Sun-mi when her father decides to support Heo Young-mi (Kim So-yeon), a beautiful girl the same age as Sun-mi.

Young-mi became an orphan when her father, an alcoholic who frequently abused her, dies in an accident while working for Mr. Jin's (Sun-mi's father) construction company. Young-mi has grown up in poverty, but she is not a humble person. She's arrogant, greedy and full of resentment. She initially becomes friends with Sun-mi, but eventually envies her for all she is and has, even Woo-jin's love.

Young-mi becomes Sun-mi's rival in every aspect of her life. First, Young-mi steals Woo-jin from Sun-mi, then tries to take over her job at a very important TV network as they both dream to be famous news anchorwomen. She finally turns her eyes on Sun-mi's new boyfriend, Hyung-chul (Jang Dong-gun), one of the network's top executives, whom Sun-mi met during a trip to London. However, Hyung-chul's love for Sun-mi is stronger than Young-mi's estimation. Meanwhile, Woo-jin suffers of a broken heart as Young-mi makes his life miserable and finally dumps him so she can chase Hyung-chul, even though it hurts her just as much since she does not love him and is only after him for her career's sake.

The climax of the plot comes when a former lover of Young-mi appears and threatens to reveal her deepest secret should she not return to him: a dark past as a prostitute. Since the gangster did not succeed in his attempts, he decides to kill Young-mi. Woo-jin dies while saving her life. However, all of Young-mi's treachery is exposed. Losing everything and heartbroken because of Woo-jin's death, she attempts to commit suicide, but her efforts are frustrated when she is found unconscious by a group of nuns on the shore of the Han River. When Young-mi wakes up, she suffers from amnesia and has lost almost all memories of her past.

The drama ends with a happy reconciliation between Young-mi and Sun-mi, who cries beside Young-mi, forgiving her for the misunderstandings between them since they met. Finally, Hyung-chul swears eternal love and proposes to Sun-mi right in the middle of a street, asking her not to move to London.

The bullrout has a large head, and seven spines on the operculum. It has a big mouth with a protruding lower jaw. The spinous dorsal fin is slightly concave posteriorly and the last soft dorsal ray is attached by a membrane to the caudal peduncle. The body is covered with small scales, but the head is scaleless. Its colouration is variable from pale yellowish to dark brown, with blotches and marbling of dark brown, red-brown, grey, or black. These markings sometimes form broad, irregular bands. Bullrout may grow up to 30 cm in size, but are more commonly found at the 20-cm size.

Danger to humans and first aid
The dorsal, anal, and pelvic spines on a bullrout have venom glands on them, and should be handled with extreme care
. A puncture wound from one of these spines is excruciatingly painful. For immediate relief of pain associated with the sting of a bullrout, immerse the affected area in hot water.

46,95,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type2,"The Florentine citron – citron hybrid of Florence () – is a very fragrant citrus fruit, which is named after its most known origin of cultivation. Its scientific name is Citrus × limonimedica 'Florentina' Lush.

Source and genetics
This variety or hybrid originated in Italian Renaissance gardens. Today it is considered to be a lemon × citron hybrid.

It's known to be one parent of the Bizzaria chimaera.

History and uses

It was first described by Johann Christoph Volkamer in his  Nürnbergische Hesperides, who gave a detailed account for original citrus types, mutations and hybrids, along with professional illustrations. He has many illustrations of the Florentine citron growing by itself, or on the Bizzaria tree. Those illustrations resemble the way it looks today.

He also writes that it has a very pleasant fragrance, similar to the Greek citron.

The most popular Italian variety, namely the Genoese citron, was well respected and praised by Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities.

Life and career
Smith was born in Newcastle upon Tyne. He played local football for St Peter's Albion before beginning a tour of the Football League. After single seasons with Merthyr Town, Hull City, Hartlepools United and Merthyr Town again, before joining Cardiff City in 1929, where he spent three seasons disrupted by injury. In 1929, he signed for Brighton & Hove Albion, where he established himself as a first-team regular, averaging 40 league matches a season over an eight-year spell. After a season with Crystal Palace without a league appearance, he moved into non-league football with Gloucester City, where he acted as player-coach. Smith died in Brighton in 1978 at the age of 77.

Invertebrates of Southeast AsiaAspilia mossambicensis also known as Wild sunflower is a medicinally useful herbaceous plant of the family Compositae (Asteraceae). It is widespread with an anthropogenic distribution in central and Eastern tropical Africa from Ethiopia, through East Africa, the Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa. 

A. mossambicensis is used by herbalists and local people to treat such ailments and conditions as malaria, bacterial infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is also used to reduce menstrual cramps as well as a uterotonic able to induce uterine contraction and labour in confinements. This species is used together with the Neem tree to control the breeding cycles of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Drugs extracted from the two species inhibit early maturing and reproduction of the fish, countering problems raised by having populations of diverse ages in commercial breeding ponds.

Phytochemical and anti-microbial properties
Two powerful stimulators of uterine contraction, the diterpenes kaurenoic and grandiflorenic acids, were found in the leaves of Aspilia mossambicensis. This lends credence to the idea that wild chimpanzees consume leaves of Aspilia species because of their pharmacological properties and could shed light on female chimpanzees' consuming such leaves more frequently than do males. Substantial amounts of thiarubrines, antifungal and nematocidal dithianes, were found in roots of plants growing throughout chimpanzee habitats.

Cities and towns in LombardyThe bomb pulse is the sudden increase of carbon-14 (14C) in the Earth's atmosphere due to the hundreds of aboveground nuclear bombs tests that started in 1945 and intensified after 1950 until 1963, when the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. These hundreds of blasts were followed by a doubling of the relative concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. We discuss “relative concentration”, because measurements of 14C levels by mass spectrometers are most accurately made by comparison to another carbon isotope, often the common isotope 12C.  Isotope abundance ratios are not only more easily measured, they are what 14C carbon daters want, since it is the fraction of carbon in a sample that is 14C, not the absolute concentration, that is of interest in dating measurements.  The figure shows how the fraction of carbon in the atmosphere that is 14C, of order only a part per trillion, has changed over the past several decades following the bomb tests.  Because 12C concentration has increased by about 30% over the past fifty years, the fact that “pMC”, measuring the isotope ratio, has returned (almost) to its 1955 value, means that 14C concentration in the atmosphere remains some 30% higher than it once was. Carbon-14, the radioisotope of carbon, is naturally developed in trace amounts in the atmosphere and it can be detected in all living organisms. Carbon of all types is continually used to form the molecules of the cells of organisms. Doubling of the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere is reflected in the tissues and cells of all organisms that lived around the period of nuclear testing. This property has many applications in the fields of biology and forensics.

Background 
The radioisotope carbon-14 is constantly formed from nitrogen-14 (14N) in the higher atmosphere by incoming cosmic rays which generate neutrons. These neutrons collide with 14N to produce 14C which then combines with oxygen to form 14CO2. This radioactive CO2 spreads through the lower atmosphere and the oceans where it is absorbed by the plants and the animals that eat the plants. The radioisotope 14C thus becomes part of the biosphere so that all living organisms contain a certain amount of 14C. Nuclear testing caused a rapid increase in atmospheric 14C (see figure), since the explosion of an atomic bomb also creates neutrons which collide again with 14N and produce 14C. Since the ban on nuclear testing in 1963, atmospheric 14C relative concentration is slowly decreasing at a pace of 4% annually. This continuous decrease permits scientists to determine among others the age of deceased people and allows them to study cell activity in tissues. By measuring the amount of 14C in a population of cells and comparing that to the amount of 14C in the atmosphere during or after the bomb pulse, scientists can estimate when the cells were created and how often they've turned over since then.

Difference with classical radiocarbon dating 
Radiocarbon dating has been used since 1946 to determine the age of organic material as old as 50,000 years. As the organism dies, the exchange of 14C with the environment ceases and the incorporated 14C decays. Given the steady decay of radioisotopes (the half-life of 14C is about 5,730 years), the relative amount of 14C left in the dead organism can be used to calculate how long ago it died. Bomb pulse dating should be considered a special form of carbon dating. As discussed above and in the Radiolab episode, Elements (section 'Carbon'),  in bomb pulse dating the slow absorption of atmospheric 14C by the biosphere, can be considered as a chronometer. Starting from the pulse around the years 1963 (see figure), atmospheric radiocarbon relative abundance decreased by about 4% a year. So in bomb pulse dating it is the relative amount of 14C in the atmosphere that is decreasing and not the amount of 14C in a dead organisms, as is the case in classical radiocarbon dating. This decrease in atmospheric 14C can be measured in cells and tissues and has permitted scientists to determine the age of individual cells and of deceased people. These applications are very similar to the experiments conducted with pulse-chase analysis in which cellular processes are examined over time by exposing the cells to a labeled compound (pulse) and then to the same compound in an unlabeled form (chase). Radioactivity is a commonly used label in these experiments. An important difference between pulse-chase analysis and bomb-pulse dating is the absence of the chase in the latter.

Around the year 2030 the bomb pulse will die out. Every organism born after this will not bear detectable bomb pulse traces and their cells cannot be dated in this way. Radioactive pulses cannot ethically be administered to people just to study the turnover of their cells so the bomb pulse results may be considered as a useful side effect of nuclear testing.

Applications 
The fact that cells and tissues reflect the doubling of 14C in the atmosphere during and after nuclear testing, has been of great use for several biological studies, for forensics and even for the determination of the year in which certain wine was produced.

Biology 
Biological studies carried out by Kirsty Spalding demonstrated that neuronal cells are essentially static and do not regenerate during life. She also showed that the number of fat cells is set during childhood and adolescence. Considering the amount of 14C present in DNA she could establish that 10% of fat cells are renewed annually. The radiocarbon bomb pulse has been used to validate otolith annuli (ages scored from otolith sections) across several fish species including the freshwater drum, lake sturgeon, pallid sturgeon, bigmouth buffalo, arctic salmonids, Pristipomoides filamentosus, several reef fishes, among numerous other validated freshwater and marine species. The precision for bomb radiocarbon age validation is typically within +/- 2 years because the rise period (1956-1960) is so steep. The bomb pulse has also been used to estimate (not validate) the age of Greenland sharks by measuring the incorporation of 14C in the eye lens during development. After having determined the age and measured the length of sharks born around the bomb pulse, it was possible to create a mathematical model in which length and age of the sharks were correlated in order to deduce the age of the larger sharks. The study showed that the Greenland shark, with an age of 392 +/- 120 years, is the oldest known vertebrate.

Forensics 
At the moment of death, carbon uptake is ended. Considering that tissue that contained the bomb pulse 14C was rapidly diminishing with a rate of 4% per year, it has been possible to establish the time of death of two women in a court case by examining tissues with a rapid turnover.  Another important application has been the identification of victims of the Southeast Asian tsunami 2004 by examining their teeth.

Carbon Transport Modeling 
The perturbation in atmospheric 14C from the bomb testing was an opportunity to validate atmospheric transport models, and to study the movement of carbon between the atmosphere and oceanic or terrestrial sinks.

Other 
Atmospheric bomb 14C has been used to validate tree ring ages and to date recent trees that have no annual growth rings.

February 2017 sports events in CanadaSir Jacob Charles Vouza, , KPM (c. 1892 – 15 March 1984) was a native police officer of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, who served with the United States Marine Corps in the Guadalcanal campaign during World War II.

Early life

Vouza was born in Tasimboko, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, and educated at the South Seas Evangelical Mission School there. In 1916 he joined the Solomon Islands Protectorate Armed Constabulary. He retired in 1941, after 25 years of service, at the rank of Sergeant Major.

World War II service

In mid-1942, Japanese forces invaded Guadalcanal. Vouza returned to active duty with the British forces and volunteered to work with the Coastwatchers. A Scotsman, Major Martin Clemens, a former British Solomon Islands Protectorate District Officer, was the officer in charge of SgtMaj Vouza's brigade of native scouts. Vouza's ability as a scout had already been established when the US 1st Marine Division landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. That same day, Vouza rescued an aviator from USS Wasp who was shot down in Japanese-held territory. He guided the pilot to American lines, where he met the Marines for the first time.

Vouza then volunteered to scout behind enemy lines. On 20 August, while scouting for suspected Japanese outposts, Vouza was captured by men of the Ichiki Detachment, a battalion-strength force of the Japanese 28th Infantry Regiment. Having found a small American flag in Vouza's loincloth, the Japanese tied him to a tree and tortured him for information about Allied forces. Vouza was questioned for hours, but refused to talk. He was then bayoneted in both of his arms, throat, shoulder, face, and stomach, and left to die.

After his captors departed, he freed himself by chewing through the ropes with his teeth, and made his way through the miles of jungle to American lines. Before accepting medical attention from Lt. Col. Stanley Radzyminski MD, he gasped a warning to Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock, whose 2nd Battalion 1st Marines held the defences at the Ilu River mouth. Vouza told him that an estimated 250 to 500 Japanese soldiers were coming to attack his position in any minute. This warning gave the Marines the brief but precious time of about 10 minutes to prepare their defences along the Ilu river. The subsequent Battle of the Tenaru was a clear victory for the Marines.

After spending 12 days in the hospital and receiving  of blood, Vouza returned to duty as the chief scout for the Marines. He accompanied Lieutenant Colonel Evans F. Carlson and the 2nd Raider Battalion on their 30-day raid behind enemy lines.

Awards

Sergeant Major Vouza was highly decorated for his World War II service. The Silver Star was presented to him personally by Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, commanding general of the 1st Marine Division, for refusing to give information under Japanese torture. He also was awarded the Legion of Merit for outstanding service with the 2nd Raider Battalion during November and December 1942, and was made an honorary Sergeant Major in the Marine Corps. From the British government, he received the George Medal for gallant conduct and exceptional devotion to duty and the Police Long Service Medal and, in 1957, was appointed an MBE for public services in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. In 1979, he was elevated to the KBE for outstanding services to his country and local community.

After the war

After the war, Vouza continued to serve his fellow islanders. He was appointed district headman in 1949, and was president of the Guadalcanal Council from 1952 to 1958. He was a member of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Advisory Council from 1950 to 1960.

He made many friends during his association with the Marine Corps, and Marines frequently visited him on Guadalcanal. In 1968, Vouza visited the United States as the honoured guest of the 1st Marine Division Association. He wore his Marine Corps tunic until his death on 15 March 1984, and was buried in it.

Memorial

A monument in his honour stands in front of the police headquarters building in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands.

Burl Ives plays a small role and sings the following songs on the soundtrack: ""A Stranger in Town,"" ""The Sun's Shining Warm,"" and ""A Man Can't Grow Old.""

Plot
Two soldiers have been robbed and murdered while guarding a shipment of gold. Into town rides Haven (Dick Powell), a military intelligence officer traveling incognito. When he rides into town, the hotel clerk (Burl Ives) is sitting at the front desk, playing his guitar and singing   “a man can't grow old where there's women and gold,” segueing the lyrics into a clear  warning to leave town.

A beautiful saloon singer (Jane Greer) catches Haven's eye. After he meets Mrs. Caslon (Agnes Moorehead), who owns the gold mine, Haven hears that someone called ""Charlie"" is the brains behind the scene. He finds out to his surprise that Charlie is the singer.

Charlie's lawyer, Bristow (Raymond Burr), is $6,000 in her debt and therefore might be involved in the gold theft. Haven beats up Charlie's saloon bouncer in a fight and is offered a job as transport chief for the gold. Charlie's friend, Prince (Gordon Oliver), meanwhile, is growing jealous of her interest in Haven.

While transporting a shipment of gold, the man riding shotgun, Goddard (Regis Toomey), is killed and Haven knocked cold. When he comes to, he manages to track, catch and kill the robber carrying the gold. He shoos away the dead man's horses and follows them to their home stable, at the sawmill owned by Charlie. Haven pretends to be an ignorant hand working for Charlie, and is tasked with transporting the stolen gold in the horses' saddlebags back to town to Charlie and Prince.

He hides the gold, and confronts Prince and Charlie. After some to-ing and fro-ing with the gold and an affidavit dictated to Bristow by Haven, Charlie convinces Bristow that he ought to confront Haven. Haven convinces him rather that he is the next target of Prince and Charlie as he knows too much. Bristow, terrified, tries to get away but is shot by Prince. Haven is pinned down, but after persuading the sheriff to arrest him for the crime, Haven escapes, and learns that Charlie's men plan to disguise themselves as soldiers to steal more of Mrs. Caslon's gold.

He foils this plot, then arrives back at the saloon, to arrest Charlie, but also because he is in love with her. Prince sneaks up intending to shoot Haven, but his bullet hits Charlie instead. Haven kills Prince. Before she dies, Charlie  tells Haven that she loves him, and Haven confesses his love for her.

Haven rides away as Burl Ives sings  “a man can't grow old where there's women and gold.”

Manison was born in Tennant Creek, and she later studied journalism and public relations at Curtin University in Perth. Prior to entering politics, she worked as human resources and communications manager for MG Kailis Group and as a media advisor to former Labor leaders Paul Henderson and Delia Lawrie.

She was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 by-election after the resignation of former Chief Minister Paul Henderson. On 18 February 2013, opposition leader Delia Lawrie appointed Manison to the Labor frontbench in the portfolios of Public Employment and Public Housing. Manison was later promoted to Health, Essential Services, Statehood, Multicultural Affairs, Young Territorians and Senior Territorians portfolios.

Following Labor's victory at the 2016 election, Manison was sworn in as Treasurer of the Northern Territory on 31 August, replacing former Chief Minister Adam Giles.

67,105,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type3,"Tahlequah (born  1998), also known as J35, is a killer whale of the Southern Resident community in the northwestern  Pacific Ocean. She has given birth to three known offspring, a male in 2010, a female in 2018, and another male in 2020. Her second calf died shortly after birth and J35 carried her body for 17 days in an apparent show of grief that attracted international attention.

Name
J35 was given the name Tahlequah by The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, Washington, as part of their Adopt-a-Whale outreach program. One of her adopters was Malia Obama, daughter of former United States President Barack Obama.

Life
J35 was born in 1998 to J17 (Princess Angeline), a member of the J pod of the Southern Resident community, and has two living siblings. J35's first calf, a male named J47 (Notch), was born in 2010, and researchers speculated that she miscarried another calf in the mid-2010s. After the death of her sister J28 (Polaris) in 2016, J35 cared for her two offspring, until one, that was still milk-dependent, starved to death.

Her second calf, a female, was born on July 24, 2018, off Victoria, British Columbia; she was alive, but died within a half-hour of her birth. The infant population and health of the Southern Residents community had declined in the early 21st century, due in part to a smaller supply of Chinook salmon and the presence of polluting substances in the Salish Sea.

J35 carried the calf's body on her rostrum while following the pod around the San Juan Islands and interior waters of British Columbia over the following two weeks. Whale researchers noted that J35 looked emaciated and other pod members were showing concern for her health. After the seventh day, other members began taking turns floating the calf while allowing J35 to rest. By the ninth day, the calf had shown signs of visible decomposition and was becoming harder to carry. The pod disappeared for several days in early August, but were spotted on August 8, with J35 still carrying her calf after 16 days. By the following day, after  of swimming, J35 released the calf and rejoined the J pod with no apparent signs of malnutrition or ill health.

Her unusually long period of grieving attracted international attention and an outpouring of sympathy, comparing her actions to that of a human mother. The ongoing crisis within the Southern Residents community prompted calls for intervention, including dam removals and the increased killing of sea lions who interfere with salmon growth in the Columbia River. Washington Governor Jay Inslee stated that he supported new measures to address orca-related issues and would work with state and federal officials to find short-term solutions.

In July 2020, a drone survey of the J, K, and L pods revealed that J35 showed signs of an active pregnancy. She gave birth to a male calf, named J57 by the Center for Whale Research, on September 5 near the San Juan Islands.

91,106,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type9,"Sergei Appolinarievich Gerasimov (; 21 May 1906 – 26 November 1985) was a Soviet film director and screenwriter. The oldest film school in the world, the VGIK, bears his name.

Gerasimov started his film industry career as an actor in 1924. At first he appeared in Kozintsev and Trauberg films, such as The Overcoat and The New Babylon. Later, he was commissioned to produce screen versions of the literary classics of socialist realism. His epic screenings of Alexander Fadeyev's The Young Guard (1948) and Mikhail Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don (1957–58) were extolled by the authorities as exemplary.

During several decades of their teaching in the VGIK Gerasimov and his wife Tamara Makarova prepared many generations of Russian actors. In his last film Gerasimov played Leo Tolstoy, while Makarova was cast as Tolstoy's wife. Gerasimov is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery of Moscow.

A rare glimpse of Sergei Gerasimov can be found in a one and a half minute behind the scenes documentary featured as part of the 'Coming From The Movies Set' series of Soviet film promos. In this piece Gerasimov can be seen in Norilsk on the set of his film ""Town Planners"". It's a story of two young architects struggling to build a new town in the Polar Regions. The film stars Ivan Negonov as the director of an Iron & Steel Works, Anatoly Solonitsyn as architect Kolmykov, Lyubov Virolainen as architect Arkhipova; and can be found as an extra on the 2003 DVD release of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1974 film The Mirror.

Moscow Film Festival
Gerasimov was the President of the Jury at the 1959, 1965, 1969 and the 1985 Moscow International Film Festival. He was a member of the jury in 1961 and 1971.

In 1967 his film The Journalist won the Grand Prix at the 1967 festival.

Burials at Novodevichy CemeteryNo. 298 Squadron was a Royal Air Force special operations squadron during the Second World War. Later in that war it changed to the transport role, disbanding after the end of the hostilities.

History

Formation
No. 298 Squadron was formed on 24 August 1942 at RAF Thruxton from a nucleus of 297 Squadron as a special operations squadron, equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. The squadron was however not required for operations, so the formation was suspended and the squadron was disbanded on 19 October 1942.

Gliders and Special Operations

The squadron was re-formed on 4 November 1943 at RAF Tarrant Rushton, from 'A' Flight of 295 Squadron, with the Handley Page Halifax. It trained to air-tow the big General Aircraft Hamilcar glider, but began operations in February 1944 in its original role, dropping SOE agents. On 16 March 1944 298 Squadrons 'C' Flight split off, to form 644 squadron.

During the Normandy landing the squadron air-towed both the Airspeed Horsas and the Hamilcars to landing-zones around the beach head. An unusual operation involved parachuting jeeps which had been carried underneath the Halifax. The squadron then returned again to SOE duties. In between the SOE duties the squadron air-towed Hamilcar and Horsa gliders for the Arnhem landing (Operation Market Garden). The squadron moved in March 1945 to RAF Woodbridge, England to air-tow gliders for the Rhine crossing (Operation Varsity). After Operation Varsity the squadron flew normal supply and transport duties.

Transport in British India
In July 1945 the squadron moved to Raipur, British India to provide transport support to the Army. In March 1946 the squadron was involved in rice-dropping sorties from Meiktila, Burma to the starving population in the jungle areas. The squadron disbanded at Mauripur, Sindh, British India (Now Pakistan Air Force Base Masroor) on 21 December or 30 December 1946.

93,107,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type5,"The Tulsa Performing Arts Center, or Tulsa PAC, is a performing arts venue in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. It houses four main theatres, a studio space, an art gallery and a sizeable reception hall. Its largest theater is the 2,365-seat Chapman Music Hall.  The Center regularly hosts events by 14 local performance groups. Tulsa Ballet, Tulsa Opera, Tulsa Symphony, and Celebrity Attractions (Broadway series) are among the Tulsa PAC's major clients. Tulsa Town Hall, Chamber Music Tulsa, Theatre Tulsa, American Theatre Company, Theatre Pops, Playhouse Tulsa, Theatre North, and the PAC Trust  also fill the PAC calendar.

Numerous headliners such as Michael Bublé, Kelly Clarkson, Steve Martin and Anthony Bourdain have appeared at the Tulsa Performing Arts Center. The complex was built with a combination of public and private funds and opened in 1977.  The building is home to a permanent collection of 76 works of art.

The Tulsa Performing Arts Center launched a regional ticketing company, run by the Tulsa PAC, in 2006.  MyTicketOffice.com handles the ticketing for 12 performance arts venues in Oklahoma and Texas.

History
The Tulsa PAC opened March 19, 1977, and was built with a combination of public and private funds. Minoru Yamasaki (who designed the former World Trade Center Towers) was the architect for the project. The Center is owned and operated by the City of Tulsa and guided by the TPAC Trust, of which the Mayor of Tulsa is a member. Its first Managing Director was Robert D'Angelo. The PAC's current director, Mark Frie, became director in June 2017.

The forerunner of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center was the Tulsa Municipal Theatre, now known as the Brady Theatre. When, in the early 1970s, it was determined that a new, updated theatre was needed, the Theatre Advisory Committee, headed by Charles E. Norman, was formed. Many different scenarios were studied, including the restoration of the Tulsa Municipal Theatre (built in 1914), and the Akdar Shrine theatre (vintage 1925). The committee became aware that John H. Williams, president of The Williams Companies, had purchased a nine-block area of land that he intended to develop. Williams’ original plan was to build a new headquarters for his company, which would consist of two 30-story buildings flanking Boston Avenue at 3rd Street. The scheme was reconfigured to make Williams’ headquarters one tall tower instead of two smaller buildings, and locate it in the middle of Boston Avenue at Second Street.  The land between 2nd and 3rd Streets on Cincinnati, occupied by a vacant Hotel Tulsa, was then made available and was given to the City by Williams for a performing arts venue. In May 1973, Williams and community philanthropist Leta Chapman made an offer to the citizens of Tulsa: If Tulsa citizens would vote to fund half of a performing arts center, Williams and Chapman would raise the other half. A bond campaign was launched, giving the proposed PAC the slogan “Everyone’s Place.”  The bond election, held in August 1973, was passed by 69%. The new Tulsa PAC was funded at $14 million.

Construction
Prior to construction, a private corporation, PACI, was formed to take over the ownership of the construction project and then return the PAC property back to the City of Tulsa after building completion.  This allowed for construction to move ahead at greater speed ahead of the rampant inflation.  A committee was formed to procure art for the building. One percent of all construction costs of public buildings in Tulsa must be spent on art for the building being constructed to comply with an ordinance adopted by the City of Tulsa in 1969. A combination of local, national and international art, including a large representation of Native American art, was purchased. The works of artists such as Alexandre Hogue, Wolf Kahn, Barbara Hepworth, Louise Nevelson and Woody Crumbo were among the original collection. The initial plan for the Tulsa PAC was for one large performance hall seating almost 2,400 and a smaller proscenium theater seating approximately 430. During the initial construction phase, two more studio theaters were added to the plans. The acoustics for the facility were the work of Bolt, Berenek and Newman, the firm responsible for the acoustics at Lincoln Center in New York City. Ultimately, the cost of building the Tulsa PAC was approximately $19 million. Additional revenue sources were found to fund the difference.

The facility underwent a major retrofit in the early 1990s to help the PAC become more accessible to people with disabilities. In 2000, the PAC completed a major expansion that included an additional studio theater, a large reception hall and a large suite of restrooms. This was the second addition of restrooms since the building opened in 1977.

Performance Venues

The Tulsa PAC has four main performance venues: Chapman Music Hall, John H. Williams Theatre, Liddy Doenges Theatre and Charles E. Norman Theatre. The PAC also houses two smaller event venues, the Kathleen P. Westby Pavilion and the Robert J. LaFortune Studio.

Chapman Music Hall
Accommodating 2,365 in Continental-style seating, Chapman Music Hall is the largest venue at the PAC. World-renowned talents, like Tony Bennett, Luciano Pavarotti, Norah Jones, Michael Bublé, Kelly Clarkson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Steve Martin and Itzhak Perlman, as well as touring Broadway musicals, such as The Book of Mormon, The Lion King, Wicked, Jersey Boys and The Phantom of the Opera have all played in this theatre. Ella Fitzgerald and the Tulsa Philharmonic were the opening entertainment in Chapman Music Hall on March 19, 1977.

John H. Williams Theatre
A scaled-down replica of Chapman Music Hall, the intimate John H. Williams Theatre seats 437 people. It opened in March 1977 at the same time as Chapman Music Hall and the former Studio I and Studio II. Chamber music, piano soloists, a variety of theatre productions, poetry readings and Celtic music concerts have been staged in the theater. Notable performers include U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins, classical pianist Awadagin Pratt, jazz singer Marilyn Maye, guitarist Tommy Emmanuel and singer Janice Ian.

Liddy Doenges Theatre
The former Studio I was renamed in 1994 following the death of arts patron Liddy Doenges who served on the TPAC Trust. This “black box” theater can accommodate up to 300 people in non-fixed seating.  Theatre productions, special events and cabarets are frequently staged in the Doenges Theatre.

Charles E. Norman Theatre
Charles E. Norman was one of the key city leaders who played a crucial role during the pre-construction and construction phase of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center. He served on the TPAC Trust until his death in 2010. The former Studio II was renamed for him in 2000. This theater seats approximately 200. Theatre productions, receptions, cabaret-style performances, master classes and rehearsals are the theater's main business.

Other Amenities

Robert J. LaFortune Studio
This space is used as a cabaret theatre during the PAC's Trust's annual SummerStage festival, and also is a setting for press conferences, pre-curtain lectures, master classes and cast parties. It can comfortably seat 100 at tables, and more with a combined table/riser seating arrangement. There is lecture seating for 200. Robert J.

59,108,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type6,"Saint Mary's School is a private independent Episcopal college-preparatory, boarding and day school for girls in grades 9–12. Located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Saint Mary's School operates as an independent school with a historic association with the Episcopal Church including an Episcopal chapel, St. Mary's Chapel, on the school's grounds. The school formerly operated as Saint Mary's College and for many decades educated young women in grades 11–12 and their freshman and sophomore years in college. The school changed to a four year high school in 1998, at which point the name reverted to Saint Mary's School, the original name of the institution when it was founded in 1842.

School information 
The school has 40 faculty members, with 80% holding advanced degrees.  Enrollment for the 2019-2020 school year is 297 full-time students, representing 11 states and seven countries. The average class size is 13 students. Saint Mary's has a 8:1 student to faculty ratio. Additionally, 36 faculty and staff members reside on the campus.

Among the superlatives assigned to the school include the oldest continuously operated school in Raleigh, North Carolina, the third oldest girls' school in the state, and the fifth oldest girls' boarding/day school in the United States. Saint Mary's celebrated its 175th anniversary, May 12, 2017.

History 
Founded in 1842 by the Rev. Aldert Smedes, an Episcopal priest, Saint Mary's School has operated continuously on the same site ever since.

With the support of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina, Smedes founded Saint Mary's as a school for young ladies ""designed to furnish a thorough and excellent education equal to the best that can be obtained in the city of New York, or in any Northern school."" The school was founded on the site of the Episcopal School of North Carolina, a short-lived school for boys in the 1830s. Three of the present school buildings—East Rock, West Rock and Smedes Hall—formed the original campus. East Rock and West Rock, the first two buildings, were constructed with remnant stones from the construction of the North Carolina state capitol.

During the Civil War, Saint Mary's became a safe haven for relatives of both Union and Confederate generals. Smedes kept the school operating throughout the war. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman's Union troops camped in The Grove on front campus, and Sherman visited Smedes in the main building. From 1906-1908 President Woodrow Wilson's daughter Eleanor Wilson attended Saint Mary's.

Today, Saint Mary's School is an innovative independent, Episcopal, college-preparatory, boarding and day school for girls in grades 9–12.

The historic core of the school's 23-acre campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a stop on the North Carolina Civil War Trails. The Saint Mary's Chapel, designed by Richard Upjohn, is a National Historic Site, and five of the school's 25 buildings are Raleigh Historic Properties.

Campus
Saint Mary's buildings date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and also include antebellum structures individually recognized as Local Historic Landmarks. Three buildings from the 1830s are visible from Hillsborough Street from behind a wooded glade of large oaks, hollies, and magnolias.
 
The school's oldest structures, East and West Rock, are matching buildings constructed with discarded stone from the building of the second North Carolina State Capitol in the 1830s. The brick Greek Revival building between them was erected soon after; it was remodeled in 1909 to include a Neoclassical Revival front portico and dormitory wings. This main building was named Smedes Hall for the school's founder, the Rev. Aldert Smedes.
 
Two buildings erected in the later nineteenth century are Gothic in style: the 1855 Richard Upjohn Gothic Chapel and the 1887 Gothic Revival arts building, a brick structure with pointed-arch windows.
 
The early twentieth century saw much construction; nearly all the permanent brick buildings, which were rendered in the Colonial Revival style, survive. Later construction continued to complement earlier buildings, and the view of the campus from Hillsborough Street remains notable for its historic integrity.

Saint Mary's School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 as a national historic district. The district encompasses nine contributing buildings, including St. Mary's Chapel.  Currently, the campus is considered to be part of downtown Raleigh.

Athletics 
Saint Mary's School offers a full interscholastic athletic program consisting of 18 sports teams. Saint Mary's School competes as a member of the Triangle Independent Schools Athletic Conference (TISAC) and the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association (NCISAA, 3A Classification). The following sports offered at Saint Mary's are:

The team joined the NHL in 1967 as an expansion team with five other teams; the Cleveland Barons, another 1967 NHL expansion team, were merged with the North Stars in the 1978–79 season. The North Stars played in the Stanley Cup Finals twice: as the Prince of Wales Conference champions in the 1980–81 season, and in the 1990–91 season after winning the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, but lost in both Finals. The North Stars played their home games at the Met Center. The team relocated to Dallas, Texas in 1993, after former owner Norman Green announced that he was moving the team to Dallas's Reunion Arena in search of a better economic situation, and are now known as the Dallas Stars. The North Stars played in the Norris Division of the Clarence Campbell Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL) in their last season. There were 16 head coaches for the North Stars team.

The North Stars' first head coach and general manager was Wren Blair, who coached for the first three seasons, and was the North Stars' general manager until 1974; Jack Gordon, Lou Nanne, and Bob Gainey were also the general manager of the North Stars during their tenures as head coach. Nine of the first twelve North Stars head coaches lasted less than two complete seasons, while ten of the first twelve head coaches have spent their entire NHL head coaching careers with the North Stars. Gordon was the first North Stars head coach to have coached more than two complete seasons, with four.

Several head coaches have had multiple tenures with the North Stars. Glen Sonmor served three terms as North Stars head coach. He is the North Stars' all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached, regular-season game wins, regular-season points, playoff games coached, and playoff-game wins. Sonmor's first term lasted five seasons, the longest duration for one North Stars head coach term; his last term lasted two games, which was the shortest tenure. Blair, Gordon and Charlie Burns each served two terms as the North Stars' head coach. None of their second terms were winning seasons.

Burns, Ted Harris, Parker MacDonald, Nanne, and Murray Oliver had once played for the North Stars; Burns is the only person to have been a player-coach for the North Stars, having done so in the 1969–70 season. 1980 U.S. Olympic ""Miracle on Ice"" coach Herb Brooks, who coached the North Stars in the 1987–88 season, is the only North Stars head coach to have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder; Harry Howell and Gainey were inducted as players. Sonmor and Gainey are the only head coaches to reach the Stanley Cup Finals with the North Stars, in the 1981 and 1991 Finals respectively. Gainey was the last head coach of the North Stars; he coached the franchise until the 1995–96 season.

82,109,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type3,"The Ōpārara River is a river in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island.  It is best known for the limestone arches it carved in the Oparara Basin.

The river and most of its tributaries originate in the Fenian Ranges in the Kahurangi National Park, where the river flows through a section of the Honeycomb Hill Cave.  Further downstream it continues through the Ōpārara Arch and the Moria Gate Arch, both of which are popular walking destinations.  These sections of the Ōpārara River, while still in dense native forest, can be reached by a forestry road.  For the majority of its length it continues to meander south through the Ōpārara Basin before turning west to flow into the Tasman Sea near the small settlement of Ōpārara north of the township of Karamea.

The river's color varies from tea-like shades of golden brown to red from the natural organic tannins released into the water by several of the plant species in the area. Leaves and other plant matter on the forest floor releases these tannins as they decompose - this eventually leeches into and stains the water, with the shade and intensity varying depending on rainfall and season.

The river and contributing streams in the area are a habitat for the endangered South Island whio; the area used to sustain a large population of whio and is now a location for a recovery programme run by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.
The rare and protected Ōpārara giant land snail (Powelliphanta annectens) has only been found in areas around 700 m from the Ōpārara River.

Brown trout can be fished year-round in the river's estuary.

Rivers of New ZealandIn American politics, a superdelegate is an unpledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote. These Democratic Party superdelegates (who make up slightly under 15% of all convention delegates) include party leaders and elected officials (PLEOs).

Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. This contrasts with pledged delegates who are selected based on the party primaries and caucuses in each U.S. state, in which voters choose among candidates for the party's presidential nomination. On August 25, 2018, the Democratic National Committee agreed to reduce the influence of superdelegates by generally preventing them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing their votes only in a contested nomination.

Superdelegates are not involved in the Republican Party nomination process. The state chairman and two district-level committee members from each state are automatically seated at the Republican National Convention, but they are obliged to vote for their state's popular vote winner under the rules of the party branch to which they belong.

Although the term superdelegate was originally coined and created to describe a type of Democratic delegate, the term has become widely used to describe these delegates in both parties. However, it is not an official term used by either party.

Description 
Of all the delegates to the Democratic National Convention, slightly under 15% are superdelegates. According to the Pew Research Center, superdelegates are ""the embodiment of the institutional Democratic Party – everyone from former presidents, congressional leaders and big-money fundraisers to mayors, labor leaders and longtime local party functionaries."" For Democrats, superdelegates fall into four categories based on other positions they hold, and are formally described (in Rule 9.A) as ""unpledged party leader and elected official delegates"" (unpledged PLEO delegates) consisting of

 Elected members of the Democratic National Committee: ""the chairs and vice chairs of each state and territorial Democratic Party; 212 national committeemen and committeewomen elected to represent their states; top officials of the DNC itself and several of its auxiliary groups (such as the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the National Federation of Democratic Women and the Young Democrats of America); and 75 at-large members who are nominated by the party chairman and chosen by the full DNC."" Most of the at-large members ""are local party leaders, officeholders and donors or representatives of important Democratic constituencies, such as organized labor."" There were 437 DNC members (with 433 votes) who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
 Democratic governors (including territorial governors and the mayor of the District of Columbia). There were 21 Democratic governors who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
 Democratic members of Congress. There were 191 U.S. representatives (including non-voting delegates from Washington, D.C. and territories) and 47 U.S. senators (including Washington, D.C. shadow senators) who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
 Distinguished party leaders (consisting of current and former presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs). There were 20 of these who were superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Of the superdelegates at the 2016 Convention, 58% were male and 62% were non-Hispanic white (20% were black and 11% were Hispanic). The average age was about 60. There is no bar on lobbyists serving as DNC members (and thus superdelegates); ABC News found that about 9% of superdelegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention (67 people in all) were former or current lobbyists registered on the federal and state level.

For Republicans, there are three delegates in each state, consisting of the state chairman and two Republican National Committee committee members, who are automatic delegates to the national convention. However, at the 2012 Republican National Convention, convention rules were amended to obligate these RNC members to vote according to the result of primary elections held in their states if the state holds a primary.

Comparison with pledged delegates 
Unpledged PLEO (party leaders and elected officials) delegates should not be confused with pledged PLEO delegates; Democratic Party rules distinguish pledged and unpledged delegates. Pledged delegates are selected based on their announced preferences in the contest for the presidential nomination. In the party primary elections and caucuses in each U.S. state, voters express their preference among the contenders for the party's nomination for President of the United States. Pledged delegates supporting each candidate are chosen in approximate ratio to their candidate's share of the vote. They fall into three categories: district-level pledged delegates (usually by congressional districts), at-large pledged delegates, and pledged PLEO delegates. In a minority of the states, delegates are legally required to support the candidate to whom they are pledged. In addition to the states' requirements, the party rules state (Rule 12.J): ""Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.""

By contrast, the unpledged PLEO delegates (Rule 9.A) are seated without regard to their presidential preferences, solely by virtue of being current or former elected officeholders and party officials. Many of them have chosen to announce endorsements, but they are not bound in any way. They may support any candidate they wish, including one who has dropped out of the presidential race.

Under Rule 9.C, the pledged PLEO slots are allocated to candidates based on the results of the primaries and caucuses. Another difference between pledged PLEOs and unpledged PLEOs is that there is a fixed number of pledged PLEO slots for each state, while the number of unpledged PLEOs can change during the campaign. Pledged PLEO delegates are not generally considered superdelegates.

Origins 
After the 1968 Democratic National Convention, at which pro-Vietnam War liberal Hubert Humphrey was nominated for the presidency despite not running in a single primary election, the Democratic Party made changes in its delegate selection process to correct what was seen as ""illusory"" control of the nomination process by primary voters. A commission headed by South Dakota senator George McGovern and Minnesota representative Donald M. Fraser met in 1969 and 1970 to make the composition of the Democratic Party's nominating convention less subject to control by party leaders and more responsive to the votes cast in primary elections.

The rules implemented by the McGovern-Fraser Commission shifted the balance of power to primary elections and caucuses, mandating that all delegates be chosen via mechanisms open to all party members. As a result of this change the number of primaries more than doubled over the next three presidential election cycles, from 17 in 1968 to 35 in 1980. Despite the radically increased level of primary participation, with 32 million voters taking part in the selection process by 1980, the Democrats proved largely unsuccessful at the ballot box, with the 1972 presidential campaign of McGovern and the 1980 re-election campaign of Jimmy Carter resulting in landslide defeats. Democratic Party affiliation skidded from 41 percent of the electorate at the time of the McGovern-Fraser Commission report to just 31 percent in the aftermath of the 1980 electoral debacle.

Further soul-searching took place among party leaders, who argued that the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of primary elections over insider decision-making, with one May 1981 California white paper declaring that the Democratic Party had ""lost its leadership, collective vision and ties with the past,"" resulting in the nomination of unelectable candidates. A new 70-member commission headed by Governor of North Carolina Jim Hunt was appointed to further refine the Democratic Party's nomination process, attempting to balance the wishes of rank-and-file Democrats with the collective wisdom of party leaders and to thereby avoid the nomination of insurgent candidates exemplified by the liberal McGovern or the anti-Washington conservative Carter and lessening the potential influence of single-issue politics in the selection process.

Following a series of meetings held from August 1981 to February 1982, the Hunt Commission issued a report which recommended the setting aside of unelected and unpledged delegate slots for Democratic members of Congress and for state party chairs and vice chairs (so-called ""superdelegates""). With the original Hunt plan, superdelegates were to represent 30% of all delegates to the national convention, but when it was finally implemented by the Democratic National Committee for the 1984 election, the number of superdelegates was set  Over time this percentage has gradually increased, until by 2008 the percentage stood at approximately 20% of total delegates to the Democratic Party nominating convention.

DNC Unity Reform Commission and superdelegate reform, 2016–2018
On July 23, 2016, ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the 2016 DNC Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly (158–6) to adopt a superdelegate reform package. The new rules were the result of a compromise between the Hillary Clinton and the Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns; in the past, Sanders had pressed for the complete elimination of superdelegates.

Under the reform package, in future Democratic Conventions, about two-thirds of superdelegates would be bound to the results of state primaries and caucuses. The remaining one-third—members of Congress, governors, and distinguished party leaders—would remain unpledged and free to support the candidate of their choice.

Under the reform package, a 21-member unity commission, chaired by Clinton supporter Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and vice-chaired by Sanders supporter Larry Cohen, was appointed after the 2016 general election. The commission's recommendations would be voted on at the next Democratic National Committee meeting, well before the beginning of the 2020 Democratic primaries. The commission was to consider ""a mix of Clinton and Sanders ideas"": expanding the ability of eligible voters to participate in caucuses (an idea supported by Clinton) and expanding the ability of unaffiliated or new voters to join the Democratic Party and vote in Democratic primaries via same-day registration and re-registration (an idea supported by Sanders). The commission drew comparisons to the McGovern–Fraser Commission, which established party primary reforms before the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

By April 2017, the complete committee had been appointed. In accordance with the compromise agreement, the 21 members include, in addition to O'Malley Dillon and Cohen; nine members selected by Clinton, seven selected by Sanders, and three selected by the DNC chair (Tom Perez). By May 2017, the DNC Unity Reform Commission had begun to meet to begin drafting reforms, including superdelegate reform as well as primary calendar and caucus reform.

In a series of meetings in the summer and fall of 2017, the Unity Commission ""considered various proposals for dealing with superdelegates — including automatically binding their votes to their states' choice"" but the issue of whether to abolish superdelegates altogether remained controversial within the party. In December 2017, the Unity Commission's recommendations  were delivered to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee. By December 7, both Perez and Deputy DNC Chair Keith Ellison co-authored an ""op-ed"" document for CNN, stating they intended to make ""a ""significant reduction"" of the number of superdelegates who vote to decide the party's nominee for president"". Ultimately, the DNC decided to prevent superdelegates from voting on the first ballot, instead of reducing their numbers.

Superdelegates in practice

1984 election

In 1984, only state party chairs and vice chairs were guaranteed superdelegate status. The remaining spots were divided two ways. Democratic members of Congress were allowed to select up to 60% of their members to fill some of these spots. The remaining positions were left to the state parties to fill with priority given to governors and big-city mayors, led by Democrats and based on population.

In the 1984 election, the major contenders for the presidential nomination were Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, and Walter Mondale. Entering the final handful of primaries on June 5, Mondale was leading Hart in the delegate count, with Jackson far behind. The battle for delegates became more dramatic that night when Hart won three primaries, including the big prize of California in a cliffhanger. The Mondale campaign said, and some news reports agreed, that Mondale secured the needed 1,967 delegates to clinch the nomination that night in spite of losing California. But the Associated Press concluded he was ""barely short of the magic majority."" Mondale wanted to make it indisputable that he had enough delegate votes, and his campaign set a deadline of one minute before noon; he made 50 calls in three hours to nail down an additional 40 superdelegates and declared at a press conference that he had 2,008 delegate votes. At the convention in July, Mondale won on the first ballot.

1988 election

In 1988, this process was simplified. Democrats in Congress were now allowed to select up to 80% of their members. All Democratic National Committee members and all Democratic governors were given superdelegate status. This year also saw the addition of the distinguished party leader category (although former DNC chairs were not added to this category until 1996, and former House and Senate minority leaders were not added until 2000). In 1992 was the addition of a category of unpledged ""add-ons"", a fixed number of spots allocated to the states, intended for other party leaders and elected officials not already covered by the previous categories. Finally, beginning in 1996, all Democratic members of Congress were given superdelegate status.

The superdelegates have not always prevailed, however. In the Democratic primary phase of the 2004 election, Howard Dean acquired an early lead in delegate counts by obtaining the support of a number of superdelegates before even the first primaries were held. Nevertheless, John Kerry defeated Dean in a succession of primaries and caucuses and won the nomination.

In 1988, a study found that superdelegates and delegates selected through the primary and caucus process are not substantively different in terms of viewpoints on issues from each other. However, superdelegates are more likely to prefer candidates with Washington experience than outsider candidates.

2008 election

At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, the superdelegates made up approximately one-fifth of the total number of delegates. The closeness of the race between the leading contenders, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, led to speculation that the superdelegates would play a decisive role in selecting the nominee, a prospect that caused unease among some Democratic Party leaders. Obama, however, won a majority of the pledged delegates and of the superdelegates, and thus clinched the Democratic presidential nomination by June.

At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, superdelegates cast approximately 823.5 votes, with fractions arising because superdelegates from Michigan, Florida, and Democrats Abroad are entitled to half a vote each. Of the superdelegates' votes, 745 were from unpledged PLEO delegates and 78.5 were from unpledged add-on delegates.

There was no fixed number of unpledged PLEO delegates. The number was allowed to change during the campaign as particular individuals gained or lost qualification under a particular category. The unpledged PLEO delegates were: all Democratic members of the United States Congress, Democratic governors, members of the Democratic National Committee, ""[a]ll former Democratic presidents, all former Democratic vice presidents, all former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate, all former Democratic speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives and Democratic minority leaders, as applicable, and all former chairs of the Democratic National Committee.""

There was an exception, however, for otherwise qualified individuals who endorse another party's candidate for President; under Rule 9.A, they lose their superdelegate status. In 2008, Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut endorsed Republican John McCain, which, according to the chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, resulted in his disqualification as a superdelegate. Lieberman's status had, however, previously been questioned because, although he was a registered Democratic voter and caucused with the Democrats, he won re-election as the candidate of the Connecticut for Lieberman Party and was listed as an ""Independent Democrat"". The count for Connecticut's delegates in the state party's delegate selection plan, issued before his endorsement of McCain, reportedly excluded Lieberman, and he was not included on at least one list of PLEO delegates prepared before his endorsement. In the end, he was not a superdelegate and did not attend the Democratic Convention; he was instead a speaker at the Republican Convention.

The unpledged add-on delegate slots for the various states totaled 81, but the initial rule had been that the five unpledged add-on delegates from Michigan and Florida would not be seated, leaving 76 unpledged add-on delegates. Michigan and Florida were being penalized for violating Democratic Party rules by holding their primaries too early.

The exact number of superdelegates changed several times because of events. For example, the number decreased as a result of the death of Representative Tom Lantos, the move from Maine to Florida of former Maine governor Kenneth M. Curtis, and the resignation of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. (Because New York's new governor, David Paterson, was an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee, he was already a superdelegate before becoming governor.) On the other hand, the number increased when special elections for the House of Representatives were won by Democrats Bill Foster, André Carson, Jackie Speier, and Travis Childers.

The biggest change came on May 31 as a result of the meeting of the national party's Rules and Bylaws Committee, which lessened the penalty initially imposed on Michigan and Florida. The party had excluded all delegates (including superdelegates) from either state. The Rules and Bylaws Committee voted to seat all these superdelegates (as well as the pledged delegates from those states) but with half a vote each. That action added 55 superdelegates with 27.5 votes. The total number of superdelegates could continue to change until the beginning of the convention (Call to the Convention Section IV(C)(2)). On August 24, the Democratic Party, at the request of Obama, awarded delegates from Michigan and Florida full voting rights.

Pledged delegates from state caucuses and primaries eventually numbered 3,573, casting 3,566 votes, resulting in a total number of delegate votes of 4,419. A candidate needed a majority of that total, or 2,209, to win the nomination. Superdelegates accounted for approximately one fifth (19.6%) of all votes at the convention and delegates chosen in the Democratic caucuses and primaries accounted for approximately four-fifths (80.4%) of the Democratic convention delegates. At the convention, Obama won 3,188.5 delegate votes and Hillary Clinton won 1,010.5 with 1 abstention and 218 delegates not voting.

Politico found that about half of the superdelegates were white men, compared to 28% of the Democratic primary electorate.

In the Republican Party, as in the Democratic Party, members of the party's national committee automatically become delegates. There are three Republican National Committee delegates (the national committeeman, national committeewoman, and state party chair) for each state. In the 2008 Republican National Convention, 123 RNC delegates among the 2,380 total delegates were not pledged to any candidate.

2016 election

On February 12, 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, was asked by CNN's Jake Tapper, ""What do you tell voters who are new to the process who say this makes them feel like it's all rigged?"" Schultz's response was, ""Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don't have to be in a position where they are running against grass-roots activists . . . And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn't competition between them."" This statement was hailed by Clinton supporters as a wise policy to maintain steady, experienced governance, and derided by Bernie Sanders' supporters as the establishment thwarting the will of the people.

Several mainstream media outlets included superdelegates in the candidate delegate totals during the primary elections although superdelegates do not actually vote until the Democratic convention and may change their minds on whom they are planning to vote for anytime before the convention. The Democratic National Committee eventually publicly instructed media outlets to not include them in primary delegate totals. Nevertheless, many outlets, including the Associated Press, NBC, CBS, and Politico, continued to report the candidate delegate totals by lumping the superdelegates into the totals, inflating Hillary Clinton's lead by over 400 delegates. Critics alleged that this created a perception of insurmountability and that it was done in order to discourage would-be Sanders supporters.

2020 election

This was the first election with the 2016–2018 superdelegate reform measures. Under these rules, superdelegates cannot vote on the first presidential nominating ballot, unless a candidate via the outcome of primaries and caucuses already has gained enough votes (more than 50% of all delegate votes) among only the elected pledged delegates. Superdelegates may vote in subsequent ballots when it becomes a contested convention in which the pledged delegate vote alone is insufficient to determine the nominee. This does not preclude superdelegates from publicly endorsing a candidate of their choosing before the convention.

Criticism 
Susan Estrich argued that these delegates would have more power than other delegates because of their greater freedom to vote as they wish beginning with the first ballot.

Delegates chosen in primaries and caucuses do not precisely reflect the votes cast, but Democratic Party rules require proportional allocation of delegates rather than the plurality winner of a state primary or caucus taking all of the delegates ('winner-take-all').

Criticism against the Democratic Party's use of superdelegates also came in November 2017 from Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's former running mate in the 2016 U.S. national election and the junior U.S. senator from Virginia. On November 15, 2017, Kaine stated that he had sent a letter to Tom Perez, the current DNC Chairman, criticizing the use of the superdelegate system; in general agreement with the junior U.S. senator from Vermont and 2016 Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders, with Kaine stating that ""I have long believed there should be no superdelegates. These positions are given undue influence in the popular nominating contest and make the process less democratic.""

ArctiinaeThe Old Holy Trinity Church is a redundant Anglican church in the village of Wentworth, South Yorkshire, England.  It is partly in ruins, and stands close to a newer church also dedicated to the Holy Trinity.  The old church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

History

The tower dates from the 14th–15th century, while the rest of the church was rebuilt in 1684 for William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford.  A new church, designed by J. L. Pearson was built nearby in 1872–76.  The nave of the old church was dismantled in the later part of the 19th century.  In 1925 the chancel and a chapel were restored for William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam.  Further renovation was carried out in 1985.  Holy Trinity was declared redundant on 12 February 1975, and was vested in the trust on 2 July 1976.

Architecture

The tower is constructed in ashlar sandstone and the rest of the church in rubble sandstone.  The roofs of the chancel and chapel are in stone slate.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a partly ruined five-bay nave, and a chancel with a north chapel.  The truncated tower has two stages.  In the lower stage is a small west window, and in the upper stage are two-light bell openings.  Only the south wall of the nave remains.  This has a central protruding doorway flanked by Ionic pilasters, and round-arched windows without tracery or glass.  The chancel has a central south door with a cartouche above it, on each side of which are two-light round-headed windows.  Both the chapel and the chancel have three-light windows.  On the north wall are a two-light and a three-light window, while on the west wall are two three-light windows.  Inside the chancel is a chancel arch and a two-bay arcade.  There are a number of memorials, the most important of which are to the Earls of Strafford and other members of the Wentworth family.  Other fittings have been removed.  In the west end of the chancel are steps leading down to the Fitzwilliam vault.

Rural municipalities of Nepal established in 2017Old Oak Common (OOC) is a railway station under construction on the site of the Old Oak Common traction maintenance depot to the west of London in Old Oak Common, approximately  south of Willesden Junction station. When built, it is expected to be one of the largest rail hubs in London, at about  in length and  below surface level.

The new station has been included as a part of the High Speed 2 line from London to Birmingham, covered by the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Act 2017. This hybrid bill conferred powers to construct and maintain phase 1, including intermediate stations.  The surrounding area, including possible above-station development, is controlled by the Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation set up in April 2015.
The station will provide a major transport interchange with a number of other main line and commuter rail services, including the Elizabeth line and other services on the Great Western Main Line. The High Speed 2 line will be below ground level at the Old Oak Common site, with the parallel Great Western Main Line and Crossrail tracks on the surface to the south. In  May 2020, the station gained planning permission.

Site and design

The proposed site of the Old Oak Common interchange station is located to the north of Wormwood Scrubs and the south of Willesden Junction, alongside the existing Great Western Main Line. The site formerly contained the disused EWS train maintenance site to the north, which was converted into a construction equipment marshalling area for the Crossrail project. Also on the site are the Elizabeth line's Old Oak Common Traction Maintenance Depot and the Great Western Railway North Pole depot for Intercity Express Programme trains.

The new High Speed 2 station at Old Oak Common is planned to act as a catalyst for the regeneration of this neglected part of West London, acting as a gateway to the development of a brand new neighbourhood adjacent to the site, creating tens of thousands of new homes, and integrated into the local area through urban design that maximises green space and the station's connection with local bus, cycling and walking routes.

OOC super-hub station will have a total of 14 platforms. There will be six  high-speed platforms, built underground, which will connect with eight conventional rail platforms at ground level serving the Great Western Main Line towards the West Country and Wales, Heathrow Express, as well as integrating the new east-west Elizabeth line (Crossrail) services. It will also have 44 escalators and 52 lifts, and will have a naturally-lit concourse to create a pleasing passenger experience while reducing energy consumption - a  atrium roof, inspired by the site's industrial heritage, will link the two halves of the station, also housing solar panels. The escalators, linking the concourse to the platforms 13.5 m below, will be the longest on the HS2 network.  It is estimated that the station will serve 250,000 passengers per day and will ultimately connect with eight of the UK's largest cities.

Construction

The delivery of OOC is a joint venture between Balfour Beatty, Taylor Woodrow Construction and SYSTRA, which was awarded in September 2019.
Initial groundwork started on the site in 2019, following the completion of the consultation opened in February 2019.

The station received renewed Government backing in April 2020 following the Oakervee Review, which allowed work to begin on removing  of London Clay to create the space required for the -long rectangular station box at a depth of . The piling alone will require the removal of a further , making a total of more than  of excavated material.

To overcome the site's limited access along the single-carriageway Old Oak Common Lane, and reduce lorry movements across London, a -long conveyor belt will be assembled to transport the excavated material to Willesden Euro Terminal railhead, to be removed by rail freight and then recycled. At its peak, there will be 1,500 workers building the station. In June 2020, sheet piling commenced on site after the station gained planning approval and the main works contractor for the station started work.

Permanent works began on site in June 2021, starting with the construction of 1.8 km-long underground walls which will form the underground station box for the HS2 platforms.

Planned services

The following table illustrates the planned range of services, based on current DfT documentation on the station, additional proposed serves are described in the following sub-sections.

The Business Case, released in 2020, suggests that every HS2 service that calls at London Euston will also call at Old Oak Common.

Journey times from Old Oak Common to Euston will be five minutes, to Birmingham Curzon Street 31minutes, and to Manchester Airport 56minutes.

Interchange proposals
Due to the proximity of the Old Oak Common site to other lines, it has been suggested that further connections could be made with commuter rail services. The 2010 DfT command paper highlights opportunities for interchanges at Old Oak Common with London Underground, London Overground, and West London line services between  and Milton Keynes Central.

Transit systems
An early report prepared in 2011  for the Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham by Terry Farrell & Partners explored several interchange possibilities and proposed the construction of an overhead light rail, automated people mover or personal rapid transit system linking ""Old Oak Central""  with ,  and Willesden Junction stations. However, , no actual proposals exist to create an interchange with these lines.

London Overground stations
Transport for London (TfL) considered several options for creating an interchange with London Overground, including a combined North London/West London Line station on the southern side of the site, adjacent to Wormwood Scrubs,  and two separate stations located to the south (West London Line) and to the west (North London Line) of the site.

In October 2017, TfL began a public consultation on the construction of two new Overground stations.

The consultation concluded that two separate London Overground stations (""Option C"") on the Old Oak Common site would be the preferred option:  on the North London line would be built to the west of the main station, and  on the West London line would be located east of the station, near Scrubs Lane.

In September 2017, a proposal was made for a new West London Orbital from Hounslow to Hendon using the disused Dudding Hill Line. If the scheme were to go ahead, London Overground services would run via Old Oak Common station located at Victoria Road and other new stations at Brent Cross West and Harlesden. Four trains per hour would run from Hendon to Hounslow and another service from Hendon to Kew Bridge via Old Oak Common. , the scheme was being considered by TfL.

Chiltern Main Line Connection
Network Rail has proposed that the Chiltern Main Line should have a second terminal at Old Oak Common to increase capacity on the route as there is no room to expand the station at Marylebone. To do so, services would use the Acton–Northolt line (formerly the ""New North Main Line"") with some Chiltern trains possibly terminating at Old Oak Common rather than Marylebone.

A 2017 Network Rail report on the long term plans for the Chiltern Line, included an option of providing additional platforms at Old Oak Common station area as a relief for Marylebone, with upgrading of the Acton-Northolt Line.

High Speed 1
Although the 2010 DfT proposal for HS2 outlined a number of other possible transport links at Old Oak Common, including the addition of a direct link with the High Speed 1 route to Mainland European services via the Channel Tunnel, it was removed following the Higgins Review 

Southern
Services operated by Southern running between  and  pass through the Old Oak Common site. The line will pass the planned location of Hythe Road Overground station to join the West London Line at Mitre Bridge, approximately  to the east of the Old Oak Common station site. TfL have stated that it will not be possible to construct platforms to accommodate Southern trains and that an interchange will not be provided.

Other proposals

The construction company Parsons Brinckerhoff submitted a detailed plan to High Speed 2 which included West London Line, North London Line, West Coast Main Line and Dudding Hill Line platforms, although this pre-dated the announcement of the HS2 London terminus such that their proposed alignment would not be possible.

Network Rail's London and South East Route Utilisation Strategy published in 2011 examines the possibility of constructing a chord through the Old Oak Common area to connect Crossrail to the West Coast Main Line. The report notes that a proportion of trains on the Crossrail service are planned to terminate at Paddington, and that a new western branch of Crossrail would enable those services to continue on towards  and beyond. The proposed link would also relieve pressure on Euston station by diverting WCML suburban trains onto the Crossrail route instead of terminating at Euston.

A separate proposal promoted by the Campaign for Better Transport advocacy group, the North and West London Light Railway, suggests running a light rail line past the Old Oak Common site between  and Brent Cross. This scheme is not, however, supported by any government plans.

Political support
The Old Oak Common plans were unveiled two months before the 2010 United Kingdom general election by the Labour government. While the Conservative/Liberal Democrat administration supported the HS2 project, the Conservative Party has indicated a preference to an alternative proposal, put forward by Arup, for the HS2 line to go directly to a hub station at Heathrow Airport. Under this scheme, the west London interchange would be situated at Heathrow rather than at Old Oak Common. Conservative MP Theresa Villiers (the former Minister of State for Transport) referred to the Old Oak Common scheme as ""Wormwood Scrubs International"", and criticised it on account of its distance from the airport and the inconvenience to airport passengers having to change trains. The former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has been non-committal in supporting the Old Oak Common site, and takes the view that further evaluation is required.

When asked about a High Speed Rail / Crossrail interchange at Old Oak Common, Transport Secretary Philip Hammond stated ""Lug your heavy bags down a couple of escalators along 600m of corridor and then change trains at a wet suburban station somewhere in north west London. That is not an option."".

The Old Oak Common plans are supported by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

Lord Mawhinney, a former Conservative MP for Peterborough concluded that the London High Speed 2 terminus should be at Old Oak Common, not at . That was because of tunnelling costs and possible fast turnaround times at Old Oak Common.

In summer 2011, Hammersmith and Fulham launched a wider 'Park Royal City' plan for Old Oak Common, including light rail or personal rapid transit lines to the surrounding areas.

It is widespread with an anthropogenic distribution in central and Eastern tropical Africa from Ethiopia, through East Africa, the Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa. 

A. mossambicensis is used by herbalists and local people to treat such ailments and conditions as malaria, bacterial infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is also used to reduce menstrual cramps as well as a uterotonic able to induce uterine contraction and labour in confinements. This species is used together with the Neem tree to control the breeding cycles of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Drugs extracted from the two species inhibit early maturing and reproduction of the fish, countering problems raised by having populations of diverse ages in commercial breeding ponds.

Phytochemical and anti-microbial properties
Two powerful stimulators of uterine contraction, the diterpenes kaurenoic and grandiflorenic acids, were found in the leaves of Aspilia mossambicensis. This lends credence to the idea that wild chimpanzees consume leaves of Aspilia species because of their pharmacological properties and could shed light on female chimpanzees' consuming such leaves more frequently than do males. Substantial amounts of thiarubrines, antifungal and nematocidal dithianes, were found in roots of plants growing throughout chimpanzee habitats.

Almaty Challenger II - 1The Palace Theatre is a disused theatre in Union Street, Plymouth, Devon in south west England. It opened in 1898 as a music hall but was damaged by fire only three months after opening, and was re-opened in 1899 as the New Palace Theatre of Varieties. In 1961 it was converted to a bingo hall, but later reverted to being a theatre as the Palace Theatre until 1983, when it became The Academy disco and finally operated as the Dance Academy, before being closed after Class A drugs were found on the premises.

The theatre was built in the Flemish Renaissance style, with the interior in an Art Nouveau style, with nautical features. It is now deteriorating while an agreement is reached about its future and it is listed as an ""at risk"" building. It is a grade II* listed building.

Opening
The theatre was built in 1898 on the corner of Union Street and Phoenix Street, for the joint owners, United Counties Theatres Limited and Horace and Lechmere Livermore (the ""Livermore Brothers""), to replace the original Palace of Varieties which had operated at the nearby St. James's Hall since 1866. The site was originally occupied by Frederick Burner, tobacconist, Jonathan Crowl, butcher, Mark Durbin, provision dealer, and John Shepheard, bootmaker.

The theatre was designed by William Arber of Wimperis & Arber from Sackville Street, London, and cost £95,000 to erect. The development included the adjacent Grand Western Hotel which cost a further £87,000.

The theatre was opened for a private viewing on Friday 2 September 1898 by a large number of invited guests who were entertained by the Royal Naval Band, directed by Mr. E. Binding with the first public show at 7.30 p.m. on the following Monday 5 September. Tickets for the opening show were priced at 2s 6d for the stalls, 1s 6d for the grand circle and 1s for the gallery.

The first show ran for three hours and featured a variety of acts. After a rendition of the National Anthem by the Princess Ladies' Orchestra from the Promenade Pier, the show was opened by Leopoldine, described as ""a lady who is very clever on the parallel bars and flying rings and kindred implements"". She was followed in turn by comedian Harry Comlin, Arthur Vining and Nellie Coleman (vocalists) and singer Emmie Ames. Adele and May Lilian, the Levey Sisters, were ""very chic"", and ""one of the features of the evening"" while the Marvellous Craggs ""were encored again and again for their wonderful acrobatic work"". Walter and Edie Cassons performed ""their highly amusing musical vaudeville"" Honours are Easy. Other acts included Walter Stockwell, a ""character vocalist"", Emmie Ames, a vocalist, and Fred Darby, roller skater, who closed the show.

During the interval, a formal opening speech was made by Mr. L.C.J. Livermore for the owners who welcomed the audience and apologised for the delay in opening the theatre, ""the long looked for come at last"", and promised ""better class"" acts in future. William Arber, the architect thanked the audience for their warm applause and said that he was pleased to have given ""the three towns ... a hall that they would be proud of"". Livermore went on to say that if the audience ""patronised the new hall as they should there was nothing the directors would not do to give them satisfaction"". Mr. E.J. Dexter, the manager of the theatre, also thanked the audience for their warm reception assuring them that it would be ""my pleasure to do everything I can for you during the coming season"". He said that he had travelled widely throughout Europe and in his opinion the only two theatres that were more beautiful were the Opera Houses in Berlin and Paris.

Original interior

In its original form, the theatre could accommodate 2,500 spectators. The auditorium was laid out with stalls on the ground floor behind which were the ""ordinary pit seats"". Entrance to the pits was gained by a tunnel described as ""an electrically lighted subterranean passage, fitted with mirror panels"". Above the ground floor were the cantilevered grand circle with the gallery on the top floor, with no pillars to obstruct the view of the stage. On each side of the proscenium were four boxes, eight in all.

The interior was decorated with a naval theme reflecting the history of Plymouth. Over the upper stage boxes were ""poop-lanterns"" resembling the sterns of three-deck warships; below these were crossed anchors with the centres containing ships' figureheads. Above the auditorium was a domed ceiling, which was decorated with ""historical paintings"" as was the proscenium. The scenes illustrated included the knighting of Sir Francis Drake by Queen Elizabeth I,  and the Spanish Armada. Medallions bearing portraits of naval and military heroes decorated the front of the gallery and grand circle.

On each side of the proscenium there was a clock face on which the number of the turn was illuminated.

In the main entrance there was a marble staircase, adorned with marble pillars, leading to the grand circle. In the foyer, described as ""beyond question one of the handsomest out of London"", was a painting of ""the meeting of Blücher and Wellington"" after the Battle of Waterloo.

The fire of 1898
In the early morning of 23 December 1898, a passing police officer spotted that there was a fire in the building. Although the fire brigade were called immediately, the rear of the building was well alight. By the time that the fire had been brought under control, the stage area, dressing rooms and the entire rear section of the building had been destroyed. As the safety curtain had not been lowered, the fire had spread into the auditorium and as a result most of the decorative features were also destroyed including the domed ceiling and the panels illustrating naval scenes.

The previous evening, the entertainment had included a sketch based on the Battle of Trafalgar, which included a ""spectacular naval scene"" involving the firing of stage cannon. Although firemen had been in attendance during the performance, heat from a cannon had ignited a curtain which later flared into flame.

Rebuilding
The theatre was rebuilt after the fire and was re-opened on 22 May 1899, although the interior was now much plainer than it had been originally. The paintings on the ceiling which had been destroyed in the fire were replaced by ""an allegorical group"".

Present interior
According to the 1989 edition of Nikolaus Pevsner's Buildings of England: Devon, the building ""represents the theatre as a place for lavish entertainment as reflected in the rich and exciting decoration and architectural detail, with particular attention to nautical themes"".

The stage is 28 ft. deep by 60 ft. wide with a proscenium opening of 29 ft. 6 in. and the grid height is 58 ft.

The rectangular proscenium arch is flanked by large boxes in the form of a ship's transom, decorated with plaster-work representing clinker planks each surmounted by a canopy bearing a pair of ship's lanterns. The two-tiered auditorium has panelled walls under a domed ceiling. The curved balcony is partly supported on slender cast-iron columns and decorated with military motifs in plaster-work.

The foyer opens onto a Sicilian marble balustraded staircase leading to a large first-floor saloon. Both the foyer and saloon are decorated with friezes with illustrations of nereids, dolphins, cherubs etc. The saloon is decorated in the Cinquecento style with a coffered ceiling and enriched spandrels above the arcades and Ionic capitals at the top of marble pilasters and columns. The saloon is lit by three large round-arched windows.

The manager's accommodation is situated on the third floor and can be accessed by a separate entrance on Phoenix Street.

Exterior

The building is described by English Heritage as being in the ""Northern Renaissance style with Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style) details"".

The building comprises two main sections: the former Grand Western Hotel occupied three bays at the eastern end of the building, with the New Palace Theatre occupying the seven bays to the west. The whole building is constructed of brick and yellow terracotta with the ground floor decorated with glazed tiles. The roof is of plain tiles with four banded brick and terracotta chimney stacks.

The Grand Western Hotel section is four stories high with dormer windows; at the corner there is now a small turret with a bell-shaped roof. Originally this was much higher with an arcaded section above which was a domed shaped roof surmounted by a weather vane, as seen in the 1905 illustration.

The ground floor has three arched bays, with the central bay being larger than those either side. In the arches are a variety of entrance doors (not original) above which are semi-circular spoked fan windows. Above the ground floor there is a tiled entablature bearing the legend ""Grand Western Hotel"". The first and second floors have central oriel windows set back, on top of which is a balcony with a turned balustrade, with smaller windows either side, slightly forward. The windows are decorated with Art Nouveau panels. On the top, third floor there are three pairs of arched windows with square columns.

The right-hand, Old Palace Theatre section has seven bays in the 2:3:2 formation with a colonnade of Tuscan columns between which are various entrance doors, some of which are original. Originally, the building had a wrought-iron canopy with seven arched sections, one above each entrance door, but this has been replaced by an unattractive modern canopy projecting from half-way up the height of the columns.

Above the ground floor, the entablature retains the original fine quality lettering and decorative detail, bearing the inscription ""New Palace Theatre"". The first floor facade is dominated by two semi-circular tiled panels on which are depicted scenes of the Spanish Armada; that on the left depicts the ""Spanish Armada Leaving Ferrol"" while that on the right depicts the ""Defeat of the Spanish Armada"". Above each panel is a pair of circular oculi windows. The central section has three round-arched transom windows flanked by Ionic half columns.

Above the central section is a tall ""piano nobile"" section with three pairs of arched windows, with each pair flanked by columns similar to those below. Above these is a large Flemish gable with a carved and shaped pediment with finial and a pair of statues of Spanish soldiers standing on brackets either side of the central window. In the centre of the pediment is a shield bearing the coat of arms of Plymouth, with the Cross of St. Andrew and the four turrets which overlooked the Barbican. Originally, a large two-sided clock was situated outside the present day window. Below this was a sign at right-angles to the building bearing the legend ""New Palace Theatre"", as shown in the 1905 illustration.

On the top, second floor above the left panel is a pair of arched windows similar to the central ones. Above the right panel the wall is blank although a balustrade stretches to the midpoint from the central section. The corner is surmounted by a turret which has a balcony and bell shaped dome with a ball finial. According to Pevsner, the turret is ""rather reminiscent of Winstanley's ill-fated lighthouse"".

The decorative style is briefly continued around the western edge of the building fronting Phoenix Street. On the ground floor, the first two bays have semi-circular spoked fan windows. Above these is a semi-circular window, the same size as the two panels at the front. Originally this window was glazed but is now blanked off; the decoration is completed by a pair of oculi windows as on the front with a single arched window on the top floor.

Set in the pavement outside the theatre entrances are four plaques featuring copies of programmes and playbills from the 1950s.

History

Music Hall and Variety Theatre
Following the fire of December 1898, the theatre re-opened on 22 May 1899 under new manager, Mr. James Wynes. In 1906, a sliding roof was installed into the theatre.

In September 1911, the theatre changed hands for the first time when it was sold to a syndicate headed by G. Hamilton Baines who also owned the Theatre Royal, Cardiff. In 1913, the theatre was sold to Thomas Hoyle for £25,000 but after three years he sold it on to Myer Fredman, who in turn sold it to John Tellam in 1924. Tellam died shortly after purchasing the theatre and it was then re-purchased by Thomas Hoyle for £25,000. Hoyle was also the owner of the Cinedrome cinema in Ebrington Street, Plymouth and the Belgrave Electric Theatre in Belgrave Road, Plymouth. During this period, the theatre was managed by Jack Fitchett, a former professional footballer who had played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester United and Plymouth Argyle.

Following Hoyle's death in 1932, the theatre passed to his widow, Mary. Mrs. Hoyle remained in charge of the theatre until her death in January 1945. Mrs. Hoyle kept the theatre open throughout the war, including during the blitz of 1940–1941. On 21 April 1941, several incendiary devices hit the theatre but the fires were quickly extinguished and little damage was done.

Mary Hoyle died in January 1945, after which a sale was agreed to Saul Silver, a commission agent from Exeter for a price of £77,000. This sale fell through and the theatre was eventually sold to a consortium of six businessmen, headed by Gerard Heath. In 1949, the theatre was closed for refurbishment, including the installation of new seating. It was re-opened a year later, with the opening show being headed by the Billy Cotton Band Show featuring Alan Breeze in ""Wakey! Wakey!"". Following the refurbishment, the theatre could accommodate 1,440 with 339 in the orchestra stalls, 307 in the pit stalls, 214 in the dress circle, 148 in the rear circle and 400 in the gallery with another 32 in the four boxes.

A lack of touring shows forced the theatre to close again in 1954; during this period, the opportunity was taken to further renovate the theatre, including enlarging the stage and rebuilding the dressing rooms. The theatre was offered to Plymouth City Council in 1956, but the council declined to purchase it. There were further closures for five months in 1956 and then in February 1959. The theatre was again offered to the city, for a price of £15,000, but again the council turned the offer down.

In 1961, Palace Theatre (Bingo) Limited acquired the theatre and converted the Circle lounge bar into a club. The theatre re-opened in 1962 with Reg Sully as the resident manager; the opening show was a pantomime, ""Sinbad the Sailor"". The theatre also became the home of a local amateur operatics group, the Carmenians, whose productions included ""Oklahoma!"" and ""Kiss Me Kate"". During this period, the theatre gained a reputation for being haunted, with lights turning themselves on and off and chained doors being unlocked.

In March 1965, the building was sold to Arthur Fox, a club owner from Manchester, for £50,000. The theatre became a club showing striptease and wrestling, and bingo under the ""Star Bingo"" style. In the summer of 1975, the business of Star Bingo was sold to the EMI group, and the theatre was re-opened on 19 April 1977 with a performance of ""The Magic Flute"" by the English Music Theatre Company, followed by a three-week jubilee show by the Carmenians.

The theatre was again closed for refurbishment in July 1978 and re-opened under the management of John Redgrave on 23 December for the pantomime, ""Cinderella"". Shortly afterwards, the owners of the theatre, New Palace Theatre (Plymouth) Limited, were experiencing financial difficulties and on 27 May 1980, the theatre was closed and the contents put up for sale. The theatre had one further brief respite when it re-opened on 16 May 1981 with a revue performance from Danny La Rue before finally closing as a theatre in 1983 to become the ""Academy Disco"". By this time, the city council had opened the new Theatre Royal, which effectively ended any prospect of live theatre at the New Palace Theatre.

By 1994, the building was owned by Graham Blow, a businessman from Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire, who was unsuccessfully seeking Government assistance to refurbish the building. The building was then sold to an Iranian businessman and club owner, Manoucehr Bahmanzadeh, who renamed it as ""The Dance Academy"".

Performers

During the years in which the theatre operated as a music hall, many well-known acts appeared on its stage. On 9 December 1902, Lillie Langtry appeared at the theatre portraying Virginia, Duchess of Keensbury in a production of The Crossways, which she had written in collaboration with J. Hartley Manners.

In August 1907, Gertie Gitana was on the bill, performing songs such as Nellie Dean; the Western Morning News described her as ""A youthful artiste possessing a well developed voice and a most winsome style.  She captivated her audience by a fine rendering of Nellie Dene (sic), a very difficult song to sing and she finished with a coon song and a well-executed dance which were much appreciated"".

In March 1909, the show included a presentation of a film of the boxing match between Johnny Summers and Jimmy Britt which had taken place at Covent Garden, London on 22 February. In August of that year, Harry Houdini was the star act. In his show, he challenged carpenters from the nearby Devonport Naval Dockyard to make a box from which he would not be able to escape. Houdini was nailed inside the box but managed to escape within 12 minutes. Later that week, Houdini was ""securely chained"" before diving off the Halfpenny Bridge, which connected Devonport with Stonehouse; Houdini returned to the surface within a minute of entering the water.

In 1931, Charlie Chaplin visited Plymouth as the guest of Lady Astor, the M.P. for Plymouth Sutton. He appeared on the stage at The New Palace Theatre on 16 November 1931, before catching a late train to London. Chaplin was seen off at the station by the manager of the theatre, Jack Fitchett, with whom he had previously appeared in The Mumming Birds when they were members of Fred Karno's Theatrical Company.

Among the acts appearing in 1941 were comedians Nor Kiddie and Tommy Handley who headed the cast of the variety shows on 20 and 27 January respectively, Billy Cotton and his band, Arthur Lucan (""Old Mother Riley""), Henry Hall and his ""orchestra"" and comedian Douglas Byng.

The comedy double act Laurel and Hardy were billed to appear at the theatre during their final tour of Europe. Starting on 17 May 1954, they were scheduled to appear for one week. They were performing the routine which had been specially written for the tour, ""Birds of a Feather"". Among the support acts were the comedian Harry Worth, ""Wonder Horse Tony"", Peggy Cavell (""The Cartoon Girl"") and Alan Rowe (""Born to Impress""). After performing the first night, Oliver Hardy was taken ill with flu and suffered a mild heart attack and as a result the duo had to pull out of the rest of the engagement. A brass plate on the pavement outside the theatre commemorates their performance.

The Dance Academy
Manoucehr Bahmanzadeh acquired the building in 1997 and renamed it ""The Dance Academy"". It soon became one of the top dance venues in the UK attracting top D.J.s such as Ferry Corsten, Judge Jules, Lisa Lashes, Dave Pearce, Gilles Peterson, Carl Cox and Sasha. The club could accommodate 1,300 dancers in two rooms and had seven bars and ""gained a heady reputation"" as a top trance and hard house club under resident D.J., Tom Costelloe. By 2005, the club claimed that it had in excess of 20,000 members.

In 1998, Bahmanzadeh entered a short partnership with the team behind “Scream” and established ""Eyecon"", a weekly hard house and trance night from 10.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. on Saturdays. This grew to be one of the UK's biggest dance events and was voted Club of the Year (West region) in the clubbing magazine ""Mixmag"" in 2004. As well as Eyecon, the club hosted other musical genres, such as Legends of the Dark Black a drum and bass night, held on the last Friday of each month. and the infamous Jelly Jazz parties.  In 2004, the club had a brief but unsuccessful attempt to present live music, hosting groups such as Hope of the States.

Closure
In May 2006, a five-month-long police operation showed that ecstasy, a Class A drug, was being used and dealt in the Dance Academy, and it closed as a result, with Bahmanzadeh, Costelloe and two other people being charged with permitting the supply of Class A drugs. Following the closure, protests were held outside the building by clubbers opposed to the closure.

In July 2008, Bahmanzadeh and Costelloe were found guilty of allowing the sale of a class A drug and were sentenced to jail terms of nine years and five years respectively. 16 drug dealers had also been arrested following the raid in May 2006 and had been sentenced to a total of 27 years in jail. During the trial, the court heard that the sale and consumption of ecstasy was ""rampant"" and dealing was ""overt and blatant"". In December 2008, both men appealed against their convictions on the grounds that the court should not have accepted evidence from undercover police officers, but the appeals were rejected.

In September 2010, Costelloe was the subject of an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 under which assets deemed to have come from a crime could be seized and confiscated. The Crown Prosecution Service (C.P.S.) calculated that Costelloe had only benefited to the extent of his wages when employed at the club, i.e. £6,600. As Costelloe had no significant assets, the confiscation order was agreed at Nil. Costelloe was released from jail after the confiscation hearing and started to re-build his career as a D.J.

Bahmanzadeh was ordered to pay £1 million under the Proceeds of Crime Act. For the purposes of assessing Bahmanzadeh's net worth, the theatre building was valued at a nominal £1 by his defence, although the C.P.S. considered the value to be between £50,000 and £100,000. Bahmanzadeh was also ordered to pay £75,000 towards the cost of his trials. In January 2012, the Member of Parliament for Plymouth Moor View, Alison Seabeck, asked a question in the House of Commons, enquiring whether or not the confiscation order had been paid. On behalf of the Secretary of State for Justice, Crispin Blunt replied that the sum had been paid in full in June 2011 together with £19,977 of interest for late payment. Mrs. Seabeck was not satisfied with this response and she sought clarity over where the money was actually paid. She laid down a further question for the Secretary of State asking ""whether or not the monies levied were paid directly to the Crown Prosecution Service or into another account"". Mr. Blunt replied that most of the money (£950,730) had been paid from a Jersey bank account and retained by the Jersey authorities. Only £69,248 had been paid in the UK of which £12,984 had been paid to the C.P.S. and the balance retained by the Home Office. Mrs. Seabeck voiced her surprise at this decision, describing the amount paid to the C.P.S. as ""derisory"". A spokesman for the Jersey authorities said that the Attorney General's office was ""currently in communication with the Home Office regarding the matter"".

In January 2012, Bahmanzadeh applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (C.R.C.C.) for the right to lodge a further appeal against his conviction and sentence, on the grounds that new evidence had come to light which cast doubt on the reliability of a key prosecution witness at the original trial. The C.R.C.C. accepted that there were grounds for a fresh appeal and on 26 January they referred Bahmanzadeh's conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal. Bahmanzadeh was released from prison on bail on 13 July 2012; he had been serving his sentence at Ford Open prison while working on day-release at a Brighton charity shop.

The appeal was heard at the Court of Appeal in November 2012. The court heard allegations that one of the witnesses for the prosecution at the original trial was a doorman who, after he had been sacked by Bahmanzadeh, supplied ""intelligence"" to the police about activities in the club. The court heard that the doorman had been involved in other criminal activities and was therefore not a reliable witness. Although Lord Justice Laws accepted that the doorman was not a credible witness, his evidence was ""by no means at the heart of the case"". As a result the original conviction was upheld. Under new sentencing guidelines, Bahmanzadeh's original sentence of 9 years in jail should be reduced to 7½. As he had been imprisoned in July 2008, he had already served half his sentence and was therefore entitled to be immediately released from custody. Following the failure of the appeal against conviction, Bahmanzadeh continued to protest his innocence, calling the affair a ""joke"".

In February 2013, Plymouth City Council reviewed Bahmanzadeh's dance licence; at the hearing on 26 February, the licensing sub-committee decided to revoke his entertainment licence, thus preventing him from re-opening the Dance Academy.

Current situation and prospects for the future
In October 1974, the theatre and hotel were grade II* listed. The property was later placed on the English Heritage ""At Risk Register"".

In October 2006, Plymouth City Council published the Millbay and Stonehouse Area Action Plan which stated: The Palace Theatre will be regenerated and be a key landmark on Union Street, which will have regained its prominent position as one of the most vibrant arteries in the City.The Palace Theatre was formally(sic) a key element of the vibrant Union Street and remains a landmark building. It is a grade II* Listed Building and therefore is one of the most important historic buildings in Plymouth. It is currently being used as a nightclub, but is in need of major refurbishment appropriate to its conservation status. It has been highlighted on the national and local Buildings At Risk Register as a building requiring urgent attention. A number of ideas have been generated during recent years on ways to restore the building to give it a use that can be appreciated by a wider section of the community. However none of these ideas have led to a firm deliverable proposal.

Despite this, the local authority has repeatedly declined to commit any finances towards the restoration of the building, both in the 1950s, when they turned down opportunities to acquire the building and again in 2011, when they declined the offer from English Heritage to finance 80% of the cost of repairs if the council put up the balance in conjunction with a repair notice or urgent works notice to at least make the property weatherproof pending a decision about its future.

In 2008 it was included on a list by The Victorian Society of the UK's ten most endangered and best Victorian and Edwardian buildings. The Victorian Society described the building as ""crying out for attention"" and expressed fears for the future of the building in the absence of urgent action. At this time the building was said to be suffering badly with damp with a leaking roof and rotten floorboards. In July 2010, the building was put on the Theatres Trust's list of the ten most ""at risk"" buildings; a spokesman described the building as ""empty and in a poor state of repair"". Despite this, the trust was hopeful that the theatre could be restored with funding from the National Lottery. The trust described the theatre as ""a fantastic and opulent theatre... one of Plymouth's best surviving Victorian buildings... being of great significance and value with enormous potential to the people of Plymouth.""

Following his release from jail, in July 2012 Bahmanzadeh pledged to re-open the Dance Academy, stating that the deterioration to the building was ""cosmetic"" and that ""nothing bad was happening to the building"". In October 2012, Bahmanzadeh claimed that he and a member of Plymouth City Council's planning and regeneration department had toured the building to inspect its state of repair, whereas the council spokesman said that ""A council building surveyor met with the owner to discuss a minor structural matter"". Following this ""meeting"", Bahmanzadeh offered to have discussions with anyone wishing to restore the building ""with one condition – the help is unconditional. Don't put any conditions, like 'give me the lease' because nothing like that is going to happen"".

In September 2012, the ""Stonehouse Action"" group held a street party in Union Street to celebrate the theatre and to increase public awareness of its present state. Various other community groups have campaigned for the restoration of the New Palace Theatre to its former glory as a music hall while others seek the re-opening of the Dance Academy. In February 2013, ""Project Palace"" was founded in an attempt to bring together all the groups wishing to save the building; Stonehouse Action and the Friends of the New Palace Theatre are planning to form a building preservation trust to secure and renovate the building. The group claim that they have agreed with Bahmanzadeh to take a year's lease on the property with an option to purchase it from its present owner.

After his entertainment licence was revoked, Bahmanzadeh suggested that he might transfer the building to ""an Islamic charity to turn it into a mosque"". This led to the creation of an online petition by protestors who wanted the Dance Academy to be re-opened.

In the local redevelopment plan issued in October 2006, the City Council concluded: ""An innovative and creative approach will be required in order to bring the building back into use and improve its external appearance."" Although six years have elapsed, little progress has been made and the building continues to deteriorate. In July 2012, the local newspaper the Plymouth Herald, commented:Its neglected state does not present our city in a good light, and there is a huge groundswell of feeling that it must be brought back to life – whatever it ultimately becomes. It is a landmark with amazing history, and maybe its rebirth could help lead a revival of Union Street and bring fresh enjoyment to new generations. Whatever its past, we believe it still has a vital role to play in Plymouth's future.

In 2013, convicted fraudster David Welsh registered a company, Palace Theatre Project Limited which according to an interview in the local Plymouth Herald newspaper was seeking to refurbish the building.

Restoration
In 2015 a charity based in the South-East of England purchased the venue on a 35 year lease off the owner. The charity (GO! Great opportunities) released plans to turn the empty venue into Plymouth's first ballroom while also being returned to a theatre again. The renovations started in May 2015 and were due to finish three years later in 2018. The project was the largest volunteer based project in the South-West of England. The charity pulled out of the project in March 2017.

22,117,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type9,"Claude Jacques Berge (5 June 1926 – 30 June 2002) was a French mathematician, recognized as one of the modern founders of combinatorics and graph theory.

Biography and professional history
Claude Berge's parents were André Berge and Geneviève Fourcade. André Berge (1902-1995) was a physician and psychoanalyst who, in addition to his professional work, had published several novels. He was the son of the René Berge, a mining engineer, and Antoinette Faure. Félix François Faure (1841-1899) was Antoinette Faure's father; he was President of France from 1895 to 1899. André Berge married Geneviève in 1924 and Claude, the subject of this biography, was the second of their six children. His five siblings were Nicole (the eldest), Antoine, Philippe, Edith, and Patrick. Claude attended the École des Roches near Verneuil-Sur-Avre about 110 km west of Paris. This famous private school, founded by the sociologist Edmond Demolins in 1899, attracted students from all over France to its innovative educational program. At this stage in his life, Claude was unsure about the topic in which he should specialize. He said in later life:

“I wasn't quite sure that I wanted to do mathematics. There was often a greater urge to study literature.”

His love of literature and other non-mathematical subjects never left him and we shall discuss below how they played a large role in his life. However, he decided to study mathematics at the University of Paris. After the award of his first degree, he continued to undertake research for his doctorate, advised by André Lichnerowicz. He began publishing mathematics papers in 1950. In that year two of his papers appeared, the short paper Sur l'isovalence et la régularité des transformateurs and the major 30-page paper Sur un nouveau calcul symbolique et ses applications. The symbolic calculus which he discussed in this major paper is a combination of generating functions and Laplace transforms. He then applied this symbolic calculus to combinatorial analysis, Bernoulli numbers, difference equations, differential equations, and summability factors. In 1951 he published a further two short papers Sur l'inversion des transformateurs and Sur une théorie ensembliste des jeux alternatifs  that announced various results that would be discussed fully in his thesis. He was awarded a doctorate in 1953 for his thesis Sur une théorie ensembliste des jeux alternatifs, under the supervision of André Lichnerowicz. In this thesis, he examined games where perfect information is available in which, at each move, there are possibly an infinite number of choices. The games are not necessarily finite, with indefinite continuation being allowed. Berge examined the properties of such games with a thorough analysis. A 55-page paper based on his thesis, and with the same title, was published in 1953.

Berge married Jane Gentaz (born 7 January 1925) on 29 December 1952; they had one child, Delphine, born on 1 March 1964. In 1952, before the award of his doctorate, Berge was appointed as a research assistant at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. In 1957 he spent time in the United States as a visiting professor at Princeton University. He took part in the Economics Research Project there which was under contract with the Office of Naval Research. While in Princeton he undertook work which was presented in the paper Two theorems in graph theory published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. This was one of his first papers on graph theory, his earlier work being on the theory of games and combinatorics. He was writing his famous book Théorie des graphes et ses applications Ⓣ at this time and had just published his book on the theory of games Théorie générale des jeux à n personnes Ⓣ (1957). Returning to France from the United States, Berge took up the position on Director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique. Also in 1957 he was appointed as a professor in the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris. Théorie des graphes et ses applications Ⓣ was published in 1958 and, remarkably, in the following year his third book Espaces topologiques, fonctions multivoques Ⓣ was published. For a mathematician in their early thirties to publish three major books within as many years is a truly outstanding achievement.

In 1994 Berge wrote a 'mathematical' murder mystery for Oulipo. In this short story Who killed the Duke of Densmore (1995), the Duke of Densmore has been murdered by one of his six mistresses, and Holmes and Watson are summoned to solve the case. Watson is sent by Holmes to the Duke's castle but, on his return, the information he conveys to Holmes is very muddled. Holmes uses the information that Watson gives him to construct a graph. .

Beginning in 1952 he was a Research Assistant at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and from 1957 to 1964 he was a Professor at the Institute of Statistics at the University of Paris. From 1965 to 1967 he directed the International Computing Center in Rome. He was also associated with the Centre d'Analyse et de Mathématique Sociales (CAMS), a research center of École des hautes études en sciences sociales. He held visiting positions at Princeton University in 1957, Pennsylvania State University in 1968, and New York University in 1985, and was a frequent visitor to the Indian statistical institute, Calcutta.

The period around 1960 seems to have been particularly important and fruitful for Berge. Through the book Th´eorie des graphes et ses applications he had established a mathematical name for himself. In 1959 he attended the first graph theory conference ever in Dobogok˝o, Hungary, and met the Hungarian graph theorists. He published a survey paper on graph coloring. It introduced the ideas that soon led to perfect graphs. In March 1960 he talked about this at a meeting in Halle in East Germany. In November of the same year, he was one of the ten founding members of the OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litt´erature Potentiel). And in 1961, with his friend and colleague Marco Sch¨utzenberger, he initiated the S´eminaire sur les probl`emes combinatoires de l’Universit´e de Paris (which later became the Equipe combinatoire du CNRS). At the same time, Berge achieved success as a sculptor.

In 1994 Berge wrote a 'mathematical' murder mystery for Oulipo. In this short story Who killed the Duke of Densmore (1995), the Duke of Densmore has been murdered by one of his six mistresses, and Holmes and Watson are summoned to solve the case. Watson is sent by Holmes to the Duke's castle but, on his return, the information he conveys to Holmes is very muddled. Holmes uses the information that Watson gives him to construct a graph. He then applies a theorem of György Hajós to the graph which produces the name of the murderer. Other clever contributions of Berge to Oulipo are described in [6].

Another of Berge's interests was in art and sculpture. He described his early sculptures, made in part from stones found in the river Seine, in his book Sculptures multipètres (1962). Bjarne Toft writes [21]:-

“In our modern everyday life, we are surrounded and bombarded by (too) beautiful, flawless pictures, sculptures, and designs. In this stream, Claude Berge's sculptures catch our attention, with their authenticity and honesty. They are not pretending to be more than they are. Berge catches again something general and essential, as he did in his mathematics. The sculptures may at first seem just funny, and they certainly have a humorous side. But they have strong personalities in their unique style - you come to like them as you keep looking at them - whether one could live with them if they came alive is another matter!”

Mathematical contributions
Berge wrote five books, on game theory (1957), graph theory and its applications (1958), topological spaces (1959), principles of combinatorics (1968) and hypergraphs (1970), each being translated in several languages. These books helped bring the subjects of graph theory and combinatorics out of disrepute by highlighting the successful practical applications of the subjects. He is particularly remembered for two conjectures on perfect graphs that he made in the early 1960s but were not proved until significantly later:
A graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect, proven by László Lovász in 1972 and now known as the perfect graph theorem, and
A graph is perfect if and only if neither it nor its complement contains an induced cycle of odd length at least five, proven by Maria Chudnovsky, Neil Robertson, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas in work published in 2006 and now known as the strong perfect graph theorem.

Games were a passion of Claude Berge throughout his life, whether playing them –
as in favorites such as chess, backgammon and hex – or exploring more theoretical
aspects. This passion governed his interests in mathematics. He began writing on
game theory as early as 1951, spent a year at the Institute of Advanced Study
at Princeton in 1957, and the same year produced his first major book Th´eorie
g´en´erale des jeux `a n personnes [1]. Here, one not only comes across names such
as von Neumann and Nash, as one would expect, but also names like K¨onig, Ore
and Richardson. Indeed, the book contains much graph theory, namely the graph
theory useful for game theory. It also contains much topology, namely the topology of relevance to game theory. Thus, it was natural that Berge quickly followed
up on this work with two larger volumes, Th´eorie des graphes et ses applications
[2] and Espaces topologiques, fonctions multivoques [3]. Th´eorie des graphes et ses
applications [2] is a master piece, with its unique blend of general theory, theorems – easy and difficult, proofs, examples, applications, diagrams. It is a personal
manifesto of graph theory, rather than a complete description, as attempted in the
book by K¨onig [31]. It would be an interesting project to compare the first two earlier books on graph theory, by Sainte-Lagu¨e [34] and K¨onig [31] respectively, with
the book by Berge [2]. It is clear that Berge’s book is more leisurely and playful
than K¨onig’s, in particular. It is governed by the taste of Berge and might well be
subtitled ‘seduction into graph theory’ (to use the words of Rota from the preface
to the English translation of [13]). Among the main topics in [2] are factorization,
matchings and alternating paths. Here Berge relies on the fundamental paper of
Gallai [25]. Tibor Gallai is one of the greatest graph theorists – he is to some
degree overlooked – but not by Berge. Gallai was among the first to emphasize
min-max theorems and LP-duality in combinatorics. 

He is also known for his maximum theorem in optimization and for Berge's lemma,  which states that a matching M in a graph G is maximum if and only if there is in G no augmenting path with respect to M.

Art
In addition to mathematics, Claude Berge enjoyed literature, sculpture, and art.  Berge co-founded the French literary group Oulipo with novelists and other mathematicians in 1960 to create new forms of literature. In this association, he wrote a murder mystery based on a mathematical theorem: Who killed the Duke of Densmore?  In an adaptation of this story, the Duke of Densmore is killed by an explosion.  10 years later, Sherlock Holmes and Watson are called to investigate this unsolved case.  Using the testimonies of the Duke's seven ex-wives and his knowledge of interval graphs, Holmes is able to determine which one made multiple visits to the Duke and was able to plant the bomb.

Awards and honors
Berge won the EURO Gold Medal from the Association of European Operational Research Societies in 1989, and (with Ronald Graham) the inaugural
Euler Medal from the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications in 1993.

Reviews of his books

Review by: Frank Harary.

The American Mathematical Monthly 70 (1) (1963), 106-107. 
This is the English translation of ""Théorie des graphes et ses applications,"" Dunod, Paris, 1958. Congratulations are in order to Alison Doig of the London School of Economics and Political Science on a most competent translating job. Occasionally cultural differences between the French and the British are noticeable, as in the Introduction where ""II est tres remarquable . . . "" is translated: ""It is a matter of common observation .. "" (that different disciplines often use analogous theorems). The French book was reviewed by R A Good in The American Mathematical Monthly 68 (1961) 76-77. The first and last sentences of Good's review state: ""The tentacles of the theory of graphs steadily grow more numerous and penetrate more deeply into many phases of mathematics. All in all, in this book we have an up-to-date exposition, by one of the developers himself, of an intriguing theory capable of handling a fascinating potpourri of situations.""

In our review of the French book in Mathematical Reviews 21 (1960), 309, we noted: ""This is the second book on graph theory ever written. The previous book is the already classical: Denes König, 'Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen' (Akademische Verlag, Leipzig, 1936; Chelsea Publishing Company, New York, 1950). There are however several books on combinatorial analysis and topology which contain a chapter on graph theory. There has recently been a resurgence of interest in both the theory and application of graphs, whence the author obtains the title of his book. The book contains a considerable number of new results on graph theory which have been discovered since the book of Denes König, and is therefore a most welcome addition to the mathematical literature."" The most noticeable change is that Appendices III, IV and V have been omitted in translation. Appendix IV in the original book stated 14 unsolved problems. Of these, Problem 4 was solved recently by Chong-Yun Chao, Problem 11 was solved in our previous review, and Problems 12-14 ask the reader to settle the Four-Colour-Conjecture. The accuracy of the references has been improved. Unfortunately some of them still refer to several papers. The inclusion of an author index in this English translation would have been very welcome. At the present time, the existing or announced books on graph theory are as follows: 1. Denes König, original in German, being translated into English. 2. Claude Berge, original in French, English translation herewith reviewed. 3. 0ystein Ore, Theory of Graphs, American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications 38, 1962. 4. 0ystein Ore, Graphs and their uses, forthcoming in the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) series. In addition, several other graph theorists are actively engaged in writing their own versions of the fundamentals, foundations, and elements of graph theory. It is to be hoped that with all of these contributions to the field, as well as those books on graph theory written primarily for an audience of electrical engineers, operations researchers, or social scientists, two developments will become more pronounced: (i) each scholar who finds it convenient to use structural or combinatorial concepts in his own research will not feel obliged to rediscover graph theory for himself, ab initio. (ii) this elegant theory with its applications within mathematics to topology, logic, algebra, and combinatorial analysis will eventually become an undergraduate course at most modern universities.

Review by: Rufus Isaacs.

Operations Research 7 (5) (1959), 681-682. 
The term graph, the subject of this book, has not the common connotation of a plot or curve but refers to an established but esoteric mathematical usage. A graph is a set of points, certain pairs of which are connected by arcs. These arcs may or may not be oriented, that is, have an associated definite direction from one endpoint to the other. Possibly a new name to dispel confusion would be apropos. We offer theory of linkages. The geometric aspect of the above definition is of course not the heart of the matter; graphs can be symbolic diagrams of a rich variety of situations. The points can represent almost any kind of object and the arcs almost any type of interrelation between them. Thus we should expect the subject to abound in diverse applications, and Berge's book does. Thumbing through the volume, one is fascinated by the variegated array of illustrations, and the diverse examples attest to the very eclectic contents. The research analyst will find much to charm as well as instruct him. Hitherto the standard work was Denes König's 'Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen' (Leipzig, 1936). One read here of a branch of classical mathematics that struck out in many directions but penetrated deeply in few, the minor efforts of many major mathematicians. A purview of the subject can be had from a glance at a sampling of the more renowned problems. An Euler line [named after Leonhard Euler] is one that covers every arc of a graph and can be drawn without lifting the pencil or retracing. It stems from the famous problem of the seven bridges of Königsberg as recounted in most histories of mathematics and is popularly described as being the starting point of topology. A Hamilton line [named after William Rowan Hamilton] is nearly a dual concept: it need not cover all the arcs but must pass over each vertex once and only once. In both cases the problem is to ascertain conditions under which it is possible to draw the appropriate line. The Euler problem is rather easy, but the Hamilton problem is still unsolved. One of the most famous of all unsolved problems is that of map coloring: to show that four colors suffice to color any planar map so that adjacent countries are always of distinct hue. It becomes a question of graph theory if we let each vertex represent a country, connecting them by an arc when the corresponding countries have a mutual borderline. The cream of such older problems is elegantly treated in Berge's book. But along with them are the current advances in the subject. The disciple of operations research will recognize much material and many names; a good proportion is American. For example, there is a chapter on transportation networks. It includes the Ford-Fulkerson algorithms [named after Lester Randolph Ford (1886-1967), Delbert Ray Fulkerson (1924-1976)], and the theorems of Hoffman [Alan Jerome Hoffman (1924-)] and Gale [David Gale (1921-2008)]. As usual, the applications are astonishingly diverse. Besides questions of optimizing transport and routing, the same techniques are fitted to the problem of minimal covering, some combinatorial teasers, problems in set theory, and linear programming. The methods continue to solve problems in some subsequent chapters; in one on couplages we find a problem typical of the applied scope of this theory. In what are called simple graphs, the vertices are divided into two sets such that all arcs connect only members of one set with points of the other. A couplage is a subset of these arcs, with no two having a common endpoint. The problem: to find a maximum couplage. What is an application? Let one of the two sets of vertices above represent a set of workers, and the other, jobs to be done. A connecting arc is drawn when a worker is capable of fulfilling that job. Then a maximum couplage corresponds to a maximal scheme of assigning workers to suitable jobs. A second, but more trivial application, deserves to be quoted on less technical grounds:

“Dans un collège mixte américain, toute jeune fille a mm ""boy-friends,"" et tout garçon a mm ""girl-friends""; est-il possible de faire danser simultanément chaque jeune fille avec un de ses boy-friends et chaque garçon avec une de ses girl-friends?”

There is a chapter on game theory (the author has done a separate monograph on this subject); others deal with matrices and trees. There is an appendix on electrical circuit theory and some allied non-electrical problems. Always there is stimulating diversity. In the chapter entitled Facteurs, for instance, three consecutive examples run: Voyage around the World (William Rowan Hamilton); The Knight's Tour of the Chessboard (Leonhard Euler); and - a quick plunge to modern times and queuing problems - The Bookbinding Problem [Selmer Martin Johnson (1916-1996)]. The operations analyst will benefit from this work (aside from enjoying himself) in acquiring an arsenal of new and imaginative techniques. Even should he never have occasion to use them, his wits cannot be but sharpened owing to the remarkable way seemingly disparate concepts are linked by common underlying ideas.

19,118,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type9,"National Penn Bancshares, Inc.  (referred to as National Penn or NatPenn) was an American financial services corporation, with assets (as of April 14, 2015) of approximately $9.6 billion. National Penn operations include a regional banking franchise operating primarily in three states with more than 130 branches, as well as online and mobile services. It also operated a trust company (National Penn Investors Trust Company) and a wealth management division (National Penn Wealth Management).

By assets, National Penn is the seventy-second largest bank in the United States, and the fifth largest bank headquartered in Pennsylvania. National Penn is based in Allentown. National Penn trades on NASDAQ under the symbol NPBC. In August 2015, it was announced National Penn had been acquired by BB&T.

History
National Penn was founded in 1874 as The National Bank of Boyertown. The company went public in 1982, and changed its name to National Penn in 1993. The bank has completed twelve acquisitions since 1990, and terminated one. By 2015, National Penn had grown into 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, and the bank had $9.6 billion in assets.

In the spring of 2014, National Penn moved its headquarters to downtown Allentown, consolidating their facilities in one location. In August 2015, it was announced National Penn had been acquired by BB&T, which was expanding its presence in the mid-Atlantic states. National Penn CEO Scott Fainor said the deal was practical because BB&T could offer customers a wider range of products and services, such as deposit, loan and insurance offerings. Additionally, he said, new federal banking compliance rules would have cost National Penn millions of dollars annually. The merger is expected to close by mid-2016. BB&T seeks to achieve cost savings of about 30 percent of National Penn's non-interest expenses, totaling $65 million. As a result, job cuts are expected.

Charitable efforts
National Penn donated a new police headquarters for the Boyertown Police Department in 2015.

Summary
After five editions of the European Championship, from 1952 to 1956, the championship from 1957 took the name of the World Championship, at least for the 500cc class. The 250cc class, introduced this season, will also dispute five running-in seasons, from 1957 to 1961, a period in which it will take on the name of the European Cup, to become World Championship as well starting from the 1962 season.

From April to August the 500cc class held 9 grands prix which awarded points to the first six classified competitors, respectively: 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1. The score in the final classification of each competitor was calculated on the best four results.

Documentary films about baseballThe Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation (MVF)is an Indian non-government organisation (NGO) established in 1981 in memory of educationist and historian Prof. Mamidipudi Venkataraangaiya by prof shantha sinha The MVF began as a research institution on issues relating to social transformation. Today, the Foundation is building the capacities of community in rural and urban areas for abolition of child labour by universalizing social education. It uses an ""area-based"" approach instead of a target-based approach. The area-based approach concentrates on protecting the rights of every children and ensuring all of them attend full-time formal education. It draws plans for children to withdraw from work and prepare them to be integrated into schools. Schemes were also designed to ensure that children are retained in school and will continue to do so without any disruption.

Objectives
Universalizing formal education has been one of the foundation's key objectives. It seeks to address the rights of the entire universes of children- both in school and out of school - in the 5-14 age group and its area of operation. It sees children who are deprived of education opportunities as intrinsically hazardous to their growth and well-being. The MV Foundation also ensures that every child attending school does so without any disruption until she reaches class 10 since there is no guarantee that the child does not get pushed out of school to join the labour force again.

Impact
Over the years, over 1,000,000 children have been freed from child labour, enrolled and retained in school, more than 4000 bonded labourers have been released and 168 villages in Andhra Pradesh are now child labour free. The core strategy of MV Foundation to achieve its objective of transforming child labours to students is through the residential bridge camps. It has been implemented in more than 6000 villages and an estimated 45000 child labours have thus benefited from these bridge camps. Through the Stop Child Labor Campaigns and Child Rights Protection Forum (CPRF), they had successfully mobilised communities to establish a social norm against child labour and to understand that school is the fundamental right of a child.

The greatest impact is the direct cooperation of the MV Foundation with the government of Andhra Pradesh, facilitating the application of the MVF approach in the entire state. It has also leveraged on the support of every section of society on a village and national level to create the community pressures for ensuring sustainability in its institutions and strategies.

Enrolling children into schools
The MV Foundation uses a variety and combination of strategies to enroll children into schools and into classes appropriate to their age. One of the strategies is the MVF Bridge Camp. These are residential camps in which children spend between three and eighteen months depending on their need.

The camp enables children to catch up on missed education and serves as an adjustment period for both child and family. They are given opportunities to interact with peers of their own age and get accustomed to the new lifestyle at their own pace. Parents meanwhile adapt to the changes in their child and their role as parents of a student.

Challenges of enrolling children into schools
One key concern related to the residential bridge camps is the use of residential bridge camp. There are worries that there might be the risks of a place where children’s rights are being abused rather than respected. Furthermore, concerns regarding separation of children from their own families and their cultural identity are also being raised.

97,122,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type8,"Heritage High School is a public secondary school located in Leesburg, Virginia, and is part of Loudoun County Public Schools.  The principal is Jeff Adam. Its naming broke the previous tradition of naming high schools with two words prior to ""High School"" (Loudoun County High School, Broad Run High School, etc.).

Heritage is located in the southern border of Leesburg, adjacent to J. Lupton Simpson Middle School and Evergreen Mill Elementary School.  It does not serve the southern Leesburg community however, due to the very densely populated eastern section of Leesburg, which Heritage currently serves, including the Sycamore Hill, Potomac Station, Tavistock Farms, Kincaid Forest, Red Rock, Spring Lakes neighborhood and River Creek communities.

History
Heritage opened in 2002 for the eastern Leesburg community, feeding most of its students from Stone Bridge High School and the rest from Loudoun County High School.  It was originally expected that Simpson's 8th graders would feed into Heritage, but instead, boundary lines were drawn to have Harper Park Middle School feed into Heritage.  The lines were drawn and are still drawn to the point where students who live in communities adjacent to Heritage do not go there for high school and instead go to Loudoun County High.

Like other new high schools that opened in Loudoun County before it, such as Stone Bridge and Potomac Falls, Heritage opened without a senior class, and juniors were allowed to choose which school they wanted to graduate from.  Most Heritage students came from the Stone Bridge attendance area, and many rising juniors (Class of 2004) at Stone Bridge chose to stay there rather than go to Heritage.  This was somewhat understandable because Leesburg students at Stone Bridge in the class of 2004 attended J.L. Simpson Middle School for 6th and 7th grade (1997–1999); went to a brand new Harper Park Middle School for 8th grade (1999–2000); went to a brand new Stone Bridge for their first two years of high school (2000–2002); and then were expected to go to another new school for their last two years.  Constant boundary adjustments may have contributed to the large number of rising juniors who wished to remain at Stone Bridge. Consequently, the junior class at Heritage was only about 110 members, rather than about 250 if all juniors were required to go to the new school. In 2010, Heritage switch some of its students to Tuscarora High School in order to alleviate overcrowding.

Of the 312 students in the graduating class of 2006, 112 received the governor's seal on an Advanced Studies diploma, one of the highest academic honors offered by the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Like other Loudoun County high schools, Heritage participates in the Advanced Placement program and offers numerous AP courses.

Mimi Groves & Jimmy Galligan
In June of 2020, following the George Floyd protests and Mimi Groves posting support for the Black Lives Matter movement, a short video made by her in 2016 began circulating online. The video drew criticism as she, a white freshman student, used a racial slur while stating excitedly, ""I can drive, [slur]"" after getting her learner's permit. The slur was not directed at anyone specifically. The video was posted online by another classmate, Jimmy Galligan, who ""wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word."" This came shortly after Groves was accepted to the cheerleading team of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Following this controversy and a public outcry, the university removed Groves from the cheerleading team and she came under pressure to withdraw from the school altogether.

In late 2020, this became a national news story and Heritage and Loudoun County Public Schools came under fire for being a ""hostile learning environment"" for students in minorities. Galligan also came under scrutiny for perpetuating cancel culture, with many seeing this as unfair treatment towards Groves.

Accreditation and test scores

Accreditation
Heritage High School is a fully accredited high school based on the Standards of Learning tests in Virginia.

SAT scores
The average SAT score in 2006 for Heritage was a 1,532 (518 in math; 515 in critical reading; 499 in writing).

Enrollment history

Athletics
The mascot is the Pride, in the shape of a Lion.  Heritage's sports teams currently play in the Dulles District and Region II of the Virginia High School League.  The Pride opened as a member of this district.

Basketball

The school is well known for its boys' basketball team which consistently has made it to Region II playoffs, Its 2006 team was the first undefeated team in the history of the Dulles District. The Pride boys' basketball team has won 3 consecutive Dulles District Championships: 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Soccer

The boys' soccer team did well in the 2006 season, shaking off the new school reputation, with the Pride's soccer team making it to the AA State Semifinals before falling 2–1 to AA Dulles District champion Potomac Falls.  A tenacious rivalry would develop between the two teams, who met five times that season with the Panthers going 4–0–1, including wins over the Pride in the Dulles District Tournament Finals, the Region II Finals, and the State Semifinals.

They finished Second place in the 2007 Regular Season after topping Potomac Falls for a period, who had suffered a tie to Loudoun County and a tie 2–2 to the Pride.  However, Potomac Falls would end any chance of Pride Silverware by beating them 0–3 in a heated game away near the end of the season.  In the Dulles District Tournament, the Pride finished in Second after a heart breaking overtime loss to Loudoun County finishing 2–1; ending the campaign early.

Two years later in 2010, Coach Betsey Munson and a new squad would go on to make another run, finishing in Second place for the Regular Season and making it to the Post-Season Tournament Final, but this time in the AAA Cedar Run District.  In the Tournament Final, they narrowly missed out losing to Battlefield 1–2; Jake Flanagan scored the Pride’s lone goal unassisted. Having finished Second in both competitions the Pride would advance and make an away Regional Appearance.

In 2013, Coach Munson claimed the state record for having the most wins as a female coach in Virginia High School League history for boys soccer.

The Pride defeated Park View 3–0 and became Regular District Champions for the second time from a hat-trick by Gio Vasquez against Park View in 2015

Lacrosse

The Heritage boys' lacrosse team did well in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, finishing 15–3 and 14–3 respectively.  They were tournament champions in 2007 and regular season champions in 2008.  The class of 2008 has had the strongest class in school history and graduated with the most wins in school history.  The class of 2008 also had 3 members go on to play collegiately at the NCAA level.

Other Sports

Heritage teams did surprisingly well in the 2005–2006 year.  Both the girls' and boys' track teams won their respective AA Dulles District Titles.  The football team also had its first winning season in the 2005–2006 school year, with a 7–3 record, sharing the Dulles District title with Park View High School, but unable to make the playoffs because Park View had more power points in the Virginia High School League’s rating system. in 2015, third year head coach Reed Prosser helped the Pride to a 6–4 record, after starting 6–0, and to a playoff appearance.

The Heritage girls' varsity swim and dive team have made a vast improvement over the season of 2014–2015. Seeing as the girls have placed first in the Conference 21 meet, taking first at regionals was an even bigger step. To finish up the season, the team placed third in the 4A Northern Virginia Annual States meet.  There were also many record-breakers for swimmers on the Heritage varsity swim and dive team in the 2014–2015 season.

Arts

Marching Band 
The Pride of Heritage Marching Band competes in the 2A division of USBands. They placed 2nd in the state and 8th at nationals in 2017. The band is currently under the direction of George Herrmann. In 2018 the band placed second in the state again, while winning the overall music caption award. In 2019, the band placed 6th in the state along with also receiving the overall music award.

He was appointed by prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on 1 September 2014 after serving as Thailand's chief of defense forces.

Chief of Defense Forces 

Patimaprakorn served as Thailand's chief of defense forces from 2011 to 2014. In this position, he oversaw combat readiness and commanded military operations in all three branches of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. His position was at the top of the military chain of command, although in practice he remained subordinate to army chief Prayut Chan-o-cha.

Role in the Cabinet

Deputy-Head of the National Council of Peace and Order
On May 22, 2014, it was announced that Patimaprakorn would serve as the Deputy-Head of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He is one of 11 military officers appointed to the 32-member cabinet. This announcement took place during the Thai military coup of 2014. It was initially thought that the military had no interest in a coup, as Patimaprakorn had made a public statement in early May 2014 suggesting as much.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has stated that the goals of the NCPO are greater political stability and reforms for Thailand, and Patimaprakorn supported that statement in his message to the United Nations in September 2014. He stated that Thailand was ""not retreating from democracy; it just needed time and space to bring about reconciliation, undertake political reforms and strengthen democratic institutions."" In a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, Pratimaprakorn has also acknowledged the importance of addressing climate change and extremism in Thailand.

Pratimaprakorn has also addressed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In his remarks in June 2015, he mentioned the need for combating extremism once again, in addition to expressing a need for greater disaster management in Asia and emphasizing Thailand's efforts to address human trafficking. He ended his remarks by stating that Thailand would be happy to work as a bridge between OSCE and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Pratimaprakorn has also been vocal in the need to support migrants off the coast of Thailand. In a special meeting attended by 16 powerful countries in the region, Pratimaprakorn urged unity on the issue and said that all countries must work together to solve what is a very complex problem. He also described the actions Thailand is currently taking on the issue, which includes deploying vessels at sea as floating platforms to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants.

Minister of Foreign Affairs

As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Pratimaprakorn is responsible for communicating and meeting with foreign governments.

One of the major actions he has undertaken in this position is working closely with Prime Minister Chan-o-cha to ensure closer ties with China. He has said of the two countries' diplomatic relations, ""At this moment we believe this is the best time for our relationship. Especially for my personal contact with minister Wang Yi who is a very nice and polite person.” Yi had similar comments about Pratimaprakorn and about China's relations with Thailand, saying that they are ""as close as family members."" China and Thailand have recently been working to join hands on projects like infrastructure and clean energy, and Pratimaprakorn has even said that ""the China-ASEAN bloc works as more of a community of shared destiny.""

In January 2015, Pratimapragorn welcomed U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel to Thailand on a visit meant to show that the U.S wanted to be more assertive in its relationship with Thailand. The visit turned controversial, however, after the U.S urged Thailand to end martial law and return to civilian rule.

In December 2015, Patimaprakorn also welcomed the Ambassador of the Russian Federation, Kirill Barsky, speaking with him about increasing tourism to Russia from Thailand and preparing to jointly celebrate the 120th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and Thailand.

It is also known as Comet Masonic Temple. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.

History 
The Masonic temple at Barcaldine was constructed in 1901 as the second temple of the Comet Lodge, the first having been moved from Dingo Creek in stages following the growth of the railway line.

Freemasonry spread from New South Wales into Queensland in individual lodges. The first Freemason's lodge in Queensland was established in 1859, shortly before Separation from New South Wales. New lodges were formed as settlement spread and freemasonry was carried along newly built roads and railways by Masons who were working on them. In 1876 Robert Ballard, Chief Engineer with the Central Western Railway pushing westwards from Rockhampton and a handful of other Masons, established the Comet Lodge No 1680 at Dingo Creek. The lodge is possibly unique in that it holds its warrant almost  away from the town for which it was granted. The railway workers who were members carried their building with them, dismantling it and moving it in railway trucks to be bolted together again in a new settlement as work progressed. In this manner it moved to the new railway camp at Cometville in 1878, Emerald in 1879, Bogantungan in 1881, Pine Hill in 1883, Jericho in 1885 and finally came to rest in Barcaldine in 1886. It was then refurbished.

A new and larger temple was constructed in 1900 for a cost of  and is said to have been based on the original. It was dedicated in 1901 and continued to make an important contribution to the life of the town as a venue for social interaction. Conservation work was undertaken on the building in the early 1980s, when the painted ""masonry"" effect on the facade was reinstated.

Description 
The masonic temple is located on the west side of Beech Street, Barcaldine. It is a two-storey, timber-framed building set on low stumps with a gambrel corrugated iron clad roof with triangular dormers on the north and south sides. The exterior is clad plainly in vertical corrugated iron on the back and sides.

The most striking feature of the building is the elaborate treatment of the front, which is clad with horizontal timber boards painted to mimic ashlar masonry. The gable facing the front has scalloped barge boards and finials. The facade is divided into three bays by fluted timber pilasters supporting a scalloped entablature below the eave. It has a central entrance sheltered by a pediment porch and flanked by sash windows. The upper storey has high round arched windows to each bay. The sides of the building have large windows on the ground floor and small high openings on the floor above.

The interior is clad with tongue and groove timber boards and is very intact, retaining the original colour schemes. The ground floor, which is used as a supper room, exhibits a brown dado with hand painted floral frieze. Above this are horizontal tongue and groove boards painted ochre yellow. The room has a series of shallow arched enclosed beams supporting the upper floor. At the rear of the ground floor there are ancillary rooms situated in either corner. Between them is a central entrance which has a section of hit and miss flooring, presumably for the clearing of mud from boots.

From here a timber stair with a simple slatted balustrade rises in an L form to the upper floor landing off which a dressing room opens directly into the lodge room. This has partially curved ceilings that rise to a boarded ceiling set between moulded ribs which spring from mock pilasters at the side walls. The ceiling between has been lined with what appears to be ""caneite"" sheet. The wall panels are a mix of horizontal and diagonal boards set above a simple dado. It is lit only by small high windows down the sides and by the three semicircular windows at the front.

It is partly in ruins, and stands close to a newer church also dedicated to the Holy Trinity.  The old church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

History

The tower dates from the 14th–15th century, while the rest of the church was rebuilt in 1684 for William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford.  A new church, designed by J. L. Pearson was built nearby in 1872–76.  The nave of the old church was dismantled in the later part of the 19th century.  In 1925 the chancel and a chapel were restored for William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam.  Further renovation was carried out in 1985.  Holy Trinity was declared redundant on 12 February 1975, and was vested in the trust on 2 July 1976.

Architecture

The tower is constructed in ashlar sandstone and the rest of the church in rubble sandstone.  The roofs of the chancel and chapel are in stone slate.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a partly ruined five-bay nave, and a chancel with a north chapel.  The truncated tower has two stages.  In the lower stage is a small west window, and in the upper stage are two-light bell openings.  Only the south wall of the nave remains.  This has a central protruding doorway flanked by Ionic pilasters, and round-arched windows without tracery or glass.  The chancel has a central south door with a cartouche above it, on each side of which are two-light round-headed windows.  Both the chapel and the chancel have three-light windows.  On the north wall are a two-light and a three-light window, while on the west wall are two three-light windows.  Inside the chancel is a chancel arch and a two-bay arcade.  There are a number of memorials, the most important of which are to the Earls of Strafford and other members of the Wentworth family.  Other fittings have been removed.  In the west end of the chancel are steps leading down to the Fitzwilliam vault.

22,130,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type4,"The Aru (or Haru) was a major Sumatran kingdom from the 13th to the 16th century. It was located on the eastern coast of North Sumatra, Indonesia. In its heyday the kingdom was a formidable maritime power, and was able to control the northern part of the Malacca strait.

The kingdom was initially established as a Karo polity. The indigenous population practiced native animism as well as Hinduism. During the 13th century Islam came to be practiced alongside the existing faiths. Aru's capital was located close to present-day Medan city and Deli Serdang. The people of the kingdom are believed to have been descendants of the Karo people from the interior of North Sumatra.

Location
Traditionally, the location of Haru or Aru is connected to the site of its successor state, the Sultanate of Deli, which was in and around the city of Medan and Deli Serdang today, as suggested by British orientalist Winstedt. However, Groenveldt, a Dutch historian, has suggested that the center of the Haru Kingdom was located further southeast, near the estuary of the Barumun and Panai Rivers, in Labuhan Batu Regency, and is thus related and connected to the earlier Pannai Kingdom. Gilles suggested that the capital was located near Belawan Harbour, while another opinion suggested the estuary of the Wampu River by Haru Bay, Langkat Regency.

The Kota Cina site in Medan Marelan, and Benteng Putri Hijau in Deli Tua, Namorambe, Deli Serdang Regency, are archaeological sites near Medan, which are connected to the Aru Kingdom. The Benteng Putri Hijau archaeological site is under threat of residential development. Another archaeological site is Kota Rentang in Hamparan Perak area, Deli Serdang Regency, which archaeological experts have suggested was the capital of Aru Kingdom.

Historiography
The earliest historical record mentioning the Haru kingdom was a Chinese chronicle dated from the Yuan Dynasty (late 13th century). There is another Chinese record from a later period, the Yingya Shenglan (1416) of the Ming Dynasty. The Kingdom of Haru was also mentioned in two Javanese records, the Nagarakretagama (1365) and Pararaton (c. 15th century). The Malay Annals mentioned Haru as one of a few influential kingdoms in the region, whose prestige rivaled that of Pasai and the Malacca Sultanate. The Portuguese record Suma Oriental written in the early 16th century mentioned Aru as a prosperous kingdom.

History

Formation

The people of Aru are believed to be the descendants of, or related to, the Karo tribe which inhabits the Tanah Karo further inland. This suggestion is based on a plausible etymology of similar sounding names, between ""Aru"" or ""Haru"" with ""Karo"".

The Benteng Putri Hijau archaeological site, at an ancient fortress near Medan, shows several layers of cultures estimated to date from between the 12th and 18th centuries. The fort is in the Karo and wider Batak tribes' tradition of constructing huta or kuta, a walled compound completed with parik (moat) as a defensive structure to protect the village against incessant tribal warfare. Artifacts found include stone tools, Chinese ceramics, tin bullets and Aceh coins. A fragment of lingam was discovered at the nearby site of Sukanalu, suggesting that the population of Aru adhered to both native animism and Hinduism prior to Islam entering the region.

The Haru Kingdom was mentioned in a Chinese chronicle of the Yuan Dynasty. According to this source, in 1282 Kublai Khan demanded that Haru to submit to China's suzerainty and Haru responded graciously by sending tribute to Yuan's court in 1295. Marco Polo however, did not mention Aru in his report as one of the 8 kingdoms of Sumatra during his journey in 1292.

The Haru Kingdom is mentioned in two Javanese sources originating from circa the 14th century. According to Pararaton, Haru kingdom was mentioned among polities that Gajah Mada intended to unite under Majapahit suzerainty in his Palapa oath. In 1339 a Javanese Majapahit naval expedition attacked several coastal states in Sumatra; although it failed to capture Samudera Pasai, the Javanese expedition did manage to gain control of Haru and Pane (Pannai). The Nagarakretagama (1365) canto 13 mentioned Aru as one of Majapahit vassal states in Sumatra.

According to Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai and the Malay Annals the Aru kingdom was Islamized by Nakhoda Ismail and Fakir Muhammad; they also converted Merah Silu, the first king of Samudera Pasai in the mid-13th century. According to Yingya Shenglan (1416), a Chinese Ming dynasty report composed by Ma Huan about the Zheng He expedition, the king of Haru and his subjects had embraced Islam. After the 13th century, Islam slowly began to gain followers among the population of Aru. However, native animism or paganism is still pervasive, especially amongst the population of the interior region, and a few Hindus still survive.

Growth

The discovery of Muslim headstones at burial sites in Kota Rentang suggests that the ruling elites of Aru Kingdom, the King and his family, has converted to Islam. These Islamic headstones are made from volcanic tuff with Arabic Jawi script similar to those found in Aceh and other Malay states. The site is in Kota Rentang in Hamparan Perak, Deli Serdang, believed to be the location of the capital of the Aru kingdom. Numerous artifacts have been discovered at this site, including Islamic headstones, ceramics and pottery fragments from China, Thailand and Sri Lanka, and Arabic coins from the 13th and 14th century. Other discoveries include traces of timberworks, building stones and the remnants of a wooden ship.

In the 15th century, the Malay Annals mentioned the Haru kingdom as one of a few influential kingdoms in the region, with its prestige rivaling those of Pasai and the Malacca Sultanate. During that period, the kingdom was a formidable maritime power controlling the northern part of the Malacca Strait.

Both the Malaccan Malay and Portuguese sources mention the demographic split, and sometimes rivalry, between the Muslim minority of the coast and the native pagan heathen majority of the island, with their notorious practice of cannibalism. According to Afonso de Albuquerque the rulers of the small kingdoms of northern Sumatra and the Sultans of Malacca used to have cannibals as executioners, reserved as a punishment for special crimes: ""There are in Malacca ... others are boiled, others are roasted and given to eat to peoples who are like savages and come from a country called Aru.""

The Portuguese record Suma Oriental, written in the early 16th century mentions Aru as a prosperous kingdom with plenty of rice, meat, fish and wine. The kingdom was also rich in camphor, benzoin, gold, lignaloes, rattan, honey and slaves. According to the Suma Oriental, Aru governed a town in the land of Arqat, where a large slave market was held in certain months. Many people went there to buy slaves, while other people went there to pay ransom to buy the freedom of their relatives who were being sold as slaves. The coastal area of Aru kingdom was infested with Celates robbers.

Duarte Barbosa (1480–1521) wrote in 1516 that the kingdom of Aru was ruled by cannibal adherents of paganism. Two decades later, Mendes Pinto also recorded the presence of the people of ""Aaru"" on the northeast coast of Sumatra where he also visited the local Muslim king.

Decline

Aru steadily grew weaker in the 16th century, caught in a regional rivalry between more powerful neighbours — Portuguese Malacca and the Sultanate of Aceh. Because of the incessant pressure from Aceh in the early 16th century the capital of Aru moved inland, from coastal Kota Rentang to Benteng Putri Hijau. The fall of the port city of Kota Rentang to Aceh probably took place in 1539. Some historians suggest that this event marked the end of the Aru kingdom as a maritime power. Aru's influence was reduced and its influence became regional at best, and ceased to exist in the early 17th century due to various factors; including the rivalry with Aceh and other neighboring polities in Sumatra and Malay peninsula, coupled with the loss of its coastal port that isolated the kingdom from the global maritime trading network.

In 1564, Aru kingdom was defeated by Ottomans during the Ottoman expedition to Aceh. In 1613, the ambitious and warlike Sultan Iskandar Muda of Aceh, strike a final blow to seal the fate of Aru kingdom. The discovery of tin bullets suggests that Benteng Putri Hijau was a battle site. Aru kingdom was dissolved in the early 17th century. Its successor state was the Deli which was reduced to the status of an Aceh protectorate (1632–1669) and later conquered by Siak (1669–1854).

Society

Religion
Within the Kingdom of Aru, there were three religions recognised by its people: Islam, the faith adhered to by kingdom's elites, the royal family and coastal society; Hinduism adhered to by Tamil settlers; and native pagan animism practiced by the Karonese population of the hinterland. The Kingdom of Aru was initially built upon the larger Karo society, which was a pagan animist culture. The traditional animist belief system of Karonese is called Pemena.

The Chinese Ming source Yingya Shenglan (1416) mentioned that the King of Aru and his subjects had embraced Islam. The conversion to Islam most likely took place earlier, probably in the late 13th century. Islamic gravestones discovered in Kota Rentang confirmed that Islamic society had taken firm root in the kingdom.

Archaeological excavation has uncovered fragments of lingam, which suggests that part of Aru's society, possibly Tamil settlers, adhered to Hinduism. Tamil traders settled in the kingdom, bringing Hindu influences with them, and they had integrated into Aru society.

Economy and way of life
The people of Aru made their living by fishing and farming. However, since their lands were not suitable for rice farming, most of them grew coconuts and bananas instead, or forest commodities such as rattan, camphor and frankincense. They raised poultry, ducks and goats, and they consumed milk. When they went into the forest, they used poisonous arrows and bows for protection. Both men and women covered their bodies by wrapping their lower limbs in cloth, however the upper parts were left uncovered. They traded their commodities for foreign goods, including Chinese ceramics, silk and colourful beads.

Archaeological findings and artifacts show that the Aru kingdom had established trading relations with India and China. According to a Chinese source, compared to Malacca and Pasai, Aru was not a great center of commerce. It seems that Aru failed to compete with Malacca and Pasai to attract regional and global Muslim traders. This led Aru kings to occasionally turn to piracy and raiding, aided by the Orang Laut, sea gypsies aligned to Aru.

Culture
The Chinese sources mention that the culture of Aru, areas such as customs, marriage and funeral traditions, language and trade, are quite similar to those of Malacca, Pasai and Java. The natural resources and commodities being traded there are also similar to those of the other polities in the region.

According to the Malay Annals, Aru kingdom adopted the etiquette and culture of the Malay court; their kings used Malay styles and titles such as ""Raja Pahlawan"" and ""Sri Indra"". However, this Malay acculturation was not complete, as traces of non-Malay culture, the native Karonese elements, survive to this day.

Aru maintained close cultural and trading relations with their kin in the hinterlandthe Karo people of Karolandat a time when they still practiced a native form of animism and paganism, which included a notorious practice of ritualised cannibalism. Thus, from the perspective of foreign records, the Aru country was notoriously known as the origin of savage cannibals.

The Magic Monastery with the subtitle Analogical and Action Philosophy of the Middle East and Central Asia, contains traditional teaching stories as well as pieces composed by Idries Shah. The author writes in the preface: ""It consists of a representative cross-section of Sufi teaching which constitutes a harmonized whole rather than a selection of typical extracts.""

Reception
In the August 1972 edition of Encounter magazine, Doris Lessing described the work as ""a particularly and intriguingly informative"" ""textbook for students"".

The book was featured in The Observer Review'''s Book of the Year on 17 December 1972, where it was described as ""remarkable for its precise response to the real and inner needs of the time.""

In October 1972, writing in the journal Asian Affairs, historian L. F. Rushbrook Williams described The Magic Monastery as ""accurately expressing Sufi thought and practice in vivid terms easily comprehensible to readers"" and wrote that it illustrates ""the manner in which Sufi practice, with its devastating criticism of purely academic learning and its continuing Socratic search for truth at any cost, exercises a powerful appeal to many thoughtful people in the West.""

On June 5, 1972, the Worcester Evening News wrote that book contained ""an enormous amount of commonsense"" and that the reader ""will become amused, educated, immersed.""

A reviewer wrote in the Huddersfield Daily Examiner on 22 June 1972 that the book ""offers much in the way of contemplation and hope, a respite from the ills of modern society.""

In the London Evening News on 5 April 5, 1972, the reviewer wrote that the book ""...prob[ed] gently into deeper levels of the mind and echo[ed] with what might be conscience.""

In the Kingston Borough News, on 19 January 1973, the reviewer was of the opinion that ""You won't be quite the same person when you have read this book."" and rated the work as ""Highly recommended.""

Writer, novelist and philosopher, Colin Wilson in his review of The Magic Monastery noted that Shah ""is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... The Sufis transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces.""

Noted psychiatrist Arthur Deikman, in his book The Observing Self, also mentions tales found in The Magic Monastery'' as examples of stories that can indirectly communicate important teachings, for instance, by illustrating the difficulty in describing mystical perception to those who've never experienced it.

53,132,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type8,"Juan de Courten (younger) was a Spanish general who led an infantry division during the Peninsular War against the First French Empire. In 1810, he was promoted to mariscal de campo, a Spanish rank between brigadier general and lieutenant general, and therefore equivalent to major general. The following year he was captured at the conclusion of the Siege of Tarragona. In 1818, he received an important military decoration.

Career
Courten was appointed mariscal de campo, which is roughly the same as a major general in 1810. On 10 December 1810, the Army of Catalonia consisted of Courten's 4,791-man division, Pedro Sarsfield's 5,462-strong division, Joaquín Ibáñez Cuevas y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles' 2,538-man division, and 13,040 soldiers in various garrisons. The army commander, Luis González Torres de Navarra, Marquess of Campoverde received word from a Spanish official in Barcelona that a French officer was ready to admit a force into one of the forts. Accordingly, Campoverde marched Courten's and Sarsfield's divisions close to the city on 19 March 1811. A force of 800 grenadiers was assembled and sent silently forward to surprise the Monjuich fortress. As the Spanish soldiers entered the ditch, the area was suddenly lit by torches and the French garrison opened fire. Spanish losses numbered 100 killed and wounded, plus four officers and a number of enlisted men captured. The Frenchman had only pretended to betray his country, allowing the trap to be sprung on the hapless Spanish soldiers. The Spanish official was executed immediately afterward.

On 28 April, Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet advanced from Lérida with the divisions of Jean Isidore Harispe and Bernard-Georges-François Frère. The French reached Reus on 2 May and pushed back the Spanish outpost line around Tarragona the next day. With his 4,500 men and the garrison troops, Courten could muster only 7,000 men for the city's defense. In the face of Suchet's superior force he intelligently immured himself within the city. At this time, his division consisted of three battalions of the Granada Line Infantry Regiment, and two battalions each of the Almanza, Almeria, and America Line Infantry Regiments.

Tarragona was a very strong position, but its walls were too long for soldiers immediately available to defend it. The walls enclosed both the upper and lower towns. The upper town stood on a steep hill while the lower town had access to a good harbor. The lower town was protected by six bastions and the upper town had an outer line of forts in front of the walls. On a dominating height  to the north was the powerful Fort Olivo, defended by 1,000 troops. The division of Pierre-Joseph Habert soon arrived with the French heavy artillery and the Siege of Tarragona began. Harispe's division faced Fort Olivo and the east side of the city, Habert took position on the west side facing the lower town, while Frère covered the center. An Anglo-Spanish naval squadron under Edward Codrington consisting of two third-rates, two frigates, and gunboats stood offshore to provide logistic and gunfire support. On 10 May Campoverde arrived by ship with 4,000 troops to take over the defense.

On 28 June, French troops led by Habert stormed into the upper city and beat down all opposition. Contreras was wounded and captured. As the disaster unfolded, Courten with 3,000 troops tried to implement the breakout plan and emerged from the eastern gate of the city. As his soldiers made their way along the shore, they were blocked by an Italian brigade and set upon by French cavalry. A number of soldiers jumped into the water and were rescued by ship's boats from the naval squadron. Others were cut down by the horsemen but most surrendered with Courten. Of his original division, only 1,793 men survived the siege to be captured by the French. Suchet recorded the prisoners as follows, 613 from Almanza, 464 from Almeria, 365 from Granada, and 351 from America.   
     
In 1818, King Ferdinand VII of Spain awarded Courten the Caballeros Grandes Cruces (Knight's Grand Cross) of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild.

The corner of Arizona Avenue/SR 87 and Ocotillo Boulevard was coined ""Hamilton's Corner"".

As the Phoenix area became more populated, Chandler High School was unable to handle the increasing educational needs. Voters in 1996 granted Chandler Unified School District (CUSD) a $33 million USD bond to purchase 359,341 ft2 (3,338.3 m2) property and awarded Stantec construction contract for the original Hamilton High School campus.  The school becoming operational in 1998 with Fred DePrez as principal and 1,600 freshmen through junior level students.

Academics

Hamilton abides by the standards set by the Arizona Department of Education and implements the state's Education and Career Action Plan (ECAP) required for all students 9-12 grade students to graduate from a public Arizona high school. CUSD high schools also implements an open enrollment policy, meaning students from outside the intended school boundaries may attend without tuition or other penalties.

Arizona requires that all high school students take 6 credit bearing courses during their freshmen through junior years, and have the option of reducing credits to 4 credit bearing courses if they are track for graduation.

Likewise, Economics credits can be awarded like Agricultural Business Management, Business, Business Applications, Marketing, Economics Applications, Family and Consumer Sciences, and vocational courses.

Community college credits can be awarded through a partnership with Chandler-Gilbert Community College (CGCC) and cooperative credits for vocational courses are provided by East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT). Students must be dually enrolled for the Arizona community college or the Arizona public university system to accept the credits towards a degree. CUSD Transportation Department provides routes between Hamilton, EVIT, and CGCC with after school hours transportation intended for students participating in activities.

Separate from EVIT and CGCC, the University of Arizona implemented a pilot program to get university credits for students pursuing introductory engineering courses starting in 2014.

Campus 
Hamilton was constructed by Stantec on a $33 million USD bond issued to CUSD on a 359,341 ft2 (3,338.3 m2) property on the northwest corner of Arizona Avenue/SR 87 and Ocotillo Boulevard. The main building is two stories tall with an administrative wing (A-wing) on the bottom floor next to the main entrance. Students have the option of eating indoors or in a shaded patio and food services with supporting facilities in (B-wing) offer students 6 styles of food.

Also on the ground floor is the special education classrooms for developmentally challenged students with licensed speech, occupational, and physical therapists adhering to Title I.

All of the performing arts like concert band, orchestra, gymnastics, dance, and art are located on the southeast portion of the main building (H-wing) surrounding the 600-seat auditorium. Also locker rooms and a small wight lifting room surround the gym (G-Wing). In the northern parking lot are double wide mobile classrooms (M-Wing) due to the large student population.

CUSD was granted a $192 million USD bond in November 2015 for district wide construction and updates. Hamilton was allocated $4.5 million for a two-story building (N-wing) with a 20 classroom and additional administration offices 27,530 ft2 (2,557.6 m2) located on what was the original outdoor concrete basketball courts.

Sports facilities

The album contains a cover of ""Flowers on the Wall"", originally recorded by the Statler Brothers in 1965. Heatherly's cover was released as the album's lead-off single, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart and number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second and third singles were the title track and ""Wrong Five O'Clock"", which respectively reached numbers 46 and 32 on the country chart. The album peaked at number 157 on the Billboard 200.

Production
The album was produced by Keith Stegall. Heatherly cowrote every song aside from the Statler Brothers cover.

Critical reception
Country Standard Time wrote that ""the barroom anthems are tempered by the beautiful title ballad and the first single, a reworking of the Statler Brothers classic, 'Flowers On The Wall', that is different enough to succeed in the face of the original."" The Morning Call thought that ""trafficking in typical rock-country hybrids, this freshly minted singer-songwriter pens tunes that tell a story, not unlike, say, John Mellencamp, Tom Petty or Johnny Cash.""

48,137,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type6,"The Spanish West Indies or the Spanish Antilles (also known as ""Las Antillas Occidentales"" or simply ""Las Antillas Españolas"" in Spanish) were Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. In terms of governance of the Spanish Empire, The Indies was the designation for all its overseas territories and was overseen by the Council of the Indies, founded in 1524 and based in Spain. When the Crown established the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535, the islands of the Caribbean came under its jurisdiction. 

The islands ruled by Spain were chiefly the Greater Antilles such as Hispaniola (inclusive of modern-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The majority of the indigenous populations on these islands had died out or had mixed with the European colonizers by 1520. Spain also claimed the Lesser Antilles (such as Guadalupe and the Cayman Islands) but these smaller islands remained largely independent until they were conquered in the late 17th and early 18th century by other European nations.

The islands that became the Spanish West Indies were the focus of the voyages of the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus in America. Largely due to the familiarity that Spaniards gained from Columbus's voyages, the islands were also the first lands to be permanently colonized by Spanish in the Americas. The Spanish West Indies were also the most enduring part of Spain's American Empire, only being surrendered in 1898 at the end of the Spanish–American War. For over three centuries, Spain controlled a network of ports in the Caribbean including Havana (Cuba), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Cartagena de Indias, Veracruz (Mexico), and Portobelo, Panama, which were connected by galleon routes.

Some smaller islands were seized or ceded to other European powers as a result of war, or diplomatic agreements during the 17th and 18th centuries. Others such as Dominican Republic gained their independence in the 19th century.

Change of sovereignty or independence 
 The Bay Islands were ceded to England in 1643 and then to Honduras in 1861.
 Colony of Santiago—Jamaica was captured by England in 1655, confirmed in the Treaty of Madrid (1670).
 The Cayman Islands were ceded to England in the Treaty of Madrid (1670).
 Haiti (western Hispaniola) was ceded to France in the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697 (Saint-Domingue).
 Trinidad was captured by Britain during the invasion of Trinidad, confirmed in the Treaty of Amiens in 1802.
 Captaincy General of Santo Domingo (eastern Hispaniola) was ceded to France during the War of the First Coalition. It would later be returned to Spain, and gained its independence from Spain as Spanish Haiti in 1821, then from Haiti as the Dominican Republic, and again from Spain at the end of the Dominican Restoration War in 1865, when the second Dominican Republic was proclaimed.
 Captaincy General of Cuba was lost to the United States in 1898, after the Spanish–American War concluded by the 1898 Treaty of Paris.
 Captaincy General of Puerto Rico was lost to the United States in 1898, after the Spanish–American War concluded by the 1898 Treaty of Paris.

Spanish Caribbean 

Today, the term Spanish Caribbean or Hispanophone Caribbean refers to the Spanish-speaking areas in the Caribbean Sea, chiefly Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico. An even broader definition can include the Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, & Panama), and South America (Colombia and Venezuela), however aside from Panama, Venezuela, and parts of Colombia, most of these countries share little with the Spanish speaking Caribbean islands culturally. It includes regions where Spanish is the main language, and where the legacy of Spanish settlement and colonization influences culture, through religion, language, cuisine, and so on. The varieties of Spanish that predominate in this region are known collectively as Caribbean Spanish. 

The Spanish Caribbean (Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico) can be considered a separate subregion of Latin America, culturally distinct from both continental Spanish speaking countries and the non-Spanish speaking Caribbean. Apart from culture, the Spanish Caribbean is different racially as well. In comparison to the predominantly black majority of the Non-Hispanic Caribbean, but with similarities to the multi-racial continental areas of Latin America, mixed-race people are most dominant in this region. However, like the majority of the Caribbean, there are still large populations of unmixed Black people and extremely large amounts of undeniable African cultural influences. The Spanish Caribbean also has higher Canarian influence compared to continental Latin America, making them the primary European ancestral group. And more French ancestry, due to white French fleeing Haiti after independence to the surrounding Hispanic Caribbean, around 18% of surnames in the Spanish Caribbean are of French origin, second highest after Spanish. This mixture of European (especially Canarian), West African, and Taino, is heavily reflected in the culture.

The term is used in contrast to Anglophone Caribbean, French Caribbean, and Dutch Caribbean, which are other modern linguistic divisions of the Caribbean region. The Hispanophone Caribbean is a part of the wider Hispanic America, which includes all the Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas. Historically, coastal areas of Spanish Florida and the Caribbean South America (cf. the Spanish Main) were closely tied to the Spanish Caribbean. During the period of Spanish settlement and colonization of the New World, the Spanish West Indies referred to those settlements in islands of the Caribbean Sea under political administration of Spain, as in the phrase ""a 1765 cedula authorized seven sea ports, in addition to the port of San Juan, to trade with the Spanish Caribbean."" Until the early 19th century these territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.

In a modern sense, the Caribbean islands of Colombia could be included in the Hispanophone Caribbean as well, due to the fact they are located in the Caribbean, but not in the Antilles.

Islands 

Below is a list of islands belonging geographically to the Greater and Lesser Antilles and that were under Spanish rule in various stages of history, until it became independent from Spain. Several islands which were previously largely under Spanish rule, but since they were passed into the domain of France, England or the Netherlands, are no longer considered part of the Spanish Caribbean.

In addition, the Colombian islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina are located in the Caribbean, but are not part of the Antilles. Under intermittent periods of Spanish rule, these islands were administered as part of the Spanish Main (initially Guatemala, later New Granada).

First published in 1962, it has gone through ten editions; as of 2006 there are over eight million copies in print, making it the publisher's best-selling anthology. M. H. Abrams, a critic and scholar of Romanticism, served as General Editor for its first seven editions, before handing the job to Stephen Greenblatt, a Shakespeare scholar and Harvard professor. The anthology provides an overview of poetry, drama, prose fiction, essays, and letters from Beowulf to the beginning of the 21st century.

Format

1st edition
The first edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature, printed in 1962, comprised two volumes. Also printed in 1962 was a single-volume derivative edition, called The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Major Authors Edition, which contained reprintings with some additions and changes including 28 of the major authors appearing in the original edition.

7th edition
The seventh edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature comprises six volumes, sold in two sets of three. The first set includes the volumes ""The Middle Ages"", ""The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century"", and ""Restoration and the Eighteenth Century""; the second set includes ""The Romantic Period"", ""The Victorian Age"", and ""The Twentieth Century and After"". The writings are arranged by author, with each author presented chronologically by date of birth. Historical and biographical information is provided in a series of headnotes for each author and in introductions for each of the time periods.

Within this structure, the anthology incorporates a number of thematically linked ""clusters"" of texts pertaining to significant contemporary concerns. For example, ""The Sixteenth Century and The Early Seventeenth Century"" contains four such clusters under the headings, ""Literature of The Sacred"", ""The Wider World"", ""The Science of Self and World"", and ""Voices of the War"". The first of these includes four contemporary English translations of an identical passage from the Bible, those of William Tyndale, the Geneva Bible, the Douay–Rheims Version, and the Authorized (King James) Version; selections from the writings of influential Protestant thinkers of the period, including Tyndale, John Calvin, Anne Askew, John Foxe and Richard Hooker; as well as selections from the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Homilies.

The seventh edition was also sold in two volumes, which simply compressed six eras into two larger volumes, each volume comprising three eras. Volume 1 comprised the selection of literature from ""'The Middle Ages"" to the ""English Restoration and the Eighteenth Century"", while Volume 2 included the selection of literature from ""The Romantic Period"" to ""The Twentieth Century and After"".

Another option was the ""Major Authors"" edition. Compressed into the single volume was a selection of major authors of each period, from the anonymous author of Beowulf to J. M. Coetzee.

9th edition
The ninth edition continues to be sold in the same format as the eighth edition.

10th edition
The tenth edition of the anthology went on sale in June 2018 and has continued to be sold in the same format as its two prior editions, while adding a host of new writers to its already substantially eclectic range.

History
Published in 1962, the first edition of Norton Anthology was based on an English literature survey course Abrams and fellow editor David Daiches taught at Cornell University. The anthology underwent periodic revisions every few years. The fifth edition in 1986 included the addition of the full texts of James Joyce's ""The Dead"" and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The sixth edition, published in 1993, included Nadine Gordimer and Fleur Adcock. The seventh edition added Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf, Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, and Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart.

Greenblatt joined the editorial team during the 1990s: ""When Norton asked Greenblatt—who was already editor of 'The Norton Shakespeare'—to join the team as Abrams's deputy in the mid-90s, Abrams said he was initially skeptical because of their different critical approaches, but quickly came around. The two had first met in the 80s, when they once delivered opposing lectures. 'It was great fun,' Abrams said. 'He always claimed that I bent his sword. I always claimed he had the better, not of the argument, but of the rhetoric of the argument.'"" Another addition has been an increase in women writers: ""The new edition, Greenblatt said, includes 68 women writers, more than eight times as many as in the first edition.""

The ninth edition was released in 2012, marking 50 years of the anthology's existence.

Competing anthologies
The 1970s saw the emergence of The Oxford Anthology of English Literature; its editorial team included leading scholars Harold Bloom, Frank Kermode, and Lionel Trilling. It was discontinued. Bloom, a former student of Abrams', noted: ""We were defeated in battle.""

The Longman Anthology of British Literature is also a competitor. Of this relationship, Joyce Jensen of The New York Times wrote in 1999, ""The first stone in the war between Longman and W. W. Norton, the David and Goliath of the anthology publishing world, has been cast. With the recent publication of The Longman Anthology of British Literature, Longman has mounted a challenge to Norton to become the literary anthology of choice in colleges and universities around the country."" Longman Anthology editor David Damrosch commented on the seventh edition of The Norton Anthology, arguing:

The Norton Anthology responded that:

Independent Canadian publisher Broadview Press also offers a six-volume anthology of British literature that competes with the Norton and Longman anthologies, and a two-volume Concise Edition that competes with Norton's two-volume Major Authors Edition and Longman's two-volume Masters of British Literature. The editorial team for The Broadview Anthology of British Literature includes leading scholars such as Kate Flint, Jerome J. McGann, and Anne Lake Prescott and has in general been very well received, though its sales have yet to match those of the competitors from the two larger publishers.

Reception
In 2006, Rachel Donadio of The New York Times stated: ""Although assailed by some for being too canonical and by others for faddishly expanding the reading list, the anthology has prevailed over the years, due in large part to the talents of Abrams, who refined the art of stuffing 13 centuries of literature into 6,000-odd pages of wispy cigarette paper.""

Sarah A. Kelen summarizes the changes to the NAEL inclusions of medieval literature through successive editions, demonstrating the way the Anthology contents reflect contemporary scholarship.

Sean Shesgreen, an English professor at Northern Illinois University, published a critical history of the anthology in the Winter 2009 issue of Critical Inquiry, based on interviews with Abrams and examinations of the editor's NAEL files. Norton president Drake McFeely forcefully denounced the article in a January 23, 2009 story in The Chronicle of Higher Education.

1976 birthsThe Mercedes D.III, or F1466 as it was known internally, was a six-cylinder, SOHC valvetrain liquid-cooled inline aircraft engine built by Daimler and used on a wide variety of German aircraft during World War I. The initial versions were introduced in 1914 at 160 hp, but a series of changes improved this to 170 hp in 1917, and 180 by mid-1918. These later models were used on almost all late-war German fighters, and its only real competition, the BMW III, was available only in very limited numbers. Compared to the Allied engines it faced, the D.III was generally outdated.

Design and development
The D.III was based on the same pattern as the earlier Mercedes D.II, suitably scaled up for higher power settings. Like most inlines of the era, it used a large aluminum crankcase as the main structural component, with separate cylinders made from steel bolted onto it. The technology for screwing a threaded cylinder of steel into an aluminum crankcase did not exist at that time. Jackets for cooling water covered the top 2/3 of the cylinder, feeding a radiator via connections at the back of the engine. The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders.

The D.III featured a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single intake and exhaust valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft at the rear of the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The ignition cables were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.

Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.

Production variants

The original D.III was introduced in 1914. While it saw widespread use in early examples of the C-series of two-seat general-purpose biplanes, the D.III was too large for contemporary fighter designs and did not see use in that role. At the time, fighters were generally powered by lighter rotary engines of power output levels from 80 to about 110 hp, or by water-cooled inline engines in the 100 to 120 hp range such as the earlier Mercedes D.II. By 1916 new designs had grown in size and performance and the D.III became popular on new designs. By 1917 the D.III was being widely used in fighters, most notably on the famous Albatros D.I. Production of this version was essentially wound down by May 1917, with only a handful continuing to be delivered until October. British HP ratings being slightly different (with 746 watts = 1 hp) to the German PS or Pferdestärke standard of roughly 735 watts per PS horsepower, it is probable that this engine would have had a slightly higher rating under British HP numbers.  Fuel consumption was 11.75 gallons per hour.  Its compression ratio was 4.5:1.

Development of the basic design led to the slightly modified 170 hp D.IIIa, which took over on the production lines in June 1917. The main change was to change the piston profile to have a flat head instead of the former concave one, thereby slightly increasing maximum compression to 4.64:1. Other changes were mainly in design details, notably a redesigned crankcase and new carburetor. Many of the accessories were also redesigned or moved around on the engine. This model was produced only briefly, for use on the Albatros D.III but there are indications that possibly some early Albatros (Alb.) made Fokker D.VII's were also equipped but probably had the engines upgraded or replaced as quickly as possible.  This engine has been referred to in postwar British analysis as generating 180 hp.

A more ""radical"" upgrade was the 180/200 hp D.IIIaü, introduced in late 1917, the D.IIIaü was a standardized refinement of the D.III and D.IIIa design and the ü designation was never official. This engine changed the pistons again, this time to a domed profile that further increased the maximum compression – the ü was for ""über"", meaning ""overcompressed"". Additionally, a new altitude-compensating carburetor was added, which improved performance at higher altitudes. To support operations at these altitudes, water from the radiator was used to heat the air intake and prevent icing in the carburetor. The aü model, which included upgraded D.III and D.IIIa engine blocks, was the most prolific German fighter engine of 1918 and designed into most fighter designs from late 1917 on. This included most of the entries in the First Fighter Competition at Adlershof in January 1918, notably the famed Fokker D.VII. In British post war evaluation the D.IIIaü demonstrated 200 hp according to the British standards.

A final version attempting to keep the D.III block competitive was the 200 hp (200-217 hp) D.IIIav (or avü), introduced mid-October 1918. The av used slightly longer pistons made of aluminum (possibly a first for a production engine), increasing the compression yet again, while at the same time allowing them to move faster due to the reduced weight. The maximum allowable RPM increased from 1,400 in the earlier models to 1,600 in the av, accounting for most of the gains in power. It is unclear if any av's saw service use.  The increased use of Benzol in German aviation fuel may have helped this final upgrade of power, its higher octane rating being better suited for the higher compression ratio.

External differences between models

All of the D.III series were generally very similar to other models, with the exception of the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then.  The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier ""side-slot"" rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, rocker boxes, rocker arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier ""side-slot"" cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical ""slotless"" rocker-box overhead cam valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.

Confusingly, the ""ü"" was not an official part of the name. This leads to a number of problems in various references, which often confuse the IIIa with the IIIaü, listing the former as a 180 hp engine. There are two D.IV engines — from the IdFlieg aircraft powerplant class designations based on power output — one the straight-eight based on the 140mm bore D.III pistons; and the later, six-cylinder Mercedes D.IVa with 160mm bore cylinders, which was essentially unrelated.

The D.III line of engines would find themselves eclipsed in performance by the BMW IIIa of 185 and then 200 hp (British rated it at 230HP) in 1918, however, the small number of BMW's produced ensured that the Mercedes D.III series would be the primary German fighter engine up to the last month or two of the war and it would still be seen in very large numbers even at the end.  At the end of the war the D.IIIaü would still be the numerically predominant German fighter engine.  As a result, the Fokker D.VII's (those not equipped with BMW IIIa's) and the Pfalz D.XII's would be engine-limited in performance (as opposed to ""airframe-limited"") and yet would still be formidable adversaries to their Allied counterparts. The D.IIIaü was considered the optimum engine for the Roland D.VI, Pfalz D.IIIa, and Albatros D.Va fighters, whose airframes were of an earlier, ""all-wood"" generation in design.

BasketballSándor Kulcsár (also known as Alexandru Culcear; born 16 July 1965) is a Romanian former professional football player and manager of Hungarian ethnicity.

Club career
Born in Pericei, Kulcsár started his football career at FC Bihor Oradea for which he played in two Liga II season. In the 1987–88 season he scored 23 goals for the red and blues, being transferred at Victoria București, club owned by the miliția and managed by Dumitru Dragomir. Every player that signed with Victoria was automatically enrolled in the miliția, but Kulcsár was a Hungarian ethnic, so the Romanian Communist Party forced him to change his name into one with a Romanian resonance, being known between 1988 and 1990 as Alexandru Culcear. In 1990 the Ceaușescu's dictatorship fell and Victoria was dissolved, being accused of misleading performances. Kulcsár returned for 2 seasons at Bihor Oradea until the club relegated in the second league. From 1992 until his retirement Sándor played in Hungary for various clubs such as: Békéscsaba Előre, Diósgyőr, Ferencváros or Nyíregyháza Spartacus, among others.

Manager career
In 2009 he was for a short period the assistant manager of Ovidiu Lazăr at Bihor Oradea.

62,141,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type5,"Alan Haynes (February 19, 1956), born in Houston, Texas, is an American Texas blues guitarist. Haynes has been playing professionally since the 1970s and has performed with a variety of blues musicians that include Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Albert Collins, Albert King, The Fabulous Thunderbirds (1980's version with Jimmie Vaughan), Robert Cray, Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker, and Otis Rush among others. He now resides in Austin, Texas, and plays locally in and around Texas' major cities, especially Houston (where he performs nearly every month), occasionally in Dallas and Fort Worth, and also Europe, where he has a following in Scandinavian countries, Germany, Denmark and Israel.

Life and career

Early life 

Haynes started playing guitar at the age of eight and approached the blues for the first time when he was about 12. Among the first influences he had were B. B. King, Freddie King, and Albert King, as well as fellow Houston native Albert Collins. By the age of 16, Haynes decided to dedicate himself to the blues.

Adult life and career 
In the late 1970s, Haynes joined the Texas Boogie Band as a second guitarist but eventually became the main guitarist. He moved to Austin, Texas in the early 1980s. While playing with the Texas Boogie Band, Haynes got to open and share the stage with Muddy Waters. Haynes and the Texas Boogie Band were, by that time, the house band at the Texas Opry House, also getting radio broadcasting in Houston (on 101KLOL). Haynes would later lead his own band, ""Alan Haynes and the Stepchildren"" and release his first EP, ""Seventh Son"" in 1984 under the Orphan label. Stepchildren included Uncle John Turner, who had played with Johnny Winter during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and recorded albums. Haynes was inducted into the ""Buddy magazine Texas Tornado List"" in 1980 and his band was voted ""Best Blues Band"" by the ""Music City Austin - Music Poll"" in 1985. Later on, for about six years in the 1990s, Haynes was the house band at Antone's. During those years, in 1994, Haynes released his second studio album, Wishing Well. This time he had life friends and former Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble rhythm sections Chris Layton on drums, Tommy Shannon on bass, and Reese Wynans on keyboards. Haynes also counted on Preston Hubbard from the Fabulous Thunderbirds and George Rains (Jimmie Vaughan's drummer) for this album. The result earned Haynes a featured article in the Guitar Player in August 1995. He continued playing locally and in Europe and recorded two more albums on his own, but this time capturing the emotions of live performances. These two, Live at the Blue Cat Blues recorded in Dallas in 1998 with Jim Suhler, and Live at the Big Easy recorded in Houston in 2001, were Haynes' last works to date.

Style and technique 
Haynes' style is a soulful mix of Texas blues that includes musical ideas from different genres, essentially jazz and southern country. Haynes' tone is relatively clean and very clear as he uses no effects between his guitars and amps. The use of different dynamics and long, intense jams after singing a few verses has been a constant throughout his career. Haynes is also well known for being a master of slide guitar and usually plays a few tunes with the slide in his regular sets. Haynes' playing style is also denoted by precision on his bends, a wide range and variety of licks and tight rhythms that he achieves through complex chord-arrangements. Another component of his playing is his heavy and masterful use of his fingers to play (instead of a pick, which he also uses) and several pickup switches while playing licks and chords that allows him to achieve different sounds.

Musical influences 
Haynes' main influence is Johnny Winter, who he was introduced to at the age of 15 by fellow Houstonian, Benny Valerio. This influence is evident in both his fluent and aggressive playing and growling vocals which he tends to harmonize with his guitar. Albert Collins is another big influence that can be traced on Haynes's bends and vibratos as well as his fresh tone. Others that have influenced his career and style are Albert King, Muddy Watters, Freddie King, B. B. King, T-Bone Walker, and Lightnin' Hopkins.

Equipment 
Haynes sound is characterized by a warm tone achieved by playing vintage Strats through vintage Fender amps. His main guitar is a 1960 Fender Stratocaster with a C-Profile rosewood fret board and Dakota Red body. It was previously owned by Stevie Ray Vaughan and prior to him, it belonged to Eric Johnson. The guitar has also been played by Billy Gibbons, Carlos Santana and Johnny Winter. Pickups on this guitar are stock and therefore have a vintage sound. His favorite amp setup includes a Fender Vibroking and an Ibanez Tube Screamer Mini. Previously a heavy strings user (11's and 12's), Haynes now employs any 10-46 set of strings and prefers standard tuning.

History

Origins 
The old unmetalled road between Ludwigslust and Parchim was upgraded in 1845 to a surfaced road. One year later roadworks were completed as far as Lübz and, in 1936, the first road bridge over the Elbe was opened in Dömitz .

Old routes and names 
In 1937 the road was designated as Reichsstraße 191. During the division of Germany it was interrupted at the Inner German Border where the Elbe bridge had been partly destroyed in an airstrike in April 1945. The western section between Celle and the banks of the Elbe near Dannenberg (Elbe) belonged to West Germany and was called the Bundesstraße 191. The eastern section between Dömitz and Plau am See belonged to East Germany and was known as Fernverkehrsstraße 191 (abbr: F 191).

Since the rebuilding of the 970 m long Elbe Bridge at Dömitz in 1992 it has been possible to drive along this federal highway from end to end.

43,142,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type5,"A latifundium is a very extensive parcel of privately owned land. The latifundia (Latin: latus, ""spacious"" and fundus, ""farm, estate"") of Roman history were great landed estates specializing in agriculture destined for export: grain, olive oil, or wine. They were characteristic of Magna Graecia and Sicily, Egypt, Northwest Africa and Hispania Baetica. The latifundia were the closest approximation to industrialized agriculture in Antiquity, and their economics depended upon slavery.

During the modern colonial period, the European monarchies often rewarded services with extensive land grants in their empires. The forced recruitment of local labourers allowed by colonial law made these land grants particularly lucrative for their owners. These grants, fazendas (in Portuguese) or haciendas (in Spanish), were also borrowed as loanwords, Portuguese latifúndios and Spanish latifundios or simply fundos.

Agrarian reforms aimed at ending the dominance of the latifundia system are still a popular goal of several national governments around the world.

Ancient Rome

The basis of the latifundia in Spain and Sicily was the ager publicus that fell to the dispensation of the state through Rome's policy of war in the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD. As much as a third of the arable land of a new province was taken for agri publici and then divided up with at least the fiction of a competitive auction for leaseholdings rather than outright ownership. Later in the Empire, as leases were inherited, ownership of the former common lands became established by tradition, and the leases became taxable.

The first latifundia were accumulated from the spoils of war, confiscated from conquered peoples beginning in the early 2nd century BC. The prototypical latifundia were the Roman estates in Magna Graecia (the south of Italy) and in Sicily, which distressed Pliny the Elder (died AD 79) as he travelled, seeing only slaves working the land, not the sturdy Roman farmers who had been the backbone of the Republic's army. Latifundia expanded with conquest, to the Roman provinces of Mauretania (modern Maghreb) and in Hispania Baetica (modern Andalusia).

Large villa rustica holdings in Campania, around Rome, in Cisalpine Gaul (the modern Po Valley) and in  Gallia Narbonensis were the base for a self-sufficient economy, similar to the haciendas of Latin America. They produced oil, wine or garum for export. The practice of establishing agricultural coloniae as a way to compensate Roman soldiers created smaller landholdings, which would then be acquired by large landowners in times of economic distress. Thus the direction, over time, was towards the consolidation of landholdings into larger units.

Latifundia could be devoted to livestock (sheep and cattle) or to the cultivation of olive oil, grain, and wine. However, in Italy, they did not produce grain. Rome had to import grain (in the Republican period, from Sicily and North Africa, in the Imperial era, from Egypt). Ownership of land, organized in the latifundia, defined the Roman Senatorial class. It was the only acceptable source of wealth for senators, though Romans of the elite class would set up their freedmen as merchant traders, and participate as silent partners in businesses from which senatores were disqualified.

The latifundia quickly started economic consolidation as larger estates achieved greater economies of scale and senators did not pay land taxes. Owners re-invested their profits by purchasing smaller neighbouring farms, since smaller farms had lower productivity and could not compete, in an ancient precursor of agribusiness. By the 2nd century AD, latifundia had replaced many small and medium-sized farms in some areas of the Roman Empire. As small farms were bought up by the wealthy with their vast supply of slaves, the newly landless peasantry moved to the city of Rome, where they became dependent on state subsidies. Overall, the latifundia increased productivity. Free peasants did not completely disappear: many became tenants on estates that were worked in two ways: partly directly controlled by the owner and worked by slaves and partly leased to tenants. It was one of the greatest levels of worker productivity before the 19th century. Such consolidation was not universally approved of, as it consolidated more and more land into fewer and fewer hands, mainly Senators and the Roman emperor. Efforts to reverse the trend by agrarian laws were generally unsuccessful. Pliny the Elder argued that the latifundia had ruined Italy and would ruin the Roman provinces as well. He reported that at one point just six owners possessed half of the province of Africa, which may be a piece of rhetorical exaggeration as the North African cities were filled with flourishing landowners who filled the town councils.

Pliny the Elder was very much against the profit-oriented estates described in the writings of Columella. His writings can be seen as a part of the 'conservative' reaction to the profit-oriented new attitudes of the upper classes of the Early Empire (Martin 1971
).

Ancient Greece
The landscape of the Greek mainland does not lend itself to large estates. Olive oil and wine for trade were typically produced by many small groves and vineyards, concentrated in fewer hands at the presses and shipping ports. The grasslands of Thessaly and Macedon were pasture for grazing horses. Meat was not a staple in Mediterranean diets.

During the Hellenistic period, latifundia were typical of the export-oriented agriculture of coastal Syria and the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.

Europe
In the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the largely self-sufficient villa-system of the latifundia remained among the few political-cultural centres of a fragmented Europe. These latifundia had been of great importance economically, until the long-distance shipping of wine and oil, grain and garum disintegrated, but extensive lands controlled in a single pair of hands still constituted power: it can be argued that the latifundia formed part of the economic basis of the European social, however there is no evidence of this. The gift of a villa, or of a series of them, owned by a powerful patron was at the basis of all the great monasteries and abbeys founded in Western Europe until the time of Charlemagne, when the land-gifts, significantly, tended to be of forest instead.

Italy
In the 6th century, Cassiodorus was able to apply his own latifundia to support his short-lived Vivarium in the heel of Italy. Shortly thereafter, Monte Cassino was founded in a former Imperial villa. 

In Sicily, latifundia dominated the island from medieval times. They were abolished by sweeping land reform mandating smaller farms in 1950–1962, funded from the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, the Italian government's development fund for southern Italy (1950–1984).

Spain
In the Iberian Peninsula, the Castilian Reconquista of Muslim territories provided the Christian kingdom with sudden extensions of land, which the kings ceded as rewards to nobility, mercenaries and military orders to exploit as latifundia, which had been first established as the commercial olive oil and grain latifundia of Roman Hispania Baetica. The gifts finished the traditional small private ownership of land, eliminating a social class that had also been typical of the al-Andalus period.

In the Iberian peninsula, the possessions of the Church did not pass to private ownership until the ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal (), the ""secularization"" of church-owned latifundia, which proceeded in pulses through the 19th century.

Big areas of Andalusia are still populated by an underclass of jornaleros, landless peasants who are hired by the latifundists as ""day workers"" for specific seasonal campaigns. The jornalero class has been fertile ground for socialism and anarchism. Still today, among the main Andalusian trade unions is the Rural Workers Union (Sindicato Obrero del Campo), a far-left group famous for their squatting campaigns in the town of Marinaleda, Province of Seville.

Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth
Following the Union of Lublin in 1569, large expanses of land in Ukraine came under the control of the Polish Crown, which allowed for their exploitation by the Polish nobility. Over the course of the 17th century, these lands came to be mainly concentrated in vast estates, now commonly referred to as Latifundia, which were owned by a small number of magnate families which came to be the dominant political and social group in the commonwealth. These estates were diminished following the Cossack uprisings of the 17th century and largely disappeared following Russia's annexation of the Lithuanian lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the close of the 18th century.

German Ostsiedlung
In the course of Ostsiedlung in the Germania Slavica, large plots of land were acquired by Germanic settlers giving rise to a landed gentry class called junker in what became known as East Elbia. After World War II, ethnic Germans were expulsed from areas east of the Oder Neisse line and a land reform in the German Democratic Republic removed the junker as a class by the collectivizing of agriculture.

Story 
It is 515 days after leaving Earth orbit, and Helena Russell and Maya are preparing for a formal party to be held the next evening.  Each models the gowns they have selected to wear. Helena suggests to Maya a different hairstyle might be more appealing to would-be suitor Tony Verdeschi; the Psychon woman uses her power of molecular transformation to instantly produce a new coiffure.  Their fun is interrupted by the red-alert klaxon.  By the time the senior staff has gathered in Command Centre, what started as a minor malfunction in the main electronics has grown into a cascading systems failure.  Alpha experiences complete life-support malfunction, then a total power loss.

A strange atmosphere pervades Command Centre.  The staff is overcome first by a wave of lightheadedness, then rendered completely immobile.  The eerie stillness is broken by a flare of energy, from which materialises a striking humanoid female.  She wanders among the involuntary tableau vivant, singling out Helena and Verdeschi.  They, like the rest, were affected by vertigo when falling under the alien power—and were supporting each other when frozen in place.  Presuming them to be lovers locked in an amorous embrace, she is satisfied with her discovery.

John Koenig revives first and confronts the intruder.  She assures him his people are fine and, with a nod, releases them from their paralysis.  After identifying herself as Zamara of the planet Vega, she declares the Moon has intruded upon her people's sphere of influence.  Koenig explains the incursion is by accident and without hostile intent.  She tells them Moonbase Alpha is being held in an electro force-field, which is not only suppressing their power but can immobilise their voluntary nervous systems.  Permitting them forty-eight hours of minimal life-support, Zamara haughtily announces two Alphans are required to return with her to Vega for an undisclosed purpose.

Koenig protests and is immobilised by the Vegan woman.  She selects the 'lovers' Verdeschi and Helena to accompany her.  They will travel via positronic transfer; all they have to do is wish it.  After some initial hesitation, they concentrate—and instantly find themselves standing in a spacious indoor garden on Vega.  Verdeschi looks out a frost-rimed window at a desolate snowscape.  Caressing his torso, Zamara informs him the temperature outside is always sub-zero and the atmosphere almost too thin to support life.  Within the city, they will find all they desire.

As Helena wanders amid the foliage, she is startled by a being with an immobile plastic face wearing a hooded grey coverall with the numeral '8' on the chest.  She then becomes aware of a well-built, arrogant male devouring her with his eyes.  The man, Zarl, informs her that the grey-clad being is a 'Number'—a simple automaton.  The Alphans are joined by other Vegans, all of them perfect physical specimens; the men bare-chested and virile, the women shapely and lithe.  More Numbers are called to bring food for the guests.  Attended to by Number Eight, Helena receives a whispered warning not to react as expected.  If she or her companion show aggression, the Vegans will kill them.

The food is deliberately vile and served with vicious jibes and intentional insults.  Helena manages to communicate with Verdeschi through meaningful looks and idiomatic word-play not to lose his temper.  On Moonbase, the environmental situation is grave.  Koenig orders a search of the entire installation for a device that could be generating the force-field.  Maya works to devise an alternative heat source that will not consume their dwindling oxygen.  An attempt to procure power-packs from the Eagles fails; with the travel-tube network non-operational, the launch pads are inaccessible.

On Vega, Verdeschi and Helena are escorted to a stark cell and locked in.  Finally alone, Helena relates the warning given her by Number Eight.  Wanting to find and question that robot, Verdeschi blasts the door open with his stun-gun.  He wonders why he was allowed to keep his weapon; she assumes the Vegans want them to use it in an act of violence.  They follow a Number through the city's corridors and into a cavern that serves as the robots' home.  When Helena asks them for help, Number Eight steps forward and removes his plastic mask—to uncover a humanoid face.  He reveals the Numbers are human and the Vegans are robots.

Eight tells them the tale of his ancestors.  When his people were overwhelmed by a sudden and severe climatic change, they built service robots and linked them with a complex computer.  The computers designed ever more advanced robots, which built even more sophisticated computers.  In the end, the physically perfect androids achieved sentience, learning human characteristics through observation—then enslaved the human population.  They want to eliminate their creators, but they have never been exposed to anger or hatred, and thus cannot kill.  The masks prevent the Vegans from seeing strong emotion should the humans let down their guard.

Eight warns the Alphans to be wary:  the androids will try to entice a demonstration of violence...then kill every last one of them.  While investigating the computer chamber, Verdeschi and Helena discover it is protected by a powerful energy barrier impervious to laser fire.  Zarl and Zamara appear, reproaching them for leaving their 'quarters'.  The Alphans' excuse is they are worried about their friends on the Moon and are trying to return there.  The androids tell them to simply desire it.  They do, and find themselves back on an Alpha that is powered up and running—and apparently deserted.

A quick search proves they are the only two people present.  Worse, calculations show the Moon is now two light-years distant from its previous position in the Vega system; they must have travelled through a time warp during the positronic transfer and arrived weeks in the future.  They can only speculate the rest of the Alpha population was taken down to the planet.  When they try to wish their return to Vega, nothing happens—the process has apparently been turned off.

They are, in fact, in a replica of Alpha.  By isolating them, the Vegans intend to foster suspicion, paranoia and murderous rage between them.  (Zarl finds the procedure cruel, but is convinced of its necessity by Zamara.)  Using circumstantial evidence, they manoeuvre Helena into believing the security chief gave her a drugged coffee.  Verdeschi is then made to assume the doctor sabotaged the life-support system.  This exercise in psychological warfare ends with the two friends hunting each other with lasers set to kill.  Thinking the other is unbalanced, each tries to humour the other.  Finally, realising that neither is responsible for the deeds the other accuses them of, they recognise the situation for what it is.  As the two gloat over their victory, the androids come out of hiding and Zamara admits failure—this time.

On Alpha, the temperature is below freezing and the air stale and dank.  Koenig receives a report of an intruder in the Recreation Section:  Zamara.  Her last experiment a failure, she is reviewing the entire micro-disc library for a literary example of humans driven to commit murder.  After a stun-gun blast has no effect on the android, she informs them all the Vegans are part of a complete and indestructible chain.  Her search ends with Shakespeare's Othello, discovering the emotion of jealousy can compel humans to kill.  Koenig informs her that the scheme will not work with Helena and Verdeschi as they are not lovers—he is Helena's lover, and (to get her down to the planet) identifies Maya to be Verdeschi's.

Zamara travels to Vega with Koenig and Maya.  She plans to manipulate the Othello scenario to its full potential.  Zarl/Iago will seduce Helena/Desdemona, and the all-consuming jealousy of her lover Koenig/Othello will inflame him to commit murder.  Watching the tender reunion between Koenig and Helena, Zarl is uncertain and questions if they could be missing something by rejecting the emotion of love.

The four Alphans pool their information and come up with a plan of action.  Maya transforms into a native bird to escape the garden unnoticed.  She can hopefully circumvent the energy barrier and inspect the master computer for any exploitable weakness.  With Verdeschi's help, Koenig will contain his anger until she shuts down the system.  The seduction begins, with the masculine android sweeping Helena away into an erotic dance.  Zarl's advances are blatant, but Helena's response is impassive; she is concerned that any resistance could be translated into an act of aggression.

The music's tempo increases, and Zarl's moves become more wild and provocative.  Helena is able to deflect his caressing hands with her own non-aggressive motions coordinated with the dance.  Koenig fumes silently under the scrutiny of the Vegans as Zarl's gentle rape progresses.  A passive Helena is lowered onto a pile of cushions by Zarl.  Emotions stirring, the Vegan plants a passionate kiss on her mouth.  In spite of herself, she is aroused.  Maya returns with grave news:  the computer has a fail-safe mechanism—interference with its power source initiates an explosion that could destroy the entire planet.  Koenig leaps into action as he sees Helena surrendering herself to Zarl's foreplay.  He pulls the android man off her and slugs him.

The Vegans are elated; they have finally witnessed an act of violence and rage.  Goaded on by Zamara, Zarl practices death-blows with his powerful android fists, smashing furniture and statuary.  As he turns his attention to Koenig, the other Alphans quickly confer.  The Vegans' weakness is their interlinked consciousness—like a string of Christmas-tree lights...if one fails, they all fail.  Helena stands between Koenig and Zarl.  She pleads for the android to take the final step in his evolution and become human.  She has witnessed his flashes of tenderness and compassion; now complete the journey and experience love.

Ignoring Zamara's shrill protests, Zarl takes Helena's outstretched hand and presses it to his lips.  The intensity of emotion is too much for him; rapture gives way to agonising torment and he crumples to the floor.  With a wail of defeat, Zamara and the other androids wind down, immobilised.  Having watched from the shrubbery, the Numbers gather and peel off their masks, rejoicing in their new-found freedom.  Zarl manages to briefly cling to existence; he declares he did feel love at the end.  Comforted by a teary-eyed Helena, he tells her it is worth oblivion to have experienced just that one moment of humanity, then expires.

Music 

An original score was composed for this episode by Derek Wadsworth.  The second movement of Beethoven's 'Symphony No. 9 in D minor' was played by Zamara in the Alpha Recreation Centre.  'Storm at Sun-Up' by Canadian jazz composer Gino Vannelli, was selected by choreographer Lionel Blair to accompany the seduction dance during filming, and served as Wadsworth's inspiration when preparing his score.  A brief moment of the 'space horror music' composed by Vic Elms and Alan Willis for ""Ring Around the Moon"" can be heard when Zarl takes Helena's hand and says, 'The play begins.'  This is the only occurrence of a first-series music-track being used this year.

Production Notes 

 The shooting script, written by former UFO script editor Tony Barwick, contains an epilogue cut for time from the final edit.  The viewer would have seen a restored Alpha dispatching a recovery Eagle, and Alan Carter arriving on Vega with cold-weather gear for Koenig and company.  With the Vegan city powered down, the Alphans discuss the future with the Numbers, who are looking forward to re-learning the basics of survival in their world's harsh environment.  Helena and Koenig then exchange banter regarding Zarl; though the android was a good-looking and masculine Iago, Helena states she much prefers her Othello.  The script's status-report date is stated as 415 days by Helena and was changed in post-production.
 After completing this episode, series regular Zienia Merton decided to leave the programme.  She was dissatisfied with her lack of a contract and diminished involvement in the second series.  Feeling the new American producer Fred Freiberger did not appreciate her contribution to the previous series and not seeing any potential change in the foreseeable future, she opted to depart. Merton would change her mind and return to the show three months later, but during her absence, her character would be replaced by Japanese operative Yasko.  Yasko was portrayed by Yasuko Nagazumi, the wife of Space: 1999 director Ray Austin.
 Coming off her critically acclaimed, award-winning performance as Mrs. Baylock in the 1976 horror film The Omen, Billie Whitelaw was cast as the sensuously diabolical android Zamara.  A veteran of British theatre, her stage-trained voice had to be modulated in post-production to prevent it from overwhelming all other elements of the soundtrack.
 Costume designer Emma Porteous recalls how she and production designer Keith Wilson closely collaborated to produce a cohesive look for the beautiful and sensual world of Vega.  The sets for this production were revamped from the Grove of Psyche, the corridors of Psychon and the caverns left over from ""The Metamorph"".  The red nylon quilted jackets introduced in ""Dragon's Domain"" were worn here by Catherine Schell and background extra Robert Reeves.
 A large quantity of publicity stills for the second series were taken during the filming of this episode.  The regular cast, alone or in combinations, were photographed in a variety of action poses involving attacking aliens.  Among these aliens were stuntmen dressed in the Vegan android costume and 'Number' costume, a Highlander from ""Journey to Where"" and stuntman Frank Maher in his Decontamination Unit coverall from ""The Exiles"", his face smeared with grey greasepaint.
 Apart from simple laser-beam overlays, teleportation energy-flares and one big-screen shot with a burn-in of the star-chart showing the before-and-after positions of the Moon, there are no substantial visual effects in this episode.  Verdeschi's POV shot of the surface of Vega and the single shot of the planet over Moonbase Alpha were library footage both taken from the first-series episode ""Death's Other Dominion"".

Novelisation 

The episode was adapted in the second Year Two Space: 1999 novel Mind-Breaks of Space by Michael Butterworth and J. Jeff Jones published in 1977.  It included the deleted epilogue scene.

History

Founding 

Killick Martin and Company was founded in 1861 under the name Killick Martin by Captain James Killick (1816–1889) and James Henry Martin. James Killick was born at the Killick family home, named Whitehall in Cheam, England, in 1816. He first went to sea in 1831, commanding his first ship in 1840. His seafaring background gave him the necessary experience to manage the ship-owning side of the business. James Henry Martin, twenty years younger than Killick, who had previously worked for Phillips, Shaw & Lowther, which later changed its name to Shaw, Lowther and Maxton (owners of famous clipper ships like Ariel and Titania) concentrated on the running of the office and securing of cargo.

In 1863, the company name was changed to Killick Martin & Company when David William Richie became a partner.

On 31 October 1953 the Killick Martin & Company partnership was dissolved and the business acquired by a private limited company formed for that purpose to be known as Killick Martin & Company Ltd. The partners became directors, and Denys Godin became chairman, holding this position until 1970.

Shipowners (1862–1886)

An important part of Killick Martin & Company's business during its first 25 years was the owning and management of sailing ships. The three partners Killick, Martin & Ritchie constituted themselves as joint owners, although James Killick also held shares in three vessels on his own account: Yang-tsze, Challenger and Miako. The partners only twice held all the shares in owned vessels and these were Gazelle and Heversham. As specialists in managing ships and finding cargo initially all the ship owning partners nominated James Henry Martin, David William Ritchie and James Killick as managing owners, but in 1875 Martin and Ritchie designated James Killick the sole managing owner.

Apart from the three partners, the next principal shareholder was Edward Boustead, who held shares in eleven of Killick Martin & Company's vessels. Boustead was the senior partner in Boustead & Company from 1851 to his death in 1888. Two of Boustead's partners in Boustead & Company, Wardrop Shaw and Jasper Young, also held shares in some of the ships. Jasper Young owned 40 shares in Mabel Young presumably named after his wife or daughter.

Other shareholders had connections with the initial Managing Owners. John Dugdale had been the owner of John Dugdale which James Killick had once commanded and George Fredrick Thomson had been the master of both the Fusi Yama and Obma. He was the only master and shareholder in the Killick Martin fleet.

Vessels

During the period May 1862 and July 1886, Killick Martin & Company held shares in twenty vessels.  The first vessel owned by the company, Gazelle, was built in 1862. She was primarily a sailing vessel with auxiliary steam power, although registered at Lloyd's as a sailing vessel. Gazelle was sold after only one year in the fleet, and, after that, the company only owned and operated clipper ships. During its ship owning period, Killick Martin & Company were represented in Hong Kong and China by Jardine Matheson.

One vessel listed within the Killick Martin & Company fleet table, 'Eastern Star' is not listed in the shareholders' table as she was only owned between 27 September and 15 October 1872. Eastern Star, would appear to have been a vessel possibly traded on behalf of another party.

Shareholders

The numbers below represent the number of shares held at the time of registration or soon after. In the case of Gazelle Ritchie had not yet joined the firm.

Notable Captains 

James Killick - Captain of Challenger 
 

James Killick was born on 26 August 1816 in Surrey. The first ship on which Killick served was The Ganges in 1833. Many of the ships he served on were not known but he is next recorded as commander of the Arun in the Canton Press in 1841. He then commanded the John Dugdale in 1845. In 1849 he obtained his Masters Certificate.

Challenger was built in 1852 by Richard & Henry Green, in their Blackwall Yard for Hugh Hamilton Lindsay, London. She was a remarkable departure from the previous ships produced. In 1850 the American clipper ship Oriental visited West India Docks, the largest clipper ship to visit London and the Admiralty was given permission to take her lines, and this was done by Messrs Waymouth and Cornish, both Lloyd's Surveyors, in the dry dock at Green's Yard in Blackwell. This is probably the reason that it was said that Challenger's design was inspired by and had a close resemblance to the Oriental's.

From The Copartnership Herald, Vol. I, no. 8 (October 1931)

...American ships, which still held the supremacy until soon after Richard Green had declared his decision not to be beaten by them. He had a new tea clipper built at his yard at Blackwall, called the Challenger, of 699 tons, and she was sent off to China, Captained by James Killick in 1852. Having loaded tea at Shanghai, she set out for London, calling in at Anjer where she met the American ship, Challenge, which was on her way to London with a cargo of tea from Canton. The Challenge was a 2,000 tonner, built expressly for speed and capacity, and was the largest clipper built by the Americans until that time. So it was that a race home was started by these two vessels, the smaller British clipper gaining London two days ahead of her huge rival. Naturally, this set the hearts of all the British owners aglow, and was instrumental in urging on the efforts of our shippers to capture the China trade.

On 8 August 1853 Captain James Killick commenced another race with Challenger against the American clipper Nightingale from Shanghai. Challenger reached Deal on 26 November, 2 days earlier than Nightingale.

Captain James Killick went on to found Killick Martin in 1863 and purchased Challenger in 1865.

John Smith - Captain of John C.Munro & Maju

John Smith was born in Anstruther, Fife, in 1823. His life at sea saw him rise from a boy on a Greenland whaler, to the position of master of the Lahloo, one of the most successful of the China tea clippers. After the loss of the Lahloo in 1872, Smith was given a position by Killick Martin & Company, first as Captain of John C. Munro in 1873 and then to oversee the building of their New vessel, Maju at Dundee. She was an iron clipper intended for the ""China Run"", and much was expected of her in the trade. She sailed from Dundee on her maiden voyage bound for Rangoon with Smith in command, but was lost with all hands five days later off Barvas in Lewis, in the ""Great Gale of 21st October, 1874"". John Smith's body was recovered and he is buried at Riccarton, Ayrshire. Eleven members of the crew are buried at Barvas, Lewis. A book has been written about his life called China Clipper Captain by John Robinson. The house John Smith was born in has a blue plaque to commemorate his life and another he had built in 1870 is also a hotel called The Spendrift both in Anstruther, East Neuk of Fife.

John Gadd- Captain of Kaisow

Captain John Gadd was born in 1825. He took command of Kaisow at 50 years of age in 1875 and stayed with the ship until she was sold in 1885.

In 1883 Kaisow was passing Krakatoa at the time of its eruption. Second mate on Kaisow was Harry Davis, who went on to be a Captain himself, wrote a very graphic account of the experience. He described how Captain John Gadd sailed the ship down the Sunda Straits, braced sharp up, how the ship weathered the erupting island and so got into the open water and felt the tail end of the huge Tidal wave which tore north up the Sunda Straits.

Both sides of the Sunda straights were hit taking out 165 villages. The town of Anjur was completely wiped out, killing approximately 36,000 people. Some estimates for fatalities are as high as 120,000.

The eruption of Krakatoa created the world's loudest sound recorded in human history and could be heard 3,000 miles away. Anyone within 40 miles would have had their eardrums ruptured. Tsunamis caused by Krakatoa reached 98 feet high. The Sumatran coastline was devastated by waves and erosion caused by the blasts. A pressure wave from the third explosion traveled over 670 miles out from the island.

James Lowe - Captain of Agnes Muir

James Lowe was the son of Robert Lowe, another Captain in the Killick Martin & Company fleet. Robert Lowe had been Captain of Osaka for 11 years. James Lowe served in sixteen different ships from 1864 to 1918 and was an apprentice on the ‘Taeping’ during the Great Tea Race in 1866. He served as first mate on Killick Martin & Company’s The Sir Jamsetjee Family before being appointed Captain of the Agnes Muir when he was 27 years old. He remained a Captain for Killick Martin & Company until the Agnes Muir was sold in 1869. Later in his career during the First World War James Lowe was Captain of ‘Petroleline’ which in 1918 was shelled by a German submarine whilst crossing the Atlantic. The Petroleline returned fire and escaped the encounter. James Lowe was awarded the Lloyd's silver medal and an O.B.E.

House flag (1868) 

Killick Martin & Company initially used a house flag or maritime flag to identify the company's vessels with two blue stripes and a wider white center stripe. From 1868, the design was changed by adding a vertical blue bar to form an ""H"".

Harry James, a former Captain employed by Killick Martin said that he had suggested to Captain Killick that in his opinion the original flag was too similar in design to a signal flag, so Captain Killick himself requested the addition of a blue bar.

The flag became known as ""Killick's H"" or the ""Hungry H"". The exact date of the change is unknown but a sail plan of Obma, a clipper owned by Killick Martin & Company showed the new flag in February 1868. An example of a Killick Martin house flag is held at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, and one was flown above Trinity House on 15 March 1961 to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary.

Ship broking (1861–1999) 

The first advertised ship of Killick Martin & Company was the Tung Yu, which appeared in The Times on 30 May 1861. In their first advertisements they appear as loading brokers alongside Robertson & Company, these two firms along with Shaw Lowther & Maxton were the leading shipbroking firms of the 1860s and 1870s. Shipbroking and chartering activities continued for the next 100 years. In 1975, Killick Martin & Company Ltd ceased active trading on the Baltic Exchange. In 1985, Killick Martin & Company Ltd acquired Wallace Shipping Chartering Ltd an existing Baltic Exchange broking firm which was then renamed Killick Martin Chartering Ltd. The firm was subsequently sold to Howe Robinson Group.

The tea trade (1865–1879) 

Killick Martin & Company's founder and senior partner James Killick was an experienced sea captain, completing numerous voyages with tea from China, including his record-breaking passage in 1852 with Challenger. After forming Killick Martin & Company it is not surprising that James Killick's primary focus was on the tea trade.

1864 was the first year in which a passage was made by a sailing ship owned by Killick Martin. The ship's name was Heversham, and she carried a cargo of tea from Shanghai to New York. In 1865 the company purchased James Killick's former ship Challenger and took delivery of their first new build Fusi Yama. With the expanding fleet, Killick Martin entered the tea trade to London in 1866. This was the year of the Great Tea Race when Killick Martin's vessels Challenger, Fusi Yama, and Yang-tsze were among the 57 vessels completing voyages. As the Killick Martin fleet multiplied thereafter the company regularly had three or four ships loading tea each season.

Killick Martin also sailed with tea from China and Japan to the American cities of New York and Boston.

By the 1878–79 season, however, steamers had started to take over from sailing vessels on the tea trade to London due to improvements in their reliability, speed, and the opening of the Suez Cannel. The Far East Freight Conference (FEFC)  which came into existence in 1879 may also have been a factor. Two Killick Martin vessels completed journeys during this last 'tea' season, Yang-tsze from Foochow and Wylo from Shanghai, both to London.

In total Killick Martin's ships are recorded as having completed 36 passages between 1866 and 1879 with tea cargoes from Foochow, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankow and Yokohama, to London.

As well as operating their own vessels between China, Japan and London during this period, Killick Martin were also brokers for many others. In Lloyd's List of 18 November 1869, Killick Martin are listed as being brokers for the vessels Eleanor, Kawagawa and Yokohama, Taeping, Helen Nicholson, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere.

Trade routes (1878–1886) 
1878 was the last year Killick Martin & Company took part in the Tea Trade to London and thereafter the general pattern of trade shows that outward cargoes were frequently carried to China and Japan, but were often loaded in Europe or America. Manila in the Philippines became a preferred loading port for homewards, whilst from the 1880s Java in Indonesia and US West Coast offered more opportunities for cargoes. A considerable volume of cargoes were taken from Hong Kong to Hamburg and Le Havre.

Improving telegraphy during this period allowed instructions from Killick Martin & Company's head office in London to be sent to the ships directing them to cargoes and so changing some of the traditional patterns of trade.

Here is a brief summary of trade routes some of the Killick Martin & Company fleet operated within:

Agnes Muir & Lucia traded principally East and Westbound between Europe to Hong Kong.

Lothair & Obma, East and Westbound between Europe and Japan, but also Java, Manila and America.

Kaisow & Wylo Eastbound to various Chinese ports and Southbound to Australia, and in later years both loaded for San Francisco on their return voyages.

Elmstone, John C. Munro and Osaka seem to have had no specific pattern calling at ports both sides of the Pacific.

Hope & Miako, visited many ports within the Islands of the Eastern Archipelago.

The Sir Jamsetjee Family operated mostly East and Westbound between Europe and the Philippines.

Boxer protocol (1901) 

The Boxer Protocol was signed on 7 September 1901, between the Qing Empire of China and the Eight-Nation Alliance that had provided military forces (including Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom) as well as Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands; after China's defeat in the intervention to put down the Boxer Rebellion.

On 3 March 1925, Great Britain completed negotiations to allow China to use its share of the United Kingdom's Boxer Indemnity which totalled GBP 7,537,500 in 1901, to purchase railway infrastructure and in China.

Killick Martin & Company was selected as agents by the Chinese Government Purchasing Commission, set up in London under Dr. Ching-Chun Wang, Commissioner and Director of the Chinese government Purchasing Commission in 1931 to handle the shipments to China.

Some of the money was used to fund the construction of the Canton, modern day Guanzhou to -Hankow modern day Hankou Railway.

Bombing of Fen Court Offices (1941) 
Killick Martin & Company moved from George Yard in Lombard Street to 7 Fen Court in September 1886. They purchased the freehold of the building just after the end of the First World War. Some use was also made of 5 Fen Court for storage.

During the blitz on the night of 10/11 May 1941 heavy bombing by the Luftwaffe destroyed the offices of Killick Martin at 7 Fen Court. The contents of the building were entirely destroyed by fire and water. All the firms early records were lost including, alas, a builders model of Challenger. Fortunately, with the help of Brahmapootra Tea Company, a small refuge office had been set up in advance at No. 9 Bishopsgate for just such an emergency and on Monday, 12 May the firm moved into this building where they remained for 2 years. At the end of this time, they moved to Fenton House in Fenchurch Street which coincidentally, was the building in which Elder Dempster had their offices until 1933.

Liner agencies (1864–1999) 
William Thompson & Company / Ben Line

1864–1914

William Thomson & Company first engaged Killick Martin & Company to act as their agents in 1864 for the vessel Alexander. In 1869 for the vessel Ocean Chief in 1869, and then on four occasions for the vessel Araby Maid between 1870 and 1871.

A gap of ten years took place before they acted again in 1872 and 1873 as agents for Benledi. By 1881 William Thompson's ships were known as Ben Line and had started using the prefix ‘Ben’ within their names. Killick Martin & Company were appointed as agents for all Ben Line vessels in 1883, and within a few weeks loaded their first ship Benarty in Antwerp.  The timing for their appointment as agents was ideal in that it assisted with the transition of Killick Martin's business from ship owing to becoming liner agents.

1914–1950The First and Second World Wars were challenging times for Killick Martin & Company and  Ben Line. In 1914 Ben Line had 21 ships, 14 of which were steamers and at the end of the war had lost 10. At the beginning of The a Second World War Ben Line's fleet had risen to 20 ships, but by 1945 only 6 remained.

During The Second World War all British ships were requisitioned, but as far as possible the individual liner companies were allowed to continue loading their own ships in their own trades.

Killick Martin & Company's offices in 7 Fen Court, were destroyed by bombing in May 1941.

1950–1970

Between 1950 and 1972, Ben Line continued to develop its liner services between Europe and the Far East, with Killick Martin & Company as its UK Agents operating fast, custom built tween deck vessels. Ben Line pioneered a number of new trade routes, and became one of the leading liner companies in the trade. 
1970-1992Containerised services began in the Far East trade towards the end of 1971. Ben Line and Ellerman Lines together formed Ben Line Containers (BLC), with Ben Line owning 80% of the shareholding in March 1970 and appointed Killick Martin & Company Ltd as its agents. With these developments Killick Martin & Company found itself at the centre of the shipping industry's transition into containerisation of the Far East trade.

Three BLC container ships were constructed, Benalder VI (1972), Benavon IV (1973) and The City of Edinburgh (1973) each with a displacement of 75,000 tons and 3,000 TEU. During a years operation each of these vessels could do the work of 7 conventional vessels.

These ships operated within the 17 strong fleet of a three-nation consortium (the Trio Group) made up of Ben Line, Hapag-Lloyd, Mitsui-OSK (MOL),  Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) and Overseas Containers Ltd (OCL) all engaged in the Far East trade. Although the operation of the ships were integrated within Trio (the name coming from the companies owning the vessels originating in three countries, Great Britain, Germany and Japan) each company marketed its services separately, and BLC did this via Killick Martin & Company.

Trio's UK service called at Southampton and Killick Martin & Company's Southampton office managed all BLC ships. Offices were also opened within Barking, Birmingham and Leeds container bases. This expansion together with the general growth in other trade lanes with the move into containerisation saw Killick Martin & Company's employee number grow to an altimeter high of 530 in 1974.

BLC's ships served an expanding number of ports across the Far East throughout the 1970s. The ships were converted from steam turbine to diesel between 1980 and 1981. At this point container capacity was also increased on all three vessels. In the face of increasing competition on the Far East route, these three vessels were deemed in need of replacement by 1992, at which point the cost of doing so was too great and so they were sold to the East Asiatic Company (EAC) of Denmark in 1992, and Killick Martin & Company Ltd's agency terminated with the subsequent sale of EAC to A. P. Moller / Maersk Line in 1993.

Alfred Holt & Company / Blue Funnel LineIn 1920 Alfred Holt & Company's ‘Blue Funnel Line’ started a service  with Ellerman Lines & Bucknall known as the Far East Line and appointed Killick Martin & Company as their agents for this service as well as for Ben Line as each service offered alternative UK ports.

In 1935  Blue Funnel Line purchased Glen Line, a direct competitor to Ben Line in the Far East Europe trade lane. Despite this acquisition creating potential conflicts for Killick Martin & Company no changes were made by any party at this time.

The Far East trade stopped in 1942 with the Japanese capture of Singapore. During the war Blue Funnel Line lost 30 vessels. After the war all parties agreed it was difficult for Killick Martin & Company to continue to represent both Ben Line and Blue Funnel Line so a mutual decision was made between all parties that Killick Martin & Company should sadly terminate the Blue Funnel Line agency. Killick Martin & Company would continue to represent William Thompson & Company's Ben Line.

Elder Dempster LinesMV Aureol was a passenger/cargo ship, along with her sister ships, MV Apapa and MV Accra and the last flag ship of the Elder Dempster Lines fleet. Together with her sister ships, she operated services to Ghana and Nigeria. She was sold in 1974. In 1933 Sir Richard Holt, Chairman of Elder Dempster Lines wrote to Killick Martin & Company informing them of their London offices were to close and invited Killick Martin & Company to represent them. Sir Richard Holt, senior partner in Alfred Holt & Company has been asked to undertake the reconstruction of Elder Dempster Line after it went into administration by their administrator. Sir Richard Holt's relationship with Killick Martin & Company dated back to the period when they were agents for Alfred Holt & Company. 15 employees from Elder Dempster Lines London offices were transferred to Killick Martin & Company.
MV Aureol was a passenger/cargo ship, along with her sister ships, MV Apapa and MV Accra and the last flag ship of the Elder Dempster Lines fleet. Together with her sister ships, she operated services to Ghana and Nigeria. She was sold in 1974.

In 1951 Elder Dempster Lines took over the British & Burmese Steam Navigation Company and in 1957 took a 33% stake in Nigerian National Shipping Line, although sold this to the Nigerian government in 1961.

In 1965 Elder Dempster Lines cam under the ownership of Ocean Steamship Company (Blue Funnel Line) and in 1970 acquired Shaw, Savill & Albion Line.

In 1983 Killick Martin & Company celebrated the 50th anniversary of its partnership with Elder Dempster Lines.

The end for the Elder Dempster Lines name came to in 1989 when it was bought by the French firm Delmas. Delmas was in turn brought by CMA-CGM in 2005 and fully integrated into CMA-CGM in 2016 when the name was dropped.

Geest Line
Geest Line appointed Killick Martin & Company Ltd in 1964 to find return cargo to destinations in the West Indies. Until 1964 the ships sailed to the U.K. with Bananas, but had returned empty. The U.K. port was Liverpool, but was switched to Preston and then Barry in South Wales.

Lykes Line
In 1966 Lykes Line of New Orleans appointed Killick Martin & Company Ltd as their U.K. agents.

Lykes Line did have a London office, but this was closed and an owners representative office was established in Killick Martin & Company's offices and some employees were also transferred.

Between 1970 and 1972 Lykes Line acquired three new ‘seabee’ vessels. These vessels also known as Type C8-class ships were called the SS Doctor Lykes, now Cape Mendeco), SS Almeria Lykes, now SS Cape May, and SS Tillie Lykes, now SS Cape Mohican and could carry both containers and floating barges. They served the United States Gulf ports and Northern Europe. In the U.K. until 1985 they served the London berth in the River Thames at Gravesend Pier but after that the service was switched to the Port of Felixstowe.

In 1986 the three ‘Seabee’ ships were transferred to the US Navy's Military Sealift Command. They were used in Desert Storm and Desert Shield operations.

These ships were replaced with the Tyson and Tillie Lykes, 2,000 TEU container vessels built in 1985.

Until 1994 Lykes Line was the nominated North Atlantic carrier for all US Military cargo.

In February 1997 Lykes Line filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy and was acquired by CP Ships at which point the agency agreement with which was acquired by a Hapag Lloyd in 2006.

United Arab Shipping Company
In 1972 Kuwait Shipping Company (KSC) appointed Killick Martin & Company Ltd as its agents. Four years later KSC merged into the United Arab Shipping Company (UASC). A joint company formed by the governments of Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Qatar. UASC also appointed Killick Martin & Company Ltd as its agents. By the mid 1980s Killick Martin & Company Ltd's business for the Middle East grew substantially and the volumes handled were second only to those in the Far East trade for Ben Line.

In 1985 Killick Martin & Company Ltd acquired a majority share holding in Wallace Shipping Chartering Ltd which was renames Killick Martin Chartering Ltd and a 50% holding in United Arab Chartering Ltd. The other shareholder in both these companies being Kuwait Shipping Agencies Ltd.

Killick Martin & Company remained UASC's agent until 1999.

UASC was merged into Hapag Lloyd in 2017. The deal gave a relative valuation of the two businesses at 72 percent for Hapag-Lloyd and 28 percent for UASC. At the time of the merger, UASC was 51 percent owned by Qatar and 35 percent owned by Saudi Arabia government, with the remainder held by other Arab states.

Atlantis Air (1947) 

On 21 April 1947 Atlantis Air Ltd was formed by Killick Martin & Company together with Elder Dempster (Canary Islands) and appointed Skyways to commence a thrice weekly service from June that year between Northolt and Gando Grand Canaria via Lisbon using Avro York aircraft.

Elder Dempster (Canary Islands) later sold their investment to William Thompson & Company.

Atlantis Air Ltd also operated a De Havilland Dove G-ANPH purchased for £24,000 between 1954 and 1966 from London Airport (Croydon) to Amsterdam for charter. One of its most famous charters was in 1957 to take Sir Winston Churchill Field Marshall Lord Bernard Montgomery and Sir Edward Heath, an MP at the time, to Newmarket Racecourse.

In the mid-1960s Atlantic Air had an office in Building 88 at Heathrow Airport which assisted its sister company Killick Martin & Company Ltd when it was asked by Cathay Pacific to take responsibility for its first-ever cargo flight into Gatwick Airport.

Killick Vogt (1980–1993) 
Killick Martin & Company Ltd formed a joint venture with Vogt & Maguire Ltd in 1980.

Vogt & Maguire Ltd where established shipping agents in London and Liverpool, incorporated in 1953 like Killick Martin & Company, but with a history stretching back over 100 years.

Killick Vogt Ltd set up sub-office arrangements in various ports so that the shipping line agency business of both parent companies could be handled throughout the country.

In November 1986 Killick Martin & Company Ltd acquired the other 50% shareholding from Vogt & Maguire Ltd and in its financial statement as of 31 October 1987 the company was dormant. In December of that year, its name was changed to Killick Martin Services Ltd. The company was dormant under this name between 1987 and 1990.

In May 1990 the companies name was changed from Killick Martin Services Ltd to Dolphin International Freight Services Ltd and was sold in April 1993.

Freight forwarding (1921–present) 
Killick Martin & Company commenced freight forwarding services in 1921. The company at the time was organised into three areas of activity. The liner agency for Ben Line, the liner agency for Holt/Blue Funnel Line and a freight forwarding division.

Unfortunately little is known of its early freight forwarding activities as all records were lost in the bombing of 7 Feb Court in 1941.

Killick Martin & Company continued to offer freight forwarding services after World War II, but it was the rapid development of its liner agency business that became its key focus.

To address this and offset its declining liner agency business in the early 1990s, Killick Martin & Company Ltd was restructured in 1996 into four separate operating companies, and one of these, KM International Ltd took control of all freight forwarding activities.

The other divisions were Eastgate Transport Ltd, United Arab Agencies Ltd and Killick Martin Chartering Ltd, which was 51% owned.

When Killick Martin & Company Ltd was on the verge of administration in June 1999, a director of KM International Ltd acquired with another partner the business from the then appointed administrators, (which incidentally was originally the company registered as Atlantis Air Ltd in 1947), and changed the name from KM International Ltd to Killick Martin & Company Ltd.

Killick Martin & Company was first offered for sale to Atlantic Pacific Group Ltd in 2014.

The former director who acquired the business from the administrators in 1999 transferred in 2015 with a number of employees to Atlantic Pacific Global Logistics Ltd and operated Killick Martin as a division. Atlantic Pacific Group Ltd decided to separate these activities back into a separate company in July 2017 to focus on supply chain management and freight forwarding services.

Awards 
Killick Martin & Company Ltd were finalists in the British International Freight Awards (BIFA) in the Supply Chain Management, Ocean Services and Cool Chain Award Categories 2020 and were the winners of the 2021 European Logistics Award by BIFA for 2021.

32,149,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type8,"Scorched is a 2003 American crime comedy film directed by Gavin Grazer, starring Alicia Silverstone, Rachael Leigh Cook, Woody Harrelson and John Cleese. Scorched follows the story of several disgruntled bank employees who all try to rob the same bank on the same night without knowing that others are doing exactly the same thing.

The film had a poor financial performance at the box office. From the initial budget of US $7 million, Scorched earned back $8,000 at the end of its theatrical run. It was pulled from its theatrical run after a sole weekend in the theaters where it managed to earn $666 per theater.

Plot
Sheila Rilo is a bank teller at Desert Savings Bank in a small desert town. Her boyfriend is Rick Becker, the bank manager who was informed by his superiors that he would be fired if the bank's ATMs were to be robbed just one more time. Sheila and Rick have spent several years in an on-again off-again relationship, in which he uses her between other flings. After Sheila pays for most of Rick's education, he leaves her for his tutor. Sheila decides to exact revenge on Rick by robbing the bank and getting him fired.

On the same night, Stuart and Jason, two other tellers from the same bank, have also decided to rob the bank. Stuart's plan is to steal $250,000 from the bank and bet the entire amount on one game of roulette in Las Vegas. Stuart, who is desperate for excitement in his life, is following the suggestion of his friend Max, even though the intelligent Stuart usually talks Max out of his hare-brained get-rich-quick schemes.

Jason is a nature lover who lives with an orphaned duck. He was promoted to assistant bank manager, a position with much more responsibility but only a $0.55 per hour raise. He feels the bank owes him for years of loyal and underpaid service and he decides to get even by robbing the safety deposit box of a mean-spirited local millionaire, Charles Merchant. Merchant, who got rich from making infomercials and selling videotapes on how to get rich quickly on the real estate market, is the person that shot Jason's duck's mother, therefore making easier Jason's decision to rob Merchant's safety deposit box.

Jason is not the only one with a plan for revenge against the local tycoon. A disgruntled clothing store employee, Shmally, takes her revenge against Merchant the same night by having her friend/roommate Carter help her throw eggs at Merchant's home. Carter, with the help of Shmally, is in the process of cleaning himself up for a job interview at Desert Savings Bank. He is hired and arrives at the bank on Monday morning for his first day, only to be turned away by Rick.

Ultimately, all three bank employees are successful in their individual robberies, with each being completely unaware of the other's plans. After Rick is informed of his firing, he approaches each of them to offer them the job as bank manager. One by one they quit, leaving Rick to offer employment to Carter as he leaves the bank.

In an epilogue, we learn that Carter worked his way up to the assistant manager position at the bank, Max and Stu moved to Las Vegas, Jason traveled south and was never seen again, and Sheila enrolled at UCLA.

Reception

Critical response
The film received generally negative reviews from film critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score 17% based on reviews from 6 critics.

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film one star out of five and called Scorched ""a bigger and more disagreeable waste of time than rolling an enormous ball of solid ordure up a steep hill"" while Angus Wolfe Murray of Eye for Film, who awarded the film the same 1 star-rating, called it an ""unmitigated disaster"" and concluded that ""a car wreck has more style"". Rich Cline of ShadowsontheWall.com admits that Scorched has a ""superb cast"" who are ""gifted performers"" but that the film is still a ""leaden mess"", that it's ""completely pointless"" and concludes that ""while the film is watchable, not a single plot thread comes to life"". Critic Matthew Leyland of online service BBCi gave the film two stars out of five, calling it a ""tepid revenge farce"" with an ""undercooked plot"" and observing that ""attempts at zany humour turn pear-shaped"". Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the film ""amusing but tepid"", called the script ""lazy"" and ultimately concluded that, with only ""vaguely likable characters"", Scorched is ""aggressively amiable and utterly unmemorable"".

Of the rare favourable reviews was the one by Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter in which he called the storyline a ""raucously satisfying triumph of good over evil"" and ""a truckload of laughs"" while concluding that ""this wonderfully wayward comedy should make off with a ton of dollars, euros and other comic currency"".

Box office
Scorched was filmed in six weeks, ending principal photography on June 23, 2001 but was not released in the United States until July 25, 2003. The film suffered major financial losses during its theatrical run, earning only $8,000 (approximately 0.1%) from a production budget of $7 million. Domestically, the film was only in release for three days starting on August 3, 2003 and it played in only twelve theaters averaging gross earnings of $666 per theater. The earnings for the opening weekend, which turned out to be the film's last weekend as well, ranked the film as the 380th film of 2003 by domestic gross earnings.

Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)Noon Sunday is a 1970 action film directed by Terry Bourke about two mercenaries. The film was the first feature produced in Guam.

Production
Terry Bourke and producer Gordon Mailloux had previously worked on the film Sampan together, which had been a success. They decided to make a second film in Guam, in part to establish local facilities which could be used by Japanese film crews who often used the island to shoot commercials and films. Money was raised from local investors and the Guam Economic Development Authority and Crown International agreed to distribute.

Shooting took two to three months using a combination of local actors and Hollywood talent. Scenes were shot aboard the USS Razorback. with interior scenes shot in Hong Kong and special effects scenes shot in Japan.

Reception
The film was screened all around the world, making $25,000 in Guam, but according to Mailloux, Crown International took all the money.

66,150,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type7,"Grey Gardens is a musical with book by Doug Wright, music by Scott Frankel, and lyrics by Michael Korie, produced in 2006 and based on the 1975 documentary of the same title about the lives of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (""Big Edie"") and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (""Little Edie"") by Albert and David Maysles. The Beales were Jacqueline Kennedy's aunt and cousin, respectively.  Set at Grey Gardens, the Bouviers' mansion in East Hampton, New York, the musical tracks the progression of the two women's lives from their original status as rich and socially polished aristocrats to their eventual largely isolated existence in a home overrun by cats and cited for repeated health code violations. However, its more central purpose is to untangle the complicated dynamics of their dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship.

Storyline 
The first act depicts the characters in their heyday and is a speculative take on what their lives might have been like when they were younger, when Little Edie was 24 and Big Edie 47. The second act is set 32 years later in 1973 at the decaying Grey Gardens estate and hews closely to the Maysles Brothers' documentary in its portrayal of them in their later years, when Little Edie is 56 and Big Edie is 79.  While the first act is almost entirely fictional (the central event, the engagement between Little Edie and Joseph Kennedy, never happened), the second act takes much of its dialogue and action directly from the film. The same actress who plays Big Edie in the first act plays Little Edie in the second act.

Productions
The musical opened Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on February 10, 2006 and ran through April 30, 2006. Directed by Michael Greif with choreography by Jeff Calhoun, it starred Christine Ebersole, Mary Louise Wilson, and John McMartin.  It received mixed reviews, but attracted particularly good reviews for Ebersole and Wilson. It earned five Lucille Lortel Award nominations and twelve Drama Desk Award nominations.

Christine Ebersole received the Obie Award, Drama Desk Award, Outer Critics Circle Award, a Special Citation from the New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the Drama League Award for Performance of the Year (2006) for her dual roles of Edith and Edie Beale in the Off-Broadway production.

The show opened, with revisions, on Broadway on November 2, 2006 at the Walter Kerr Theatre and closed on July 29, 2007, after 307 performances and 33 previews. The production was nominated for 10 Tony Awards in 2007, winning three, including awards for both Ebersole and Wilson in leading and featured actress categories, respectively.

According to an article in Playbill on November 21, 2007, composer Scott Frankel said there were no plans for a national tour based on the 2006-07 Broadway production, but ""Dramatists Play Service, Inc. is handling the show's licensing to stock, amateur, university and resident theatres. Independent productions, which started playing in those markets in 2008.""

Reception
The Broadway production was received enthusiastically by critics. Time Magazine named Grey Gardens the No. 1 best show to come out in 2006.  In reviewing the Off-Broadway production, Ben Brantley, reviewing for The New York Times, wrote ""A blend of gentle compassion and acute observation, Ms. Ebersole's performance is one of the most gorgeous ever to grace a musical."" However, he also noted that the musical ""tilts perilously toward cheap celebrity camp."" with a ""very long and finally tedious first act."" Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the musical ""brings to mind two phrases seldom linked nowadays: 'Broadway musical' and 'artistic integrity'... the songs, with music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie, sustain a level of refined language and psychological detail as elevated as Stephen Sondheim's. The score is a meticulously fashioned piece of musical theater that gains in depth the more you listen to it.""

The Original Broadway Cast album was released on March 27, 2007 through PS Classics. It was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.

Tony Award-winning musicalsThe Universities Research Association is a non-profit association of more than 90 research universities, primarily but not exclusively in the United States. It was founded in 1965 at the behest of the President's Science Advisory Committee and the National Academy of Sciences to build and operate Fermilab, a  National Accelerator Laboratory. Today, the mission of URA is ""[t]o establish and operate in the national interest unique laboratories and facilities for research, development, and education in the physical and biological sciences to expand the frontiers of knowledge, foster innovation, and promote the education of future generations of scientists.""

History
In 1962, the President's Science Advisory Committee and a sister committee under the United States Atomic Energy Commission joined to ""assess the future needs in high-energy accelerator physics."" The recommendations from this panel, set out in 1963, included the need to immediately begin construction and design on a series of cutting-edge, high-energy proton accelerators to ensure that the U.S. stayed at the forefront of this emerging set of technologies and the science they enabled.  An additional recommendation called for a new administrative construct to ensure robust participation of experts from a broad swath of the Nation’s universities.  In early 1965 the National Academy of Sciences addressed this last recommendation by sponsoring a meeting of presidents from twenty-five major research universities to discuss the management of the accelerator facility that would later become the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory or Fermilab. The meeting eventually resulted in the decision to form the Universities Research Association, with 34 original members, to build and manage the new accelerator facility. URA filed its articles of incorporation on June 21, 1965. J. C. Warner, president of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, served as URA’s first president. 

URA has been involved in complex scientific endeavors, including the development of the Tevatron at Fermilab, early activities related to the Super-Conducting Supercollider, Pierre Auger Cosmic Observatory, the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and the associated Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and involvement in the Honeywell International-led National Technology and Engineering Solutions at Sandia (NTESS) that manages and operates Sandia National Laboratories. Current major projects of the association include supporting Fermilab through a partnership with the University of Chicago and coordinating U.S. support of the Pierre Auger Cosmic Observatory.

Zawisza Bydgoszcz athletesPeire d'Alvernhe or d'Alvernha (Pèire in modern Occitan; b. c. 1130) was an Auvergnat troubadour (active 1149–1170) with twenty-one or twenty-four surviving works. He composed in an ""esoteric"" and ""formally complex"" style known as the trobar clus. He stands out as the earliest troubadour mentioned by name in Dante's Divine Comedy.

Life
According to his vida, Peire was a burgher's son from the Diocese of Clermont. As testified to by his vida, his popularity was great within his lifetime and afterwards. Said to be handsome, charming, wise, and learned, he was ""the first good inventor of poetry to go beyond the mountains"" (i.e. the Pyrenees) and travel in Spain. He passed his time in Spain at the court of Alfonso VII of Castile and that of his son Sancho III in 1157–1158. It is possible that he was present at a meeting between Sancho of Castile, Sancho VI of Navarre and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona in 1158. The author of his vida, editorialising, considers his poems to have been the greatest until Giraut de Borneill and his melodies to have been the best ever. The anonymous biographer records that his information about Peire's later years comes from Dalfi d'Alvernha. It has been suggested that Dalfi was the author of the vida.

According to an accusation of fellow troubadour Bernart Marti, Peire entered upon a religious life early, but quit Holy Orders for a life of itinerant minstrelsy. He may be the same person as the Petrus d'Alvengue and Petrus de Alvernia who appear in surviving documents from Montpellier dated to the year 1148. Peire appears to have cultivated the favour of the ruling family of the Crown of Aragon, and his poems contain allusions to the counts of Barcelona and Provence. Perhaps he was following the fashion of the lords of Montpellier of his time, who, though vassals of the Count of Toulouse, were partial to the Aragonese. At the same time Peire did garner the support of Raymond V of Toulouse. In his wanderings he may have spent some time at Cortezon, at the court of the minor nobleman and troubadour Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Peire lived a long into old age, and performed penance before dying.

Poetry
Peire wrote mostly cansos, which, as his vida points out, were called vers in his day. He also invented the ""pious song"" and wrote six such poems dealing with serious themes of religion, piety, and spirituality. Even in his more profane works, however, one can detect the moralising influence of Marcabru, with whom in whose old age he was possibly acquainted. One of Marcabru's late songs is a satire of an early one by Peire d'Alvernhe. Marcabru's complexity was also imparted to Peire.

On the topic of courtly love, Peire, who had abandoned the religious life early, came to abandon the claims of fin'amor (""fine love"") later. When Peire espouses love of the Holy Ghost over cortez' amors de bon aire (""well-spirited courtly love"") he is the only troubadour to ever use the term ""courtly love"". Marcabrunian influence can be seen here too. In a later Crusade song, Peire defended Marcabru's abandonment of the carnal amar. He advocates gran sabers ni purs (""great and pure wisdom"") through bon'amor (""good love""). Along with Bernart Marti, Bernart de Venzac, and Gavaudan, Peire was part of a ""Marcabrunian school"". Nonetheless, as mentioned above, Bernart Marti attacked Peire for claiming superior spiritual status:
E quan canorgues si mes
Pey d'Alvernh'en canongia,
a Dieu per que.s prometia
entiers que peuys si fraysses?
Quar si feys, fols joglars es
per que l'entiers pretz cambia.
Peire's aesthetic philosophy esteemed the ""whole song"" (vers entiers), which is what he termed his completed pieces, denigrating all others' works as incomplete and imperfect. Nonetheless, from Marcabru Peire picked up a notion of the trobar braus as a legitimate format for ""rough"" themes.

One anonymous song of the Fifth Crusade, Lo Senhre que formet lo tro, written between Spring 1213 and July 1214 has been attributed to Peire d'Alvernhe, but the dating makes that impossible. In a tenso between a Bernart (probably Bernart de Ventadorn) and an unnamed Peire, perhaps Peire d'Alvernhe, the latter argues that ""it is not becoming for ladies to make love-pleas; it is fitting that men plead with them and beg their mercy.""

By far, however, Peire's most famous work is Chantarai d'aquest trobadors, a sirventes written at Puivert (Puoich-vert) in which he ridicules twelve contemporary troubadours (""a poetical gallery"") and praises himself. It has been conjectured that this piece was first performed in the presence of all twelve of the ridiculed poets in late Summer 1170 while an embassy bringing Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England, to her Spanish groom Alfonso VIII of Castile sojourned at Puivert. If the above date is not accepted, it can be probably dated later than 1165—since Giraut de Borneill was only active from c.1170—and certainly before 1173, when Raimbaut d'Aurenga died. The Monge de Montaudon later composed a parody of Peire's satire, Pos Peire d'Alvernhl a chantat.

Chantarai d'aquest trobadors is near universally regarded today as playful parody and not as a work of serious literary or artistic criticism. The obscurity of most of the ridiculed poets and the attack upon such personal characteristics as appearance and manners has been cited in support of the view that the parody was done in the presence of all twelve victims, further supporting the conclusion that the parody was good-natured. Besides the criticism of a personal nature, many of the criticism launched by Peire allude to the works of the others, notably those of Bernart de Ventadorn and Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Music
Peire's vida acclaimed him an accomplished singer and the greatest composer of melodies for verses yet known. Peire's famous Chantarai d'aquest trobadors contains a final tornada indicating its musical nature, though its own melody has not survived:

Only two of Peire's melodies still exist: one of Dejosta.ls breus jorns e.ls lonc sers, a canso, and another of his tenso. Modern notations of both are provided in Aubrey, The Music of the Troubadours.

On the whole, Peire's music is more melismatic than that typical of the troubadours and it mimics the trobar clus style of his lyrics.

November 1: The Missouri-Illinois Railroad is merged into parent Missouri Pacific Railroad.
December 31: The ICC raises the minimum operating revenue from $10 million to $50 million effective January 1, 1978, dropping seventeen railroads to Class II:
Bangor and Aroostook Railroad
Canadian Pacific Lines in Maine
Central Vermont Railway (Canadian National Railway subsidiary)
Chicago and Illinois Midland Railway
Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad
Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway (Canadian National Railway subsidiary)
Georgia Railroad (Seaboard Coast Line Railroad subsidiary)

For the 1983–84 season the Pakistan Cricket Board accorded the BCCP Patron's Trophy status for the first time in several seasons, and Hazara was one of several new teams to play at first-class level. Over the next three seasons the team played nine matches in the competition, winning two, losing six and drawing one, with one other scheduled match not taking place. 

Hazara began with a victory over another newly-promoted team, Dera Ismail Khan, by an innings and 78 runs. It was the first-class debut match of every player on both sides. The captain, Rafat Nawaz, took 3 for 13 and 6 for 32. It was his only first-class match.

Over the three seasons, Hazara lost their three matches against Rawalpindi and their three against Peshawar by large margins (five times by an innings, and once by 10 wickets). They won their 1984-85 match against Dera Ismail Khan by 17 runs, and rain ensured a draw between the same two teams in 1985-86, which was the last first-class match for both of them. 

In 1986 the authorities again rearranged the structure of first-class cricket in Pakistan and Hazara (along with Dera Ismail Khan) dropped out. They continue to play at sub-first-class levels.

Hazara did not play any home games.

Leading players

The highest score for Hazara was 97 not out by Nasim Fazal out of a team total of 217 against Peshawar in 1983-84. The best innings bowling figures were 6 for 28 by Imran Khaliq against Dera Ismail Khan in 1984-85. The best match bowling figures were 9 for 45 by Rafat Nawaz (as above). Overall Arshad Khattak scored most runs, 195 at an average of 15.00, and played most matches, seven. He also kept wicket in four matches. There were four captains.

HazaraThe Old Holy Trinity Church is a redundant Anglican church in the village of Wentworth, South Yorkshire, England.  It is partly in ruins, and stands close to a newer church also dedicated to the Holy Trinity.  The old church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

History

The tower dates from the 14th–15th century, while the rest of the church was rebuilt in 1684 for William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford.  A new church, designed by J. L. Pearson was built nearby in 1872–76.  The nave of the old church was dismantled in the later part of the 19th century.  In 1925 the chancel and a chapel were restored for William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 7th Earl Fitzwilliam.  Further renovation was carried out in 1985.  Holy Trinity was declared redundant on 12 February 1975, and was vested in the trust on 2 July 1976.

Architecture

The tower is constructed in ashlar sandstone and the rest of the church in rubble sandstone.  The roofs of the chancel and chapel are in stone slate.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a partly ruined five-bay nave, and a chancel with a north chapel.  The truncated tower has two stages.  In the lower stage is a small west window, and in the upper stage are two-light bell openings.  Only the south wall of the nave remains.  This has a central protruding doorway flanked by Ionic pilasters, and round-arched windows without tracery or glass.  The chancel has a central south door with a cartouche above it, on each side of which are two-light round-headed windows.  Both the chapel and the chancel have three-light windows.  On the north wall are a two-light and a three-light window, while on the west wall are two three-light windows.  Inside the chancel is a chancel arch and a two-bay arcade.  There are a number of memorials, the most important of which are to the Earls of Strafford and other members of the Wentworth family.  Other fittings have been removed.  In the west end of the chancel are steps leading down to the Fitzwilliam vault.

60,158,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type6,"The Sangre de Cristo Range is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in southern Colorado in the United States, running north and south along the east side of the Rio Grande Rift. The mountains extend southeast from Poncha Pass for about  through south-central Colorado to La Veta Pass, approximately  west of Walsenburg, and form a high ridge separating the San Luis Valley on the west from the watershed of the Arkansas River on the east. The Sangre de Cristo Range rises over  above the valleys and plains to the west and northeast.

According to the USGS, the range is the northern part of the larger Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which extend through northern New Mexico. 
Usage of the terms ""Sangre de Cristo Range"" and ""Sangre de Cristo Mountains"" is varied; however, this article discusses only the mountains between Poncha Pass and La Veta Pass.

Notable peaks

Geography

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains run from Poncha Pass at the north end of the San Luis Valley to Glorieta Pass near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Most of the range is shared by two National Forests, which abut along the range divide. Most of the northeast (Arkansas River) side is located within the San Isabel National Forest, while most of the southwest (San Luis Valley) side is included in the Rio Grande National Forest. The central part of the range is designated as the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness. The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve sits on the southwestern flank of the range at the edge of the San Luis Valley. The range divide is traversed by no paved roads, only by four-wheel drive and foot trails over Hayden Pass, Hermit Pass, Music Pass, Medano Pass, and Mosca Pass.

The highest peak in the range, located in the south, is Blanca Peak at ; it is flanked by three other fourteeners: Little Bear Peak, Mount Lindsey, and Ellingwood Point. Other well-known peaks are the fourteeners of the Crestone group: Kit Carson Mountain, Crestone Peak, Crestone Needle, and Humboldt Peak. Two sub-peaks of Kit Carson Mountain, Challenger Point and Columbia Point, are named in memory of the crews of the Space Shuttle Challenger and the Space Shuttle Columbia.
The range is also home to many high peaks in the 13,000 to 14,000 foot (3,900-4,300 m) range as it continues into New Mexico. In New Mexico most of the mountain area is managed by the US Forest Service in the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests.

History and economy
In 1719 the Spanish explorer Antonio Valverde y Cosio named the Sangre de Cristo (""Blood of Christ"") mountains after being impressed by the reddish hue of the snowy peaks at sunrise, alpenglow.  Today tourism is the main economic activity.

Geology
The Colorado Sangre de Cristos are fault-block mountains similar to the Teton Range in Wyoming and the Wasatch Range in Utah. There are major fault lines running along both the east and west sides of the range and, in places, cutting through the range. Like all fault-block mountain ranges, the Sangre de Cristos lack foothills which means the highest peaks rise abruptly from the valleys to the east and west, rising  in only a few miles in some places. The mountains were pushed up around 5 million years ago, basically as one large mass of rock. The Sangre de Cristo range is still being uplifted today as faults in the area remain active.

On the west side is the San Luis Valley, a portion of the Rio Grande Rift. On the southeast side is the Raton Basin, a quiet but still active volcanic field.  On the northeast side are the Wet Mountains and the Front Range, areas of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks formed during the Colorado orogeny some 1.7 billion years ago and then uplifted more recently during the Laramide orogeny.

The Blanca Massif is also Precambrian rock, while most of the rest of the Sangres is composed of younger Permian-Pennsylvanian (about 250-million-year-old) rock, a mix of sedimentary conglomerates, shales, and igneous intrusions.  These sedimentary rocks originated as sediment eroded from the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.

Sangre de Cristo National Heritage AreaIgor Galo (born 5 December 1948) is a Serbian and Croatian actor, perhaps best known for his work in Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron. He was born on 5 December 1948 in Ćuprija, SR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. After moving around Yugoslavia his family settled in Pula where Galo completed gymnasium high school in 1967. He enrolled into the University of Zagreb forestry and economics studies but quickly dropped out when he started his acting career in 1968. Over the years he appeared in over 60 cinematic and TV roles out of which at least 22 were lead role. Beyond the former Yugoslavia he appeared as Lieutenant Meyer in 1977 Cross of Iron.

In 2017, Igor Galo has signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.

46,160,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type6,"Internet.org is a partnership between social networking services company Meta Platforms and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. The app delivering these services was renamed Free Basics in September 2015. As of April 2018, 100 million people were using internet.org.

It has been criticized for violating net neutrality, and by handpicking internet services that are included, for discriminating against companies not in the list, including Facebook's rivals. In February 2016, regulators banned the Free Basics service in India based on ""Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations"". The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics. On February 11, 2016, Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India. In July 2017, Global Voices published the widespread report ""Free Basics in Real Life"" analyzing its practices in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and concluding it violates net neutrality, focuses on ""Western corporate content"", and overall ""it's not even very helpful"".

History

Internet.org was launched on August 20, 2013. At the time of launch, Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a ten-page whitepaper he had written elaborating on the vision that asserts that connectivity is a ""human right"". In the paper, he wrote that Internet.org was a further step in the direction of Facebook's past initiatives, such as Facebook Zero, to improve Internet access for people around the world.

During TechCrunch Disrupt on September 11, 2013 Zuckerberg elaborated further on his vision. TechCrunch blog compared Internet.org with Google's Project Loon. Zuckerberg also released a video on September 30, 2013 explaining Internet.org's goal of making the Internet 100 times more affordable.

On February 24, 2014, shortly before a keynote presentation by Zuckerberg at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 24, 2014, Internet.org unveiled several new projects: an education partnership called SocialEDU with Nokia and local carrier AirTel, edX, and the government in Rwanda; a project with Unilever in India; and a new Internet.org Innovation Lab with Ericsson in its Menlo Park HQ. In the presentation, Zuckerberg says that Facebook's recent acquisition of mobile messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion was closely related to the Internet.org vision.

In May 2015, Facebook announced the Internet.org Platform, an open program for developers to easily create services that integrate with Internet.org. This was seen by commentators as a response to concerns raised over net neutrality. Participating websites must meet three criteria:
 Explore the entire internet (so as to give users a taste of the wider Internet and therefore help them see the value of the Internet),
 Efficiency of data use (so that it would be economical for carriers to allow free access to the websites), and 
 Technical specifications: optimized for browsing on a wide range of devices including smartphones and less sophisticated mobile devices, and should not be dependent on JavaScript or HTTPS.

Satellite development 
On March 27, 2014, Facebook announced a connectivity lab as part of the Internet.org initiative, with the goal of bringing the Internet to everybody via drones, acquired from the company Ascenta. It is also communicated by the Connectivity Lab, that, besides using drones, low-Earth orbit and geosynchronous satellites would also be part of the project, for establishing internet connectivity in other areas. All three systems would rely on free space optics (FSO). In free space optics, the signal is sent in a compact bundle of infrared light

At Mobile World Congress March 2015, Mark Zuckerberg says that the Internet.org initiative was ""willing to work"" with Project Loon (Google's project to use high-altitude balloons to provide people cheaper Internet access) but emphasizes that in his view, the real work is in partnering with existing telecommunications companies to improve access and reduce costs for people already within range of a network, which he estimates at over 80% of the population.

In October 2015, Facebook and Eutelsat leased the entire Ka-band capacity (36 spot beams with a total throughput of 18 Gbit/s) on the planned Amos-6 satellite to provide access to parts of Africa Amos-6 was intended to be launched on Flight 29 of a SpaceX Falcon 9 to geosynchronous transfer orbit on 3 September 2016. However, on 1 September 2016, during the run-up to a static fire test, there was an anomaly on the launch pad resulting in a fire and the loss of the vehicle and its payload, Amos-6. There were no injuries.

In January 2016, Google had exited Facebook's Free Basics platform in Zambia. They were included in the initial trial of this project, which was first launched in Zambia.

Net neutrality criticism in India 
The first Internet.org summit was held on 9 October 2014 in New Delhi, India. The primary objective of this summit was to bring together experts, officials and industry leaders to focus on ways to deliver more Internet services for people in languages other than English. Zuckerberg also met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk about how Facebook and the Indian government can collaborate on Internet.org.

In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg wrote in an article for Hindustan Times stating that Internet.org and net neutrality can co-exist and Internet.org will never differentiate between services. His claims were contested by many response articles, including one published in the Hindustan Times. In May 2015, the Internet.org Platform, open to participation by any developers meeting specified guidelines, was announced. Some commentators viewed this announcement as a response to the net neutrality concerns expressed.
The PMO has expressed displeasure at Facebook's reaction to and handling of TRAI's consultation paper, calling it a crudely majoritarian and orchestrated opinion poll.

An Indian journalist, in his reply to Mark Zuckerberg's article defending Internet.org in India, criticized Internet.org as ""being just a Facebook proxy targeting India's poor"" as it provides restricted Internet access to Reliance Telecom's subscribers in India. Until April 2015, Internet.org users could access (for free) only a few websites, and Facebook's role as gatekeeper in determining what websites were in that list was criticised for violating net neutrality. In May 2015, Facebook announced that the Free Basics Platform would be opened to websites that met its criteria.

In April 2015, some Indian startups start pulling out of Internet.org to protect net neutrality. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in January 2016 criticized Facebook for its misleading commercials and astroturfing the Free Basics campaign. TRAI accused Facebook of failing to pass on the four questions in the regulator's consultation paper and also blocking access to TRAI's designated email for feedback on Free Basics. On February 8, 2016, TRAI banned the Free Basics service in India based on ""Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016"" notification. On February 11, 2016 Facebook withdrew the Free Basics platform from India.

In May 2017, Facebook, in partnership with Indian telecoms operator Bharti Airtel, launched a service under the Express Wi-Fi banner.

Reception

Expanding Internet access
An article published on Datamation in August 2013 discussed Internet.org in relation to past accessibility initiatives by Facebook and Google such as Facebook Zero, Google Free Zone, and Project Loon. Internet.org and Project Loon have been described as being engaged in an Internet space race. There have also been technical debates about the relative feasibility and value of using balloons (as championed by Project Loon) instead of drones, with Mark Zuckerberg favoring drones.

In December 2013, David Talbot wrote a detailed article for Technology Review titled Facebook's Two Faces: Facebook and Google Aim to Fix Global Connectivity, but for Whom? about Internet.org and other Internet accessibility initiatives.

User experience research
In 2015, researchers evaluating how Facebook Zero shapes information and communication technologies (ICT) usage in the developing world found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, and 61% of Indonesians agree with the statement that ""Facebook is the Internet"" compared with only 5% in the US.

The house was designed by architect Robert S. Chadsey in the Greek Revival architectural style in 1841 for the plantation owner, Augustin Marius Tureaud.

The historic house has been moved twice. After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 it was moved a further back from the levee, inside the same property in St. James Parish. In 1977 a second move, due to a purchase of the land by Missouri-Portland Cement Company, brought the house to its present location in Iberville Parish. The house was moved in one piece on a barge up Mississippi River course, about  north of its original location.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 2007.

It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of footnotes and bibliographies. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA Style Guide, which is published by the American Sociological Association, the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the United States. The ASA Style Guide, published by the American Sociological Association, is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

General features

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with APA style, the general format for citing references is parenthetical referencing. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled ""References,"" rather than ""Works Cited"" as in MLA style. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The ""author-date"" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

Software support

ASA style is supported by most major reference management software programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

Bell Records singlesMaghrebi mint tea (Maghrebi Arabic: , atay; ; ), also known as Moroccan mint tea is a North African green tea prepared with spearmint leaves and sugar. 

It is traditional to the Greater Maghreb region (the northwest African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania). Its consumption has spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France, Arab world, and Middle East. 

Mint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb. and is very popular among the Tuareg people of Algeria, Libya, Niger and Mali. The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served. The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity. The native spearmint naʿnāʿ () possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. Other hybrids and cultivars of spearmint, including yerba buena, are occasionally used as substitutes for Nana mint. In Morocco, mint tea is sometimes perfumed with herbs, flowers, or orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like pennyroyal mint and wormwood. Mint has been used as an infusion, decoction, and herbal medicine throughout the Mediterranean since Antiquity. This aromatic plant was widely used in Algeria to cure and prevent cholera when it plagued the country from 1835 until 1865.

History
Gunpowder tea was introduced into North Africa by the British in the 18th and 19th centuries via Morocco and Algeria. 

According to food historian, Helen Saberi, the drinking of green tea infused with mint spread from Morocco to Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and to nomadic tribes of Berbers and Tuareg in the Sahara.

Sugar and tea would arrive from Europe to the port of Essaouira, where Jewish merchants who had started migrating to coastal cities in the 19th century managed their passing through the interior of Morocco. James Richardson recorded a description of a Moroccan tea ceremony in the 1840s, and said that during his travels tea was drunk widely and all day long. 

Tea consumption became associated with power and prestige in Morocco, and , officer of Sultan Suleiman, became the first mūl atay ( ""master of tea"") in the Makhzen. In the twenty years after the Anglo-Moroccan Treaty of 1856, and after the British East India Company diverted tea meant for the Baltic states to Morocco during the Crimean War, tea imports quadrupled but tea consumption remained an urban practice. Among urban populations, partaking in the tea ceremony became a symbol of status and , while among rural farmers it was a way to emulate the urban class they both envied and resented. Tea consumption spread through wider segments of the population as a result of the famines of the 1880s, when it became an emergency calorie substitute, appetite suppressant, and mode of performing acculturation for rural populations flooding the cities in search of opportunities.

Another factor in the spread of atay consumption in Morocco was the comparative scarcity of coffee. Whereas Algerian cities had been introduced to coffee culture under the influence of the Ottomans, Moroccan cities would only be introduced to coffee later. Oral traditions in the Algerian city of Tlemcen distinguish between ""Fassi tea drinkers and Tlemceni coffee drinkers.""

In the late 19th century, Sufi orders led by figures such as Muhammad Bin Abdul-Kabir Al-Kattani told their adherents not to drink tea, attempting to boycott sugar and tea imported by Europeans.

By the early 20th century, mint tea had become well established in Morocco.

Preparation

The basic ingredients of the tea are green tea, fresh mint leaves, sugar, and boiling water. The proportions of the ingredients and the brewing time can vary widely. Boiling water is used in the Maghreb, rather than the cooler water that is used in East Asia to avoid bitterness. The leaves are left in the pot while the tea is consumed, changing the flavor from one glass to the next.

It is poured into glasses from high above to swirl loose tea leaves to the bottom of the glass, whilst gently aerating the tea to improve its flavor.

In the winter, if mint is rare, sometimes leaves of tree wormwood ( chiba or sheeba in Moroccan dialect) are substituted for (or used to complement) the mint, giving the tea a distinctly bitter flavor. Lemon verbena ( lwiza in Moroccan Arabic) is also used to give it a lemon flavor. Other herbs used to flavor the tea include oregano, sage, and thyme. The tea is sometimes sold as a ready-to-cook mixture of tea and dried mint, which is easier to store and to prepare but has diminished flavor. 

A simple and practical method runs as follows:
 In a teapot, combine two teaspoons of tea-leaf with a half liter of boiling water. Allow it to steep for at least 15 minutes.
 Without stirring, filter the mixture into a stainless steel pot, so that the tea leaves and coarse powder are removed.
 Add sugar (about one teaspoon per 100 milliliters).
 Bring to boil over a medium heat (this helps the sugar dissolve).
 Fresh mint leaves can be added to the teapot, or directly to the cup.

A more complex method is as follows:

The tea is first put in the teapot and a small quantity of boiling water is added. The tea is left to infuse for approximately 20–30 seconds. This initial liquid is poured out and kept aside. This is the ""spirit"" of the tea and will be added back after the tea is washed, to restore the ""spirit"" (the ""spirit"" of the tea is essentially a strong, deeply flavored liquid from the initial infusion, which adds extra flavor to the final infusion). The tea is then ""cleaned"" by adding a small quantity of boiling water; that is poured out after one minute (to lessen the bitterness). This process may be repeated more than once. Mint and sugar are added (amounts vary; approximately five teaspoons of sugar for one teaspoon of tea leaves is typical), and water at the boiling point is then poured in the pot. The pot may then be taken to heat and further boiled to increase the flavor of the infusion. After three to five minutes, a glass is served and poured back in the pot two to three times to mix the tea. Tea is then tasted (sugar if needed may be added) until the infusion is fully developed.

Traditionally, the tea is served three times. The amount of time it has been steeping gives each of the glasses of tea a unique flavor, described in this famous Maghrebi proverb:

The first glass is as gentle as life,the second is as strong as love,the third is as bitter as death.

In popular culture
In one of Nass El Ghiwane's most popular songs, Es-Siniya (), the tea tray is used as a metaphor to discuss the hardships of migrating from the countryside to a big city such as Casablanca.

16,166,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type3,"Winterbourne Earls is a village in Wiltshire, England. The village is in the Bourne valley on the A338 road, about  northeast of Salisbury.

The village adjoins Winterbourne Dauntsey. It is part of the civil parish of Winterbourne, formed in 1934 by amalgamating the three ancient parishes of Winterbourne Earls, Winterbourne Dauntsey and Winterbourne Gunner.

History
Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a settlement with 28 households at Wintreburne, on land held by Edward of Salisbury.

The name ""Earls"" came from the Earls of Salisbury who were lords of the manor in the thirteenth century. Since then, the manor has only changed hands twice: in 1551 it was leased to the Nicholas family by its owners, the Bishops of Salisbury, then in 1799 the Fort family took the lease and later bought the manor, retaining it until the mid-twentieth century.

Churches
A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1843 at Hurdcott, immediately to the south of Winterbourne Earls. The chapel closed in 1967 and the community is served by Bourne Valley Methodist Church at Winterbourne Dauntsey.

The Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels serves the village and Winterbourne Dauntsey. It was built next to the main road in 1867–8 by T.H. Wyatt and replaced an older church, probably built in the 12th century; St Edward's at Winterbourne Dauntsey was closed at the same time. Fragments of both older churches were used in the new church, and there are two roundels of 13th-century glass. The font bowl, pulpit and some of the monuments are also of older dates.

At some point before 1867, the benefices of Winterbourne Earls and Dauntsey had been united and made a perpetual curacy. Winterbourne Gunner was added to the union in 1924. A team ministry was created for the area in 1973, and in the same year the Dauntsey and Earls parishes were united. Today the church is part of the Bourne Valley Churches grouping, alongside five nearby village churches.

Facilities
Winterbourne Earls CofE Primary School serves the village and surrounding communities. The school was built in 1992 on a new site to replace a National School dating from 1872.

There is a pub at Hurdcott (the Black Horse) and another at Winterbourne Dauntsey (the Winterbourne Arms).

Notable people
Henry Sherfield (c.1572–1634, lawyer and Member of Parliament) lived in the village.

Notable members of the Nicholas family include Sir Edward Nicholas (1593–1669), MP and Secretary of State, and his younger brother Matthew (1594–1661) who rose to become Dean of St Paul's Cathedral and is buried at Winterbourne Earls.

73,168,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type1,"Mathieu Georges Dairnvaell (born: Mathieu Georges February 2, 1818, in Marseille; date of death unknown) was a French journalist and pamphleteer using the nom de plume Satan, publishing during the years 1838 to 1851. In 1846 he published a 36-page pamphlet launching the antisemitic canard that the fabulous wealth of the Rothschild banking dynasty was amassed by Nathan Rothschild through obtaining advance knowledge of the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo (1815) and using this information to successfully play the stock market. In this way, Dairnvaell contributed to the rise of what Michel Dreyfus has called ""economic antisemitism"".

In a Chartist newspaper, Friedrich Engels recommends Dairnvaell for having started ""a new mode of attack"" against financiers, in which ""King Rothschild has been obliged to publish two defenses against these attacks of a man whom nobody knows, and the whole of whose property consists in the suit of clothes he wears.""

Biography
His parents are unknown. Commenting on his unusual name, Claude Pichois points out that ""Dairnvaell"" published his pamphelts under numerous pseudonyms, the most persistent of which, ""Dairnvaell"", has multiple spellings (Dairnvæll, Dairnwoel, Dairnwœll, etc.); furthermore ""Mathieu Georges"" is possibly derived from an English name. As a boy, he studied in one of the best boarding-schools in the Midi, usually as the poorest student. His first published work was a republican satire entitled Les Moscoviennes, dedicated to Nicholas I of Russia. He followed this with two more satires, La Naissande d'un prince and Euménides. He then became a member of the editorial staff of the Indicateur of Marseille, contributing many articles on theater and the works of Shakespeare. In 1939 he published a 64-page novelette, Simon Maurice, or, noble and peasant He claims to have been editor-in-chief of Corsaire du Midi for two years.

Towards the end of 1840, Dairnvaell went to Paris, and began to publish a series of pamphlets on people, doings, and signs of the times, which he continued until December 2, 1851. In addition to the number of pamphlets that can be traced to him, there are likely many more written anonymously or under pseudonyms; in any case, they are of the moment and cramped.

Dairnvaell, who described himself as ""a writer without name, position, title or rank, not even a Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur or a member of the French Academy, an obscure scribbler,""  never rose above the level of obscurity, but his Waterloo canard has taken on a life of its own.

Battle of Waterloo canard

Derailment at Fampoux

On July 8, 1846, a train on the Northern Line, for which the de Rothschild Frères were the largest investors, derailed while passing through a marsh near the village of Fampoux, killing 57 people and wounding over 100 (). A satirical magazine, Le Charivari, published an article nine days later linking responsibility to the rail system, the Stock Exchange, and Baron James de Rothschild.

Pamphleteers fan public anger
Taking advantage of widespread outrage over the derailment, Dairnvaell wrote the first of what would be four pamphlets published in 1846 against Rothschild banking interests, entitled Histoire édifiante et curieuse de Rothschild Ier, Roi des Juifs (The Edifying and Curious History of Rothschild the First, King of the Jews) (36 pages). Baron James promptly responded with a pamphlet, also 36 pages, entitled Réponse de Rothschild I roi des juifs à Satan dernier, roi des imposteurs (The Response of Rothschild the First, King of the Jews, to Satan the Last, King of Impostors), the opening round of the pamphlet war closely followed by Friedrich Engels.

Dairnvaell's Waterloo narrative
According to Dairnvaell's dramatic, but unsubstantiated account, Nathan Rothschild was personally in Belgium observing the Battle of Waterloo. As soon as he realized that Wellington's victory was certain, he hurried to Ostend, but the sailors were unwilling to ferry him across the North Sea, because a storm was brewing. A large amount of gold changed hands before they were willing to take him to England, and he arrived in London 24 hours in advance of Wellington's messenger. Taking advantage of this Nathan and his brothers made ""twenty million"" (assume francs; one million sterling), by first selling government consols cheaply, as though they had knowledge of a French victory, and once the prices had dropped, making massive purchases. Consol bonds were the most common investment instrument in Paris at that time.

Elaborations of the Waterloo narrative
The Waterloo carnard became more believable when, instead of Nathan Mayer Rothschild being at Waterloo in person, the news of Wellington's victory is sent by carrier pigeon, or by horseback, with a skipper already under contract and waiting with a ship to ferry the courier across the North Sea. That the Rothschilds had their own courier system was well known, and this story would seem to be a prime example of that.

The story is also told in a version in which economist David Ricardo was the beneficiary of advance news, which he used to amass a fortune on the stock exchange. This version was believed in by Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, Paul Samuelson.

Antisemitism in FranceColoboma of optic nerve, is a rare defect of the optic nerve that causes moderate to severe visual field defects.

Coloboma of the optic nerve is a congenital anomaly of the optic disc in which there is a defect of the inferior aspect of the optic nerve. The issue stems from incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure while in utero. A varying amount of glial tissue typically fills the defect, manifests as a white mass.

Signs and symptoms
Vision in the affected eye is impaired, the degree of which depends on the size of the defect, and typically affects the visual field more than visual acuity. Additionally, there is an increased risk of serous retinal detachment, manifesting in 1/3 of patients. If retinal detachment does occur, it is usually not correctable and all sight is lost in the affected area of the eye, which may or may not involve the macula.

Diagnosis
The first noticeable signs of the syndrome usually do not appear until after the first twelve months of the child’s life. The child usually has severe balance issues as he or she learns to sit or walk, often leaning or tilting the head toward the good eye to correct the brain’s skewed perception of the world. Often the child will fall in the same direction while walking or run into objects that are placed on his or her blind side. Additionally, family members may notice a white reflex in the pupil of an affected child instead of the normal red reflex when taking photographs. The presence of this phenomenon is dependent on the degree of the coloboma, with larger colobomas more likely to manifest this particular phenomenon.

This anomaly must be confirmed through pupillary dilation and examination of the optic disc, as the symptoms alone do not constitute a diagnosis.

People with optic nerve colobomas live relatively normal lives. Although non-prescription glasses should be worn for eye protection, this syndrome does not usually prevent the individual from living a normal life, driving cars, playing sports, reading, etc. Certain activities, however, may be more difficult for patients with optic nerve colobomas due to a compromised view of the world. Like most other eye conditions, a diagnosis of optic nerve coloboma precludes a person from certain occupations.

Comparison with morning glory disc anomaly
Although both optic nerve colobomas and morning glory disc anomaly (MGDA) involve mutations of the PAX6 gene, these two separate diseases represent two distinct causes. An optic nerve coloboma is easily differentiated from morning glory anomaly. Colobomas affect only the inferior aspect of the nerve as it represents an incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure, whereas MGDA encompasses all aspects of the nerve and represents more generally a dysgenesis of the mesoderm.

Towering at 6 feet 6 inches, Wertheim was known for his strong wrists and vigorous play.

Biography
Wertheim was born on 22 December 1893, in Melbourne Victoria, the second son of Hugo Wertheim and Sophie Emilie. His parents were both emigrants from Germany, who settled in Melbourne in the 1880s. He had four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. One of his sisters is the grandmother of former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett. The business which his father founded, Wertheim Pianos, was highly successful and made the family a well known name in Australia. It is said that Nellie Melba would request to use Wertheim pianos for her performances.

From 1901 to 1910, Wertheim attended Melbourne Church of England Grammar School before following his older brother into Trinity College, one of the residential colleges of the University of Melbourne, in March 1911.  Following his studies, he worked for a period of time in the family business.

An interstate tennis player for Victoria, Wertheim first competed in the Australasian Championships in 1911, as a 17-year-old. At the 1914 Australasian Championships he reached the semi-finals in the singles competition, which remained his best performance. His loss in the semi-finals was to eventual champion Arthur O'Hara Wood, a fellow alumnus from his residential college, in four sets.

Due to his German heritage, Wertheim was nicknamed ""Sos"" or ""Soss"", for sausage. He later served in Germany as a member of the Australian Imperial Force during World War I. After enlisting in 1915, Wertheim went to Gallipoli with the 23rd Battalion but only saw the final month of the campaign. He transferred after that to the 2nd Pioneer Battalion in March 1916 and fought in Pozières from July to August and then in Flers. In 1917 he was seconded to the Intelligence Corps and is credited with obtaining vital information from a German prisoner to avert a planned counter-attack. He was mentioned in despatches three times during the war, included those of Douglas Haig, for his interrogation of the German prisoner. In 1919 he returned to Australia.

He continued his tennis career in the 1920s and was a regular competitor at the Australasian Championships. Although he wasn't able to reach the final four again he was a doubles semi-finalist on four occasions, with Timothy Fitchett in 1924, Garton Hone in 1925 and Richard Schlesinger in both 1926 and 1929.

The 1922 season saw Wertheim called up to the Australian team for the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) and he played in a quarter-final tie against Czechoslovakia in London. He featured in the doubles, with Gerald Patterson, which they won in straight sets, over Karel Ardelt and Friedrich Rohrer. It was the only rubber he would ever play and he later would jocularly declare that he was one of the few players to be unbeaten in the Davis Cup. While in England he competed at Wimbledon and was runner-up in the All England Plate, after a second round exit in the main draw. He then travelled with the Davis Cup team to America and although he wasn't required for the Davis Cup ties did appear at the U.S. National Championships.

One of his finest wins came when he defeated Patterson, then a two-time Wimbledon winner, at the 1925 Victorian Championships.

A stock broker, he co-founded a brokerage business called Williams & Wertheim in Collins Street.

Illness ended his tennis career in 1929 and for two years he remained bedridden as a result. He recovered well enough to return to work but on 12 October 1933 died at a hospital in East Melbourne after collapsing in the city. His funeral was held at Brighton Cemetery. He was married to Marjorie Felstead, the younger sister of the golfer Claude Felstead. They had with three sons.

7,173,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type3,"Shērōē (also spelled Shīrūya, New Persian: ), better known by his dynastic name of Kavad II ( Kawād; New Persian: قباد Qobād or Qabād), was king (shah) of the Sasanian Empire briefly in 628. He was the son of Khosrow II (), whom he succeeded after having him overthrown in a coup d'état. Kavad's reign is seen as a turning point in Sasanian history, and has been argued by some scholars as playing a key role in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

Background and rise 
Sheroe was the son of Khosrow II, the last prominent king (shah) of the Sasanian Empire, and Maria, a Greek woman, who was reportedly a Byzantine princess. Sheroe was later imprisoned by his father, who wanted to ensure the succession of his favorite son Mardanshah, the son of his favorite wife, Shirin. His father's reputation had been ruined during the last phase of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628. In 627, the Sasanian general Rhahzadh was slain and Dastgerd, the king's favorite residence, had been sacked into oblivion by Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who was advancing towards the nearby Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. In 628, Sheroe was released by the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, which included the Ispahbudhan spahbed (""army chief"") Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; Shahrbaraz of the House of Mihran; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni and finally the kanarang of the eastern Sasanian province of Abarshahr.

Reign 
On 25 February, Sheroe, along with his commander Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. He then proclaimed himself as shah of the Sasanian Empire and assumed the dynastic name of Kavad II. He proceeded to have all his brothers and half-brothers executed, including the heir Mardanshah, who was Khosrow's favourite son. The murder of all his brothers, ""all well-educated, valiant, and chivalrous men"", stripped the Sasanian dynasty of a future competent ruler and has been described as a ""mad rampage"" and ""reckless"". Three days later he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. However, after the regicide of his father, Kavad also proceeded to have Mihr Hormozd killed. His sisters Boran and Azarmidokht reportedly criticized and scolded him for his barbaric actions, which made him filled with remorse.

Due to Kavad's actions, his reign is seen as a turning point in Sasanian history, and has been argued by some scholars as playing a key role in the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The overthrow and death of Khosrow culminated in a chaotic civil war, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (Parsig) and Parthian (Pahlav) noble-families were also resumed, which split up the wealth of the nation. With the agreement of the Iranian nobles, he then made peace with the victorious emperor Heraclius, which allowed the Byzantines to (re)gain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.

Kavad granted complete religious freedom to Christians under his rule. He also appointed Armenian nobleman Varaztirots II Bagratuni as marzban (general of a frontier province, ""margrave"")  of Sasanian Armenia, and appointed Ishoyahb II (628–645) as the new Catholicos (Eastern Patriarch) of the Nestorian Church of the East (at Seleucia-Ctesiphon). 

Kavad died from plague after a few months' reign on 6 September 628. The grandees (wuzurgan) of the empire elected his eight-year-old son Ardashir III. In reality, however, he exercised little power and his empire was controlled by his vizier Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, whose duty was to protect the empire until Ardashir became old enough to rule.

Marriage
A passage of the Chronicle of Edessa identifies ""Anzoy the Roman"" as the wife of Kavad II and mother of Ardashir III. She was probably a Christian princess from the Byzantine Empire.

Children of Khosrow IIThe 2008 Australian Club Championships (ACC) brought together the best men's and women's basketball teams from the Waratah League, South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL), Queensland Australian Basketball League (QABL), Central Australian Basketball League (CABL) and Big V competitions for their shot at national glory, with the event held at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre.

By the tournament's conclusion, the Rockhampton Rockets were crowned as the best male basketball club in Australia while the Townsville Flames were crowned women's champions for the second year in succession. The tournament was the final ACC National Finals after the Australian Basketball Association (ABA) was disbanded following the 2008 season.

Tournament overview
The 2008 ACC quarter-finals began on 16 August when the two SEABL men's conference champions, the Hobart Chargers (South) and the Knox Raiders (East), faced off for the overall SEABL championship and a spot in the ACC semi-finals.

The remaining 14 teams (eight women's and six men's) then faced off against each other on 23 August to determine who would be heading to the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre on 30 August for the semi-finals.

The Rockhampton Rockets booked their place in the men's decider after a thrilling 100–93 victory over the Sandringham Sabres in the semi-final, while the Chargers defeated the Melbourne Tigers 128–126 in overtime in the other semi-final. In the men's Grand Final, the Rockets defeated the Chargers in a cliff hanger, 103–99, with grand final MVP Ryan McDade finishing with 24 points and 19 rebounds.

In the women's Grand Final, the Townsville Flames made it double celebrations for Queensland teams, clinching back-to-back national women's championships. The Flames, who edged out the
Kilysth Cobras 77–71 in their semi, overpowered the Sydney Comets 73–57 in the decider. A Flames win looked on the cards at halftime when they led 38–26, but Sydney responded with a 22–10 third-quarter run to level the scores before Townsville went on a devastating 25–9 run spearheaded by MVP Cherie Smith to seal the Championship. The win marked the second year in a row that Queensland's champions completed a men's and women's ACC double.

Participants
To qualify for the event, teams had to be crowned Champion of their respective Leagues. There were also a number of wildcard entries.

Living peopleA stain is a discoloration that can be clearly distinguished from the surface, material, or medium it is found upon. They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Accidental staining may make materials appear used, degraded or permanently unclean. Intentional staining is used in biochemical research and for artistic effect, such as wood staining, rust staining and stained glass.

Types
There can be intentional stains (such as wood stains or paint), indicative stains (such as food coloring or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural stains (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental stains such as ketchup and synthetic oil on a shirt.

Different types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering.

Formation
The primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface. The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.

A secondary method of stain involves a chemical or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.

Finally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a covalent bond and showing the color of the bound substance.

Properties
In many cases, stains are affected by heat and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Applied heat, such as from ironing, dry cleaning or sunlight, can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical.

Removal
Various laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or reduce existing stains. Stain remover is an important type of chemical in laundry detergents and some removers are formulated to be applied directly onto stains. The removal of some stains require other chemicals or special techniques. Use of an inappropriate technique could make permanent an otherwise removable stain or cause unwanted discolouration of the clothing.

Information about stain removal can be found in magazines, books, advertisements or online:

23,180,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type4,"Immunocontraception is the use of an animal's immune system to prevent it from fertilizing offspring. Contraceptives of this type are not currently available for human use.

Typically immunocontraception involves the administration of a vaccine that induces an adaptive immune response which causes an animal to become temporarily infertile. Contraceptive vaccines have been used in numerous settings for the control of wildlife populations. However, experts in the field believe that major innovations are required before immunocontraception can become a practical form of contraception for human beings.

Thus far immunocontraception has focused on mammals exclusively. There are several targets in mammalian sexual reproduction for immune inhibition. They can be organized into three categories.

Gamete production Organisms that undergo sexual reproduction must first produce gametes, cells which have half the typical number of chromosomes of the species. Often immunity that prevents gamete production also inhibits secondary sexual characteristics and so has effects similar to castration.

Gamete function After gametes are produced in sexual reproduction, two gametes must combine during fertilization to form a zygote, which again has the full typical number of chromosomes of the species. Methods that target gamete function prevent this fertilization from occurring and are true contraceptives.

Gamete outcome Shortly after fertilization a zygote develops into a multicellular embryo that in turn develops into a larger organism. In placental mammals this process of gestation occurs inside the reproductive system of the mother of the embryo. Immunity that targets gamete outcome induces abortion of an embryo while it is within its mother's reproductive system.

Medical use
Immunocontraception in not currently available but is under study.

Obstacles

Variability of immunogenicity 

In order for an immunocontraceptive to be palatable for human use, it would need to meet or exceed the efficacy rates of currently popular forms of contraception. Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy is due to variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the exact same vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.

This trend—high efficacy when antibody titers are above a threshold coupled with variability in how many animals reach such a threshold—is seen throughout immunocontraception and immune-based birth control research. A long-term study of PZP vaccination in deer that spanned 6 years found that infertility was directly related to antibody titers to PZP. The phase II clinical trial of hCG vaccines was quite successful among women who had antibody titers above 50 ng/mL, but quite poor among those with antibody titers below this threshold.

Lack of mucosal immunity 
Mucosal immunity, which includes immune function in the female reproductive tract, is not as well understood as humoral immunity. This may be an issue for certain contraceptive vaccines. For instance, in the second LDH-C4 primate trial that had negative results, all of the immunized macaque monkeys developed high antibody titers against LDH-C4 in serum, but antibodies against LDH-C4 were not found in the monkeys' vaginal fluids. If antibodies against LDH-C4 do indeed inhibit fertilization, then this result highlights how the difference in the functioning of mucosal immunity from humoral immunity may be critical to the efficacy of contraceptive vaccines.

Adverse effects 
Whenever an immune response is provoked, there is some risk of autoimmunity. Therefore, immunocontraception trials typically check for signs of autoimmune disease. One concern with zona pellucida vaccination, in particular, is that in certain cases it appears to be correlated with ovarian pathogenesis. However, ovarian disease has not been observed in every trial of zona pellucida vaccination, and when observed, has not always been irreversible.

Gamete production

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
The production of gametes is induced in both male and female mammals by the same two hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The production of these in turn is induced by a single releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which has been the focus of most of the research into immunocontraception against gamete production. GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus in pulses and travels to the anterior pituitary gland through a portal venous system. There it stimulates the production of FSH and LH. FSH and LH travel through the general circulatory system and stimulate the functioning of the gonads, including the production of gametes and the secretion of sex steroid hormones. Immunity against GnRH thus lessens FSH and LH production which in turn attenuates gamete production and secondary sexual characteristics.

While GnRH immunity has been known to have contraceptive effects for some time, only in the 2000s has it been used to develop several commercial vaccines. Equity® Oestrus Control is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in non-breeding domestic horses. Repro-Bloc is GnRH vaccine marketed for use in domestic animals in general. Improvac® is a GnRH vaccine marketed for use in pigs not as a contraceptive, but as an alternative to physical castration for the control of boar taint. Unlike the other products which are marketed for use in domestic animals, GonaCon™ is a GnRH vaccine being developed as a United States Department of Agriculture initiative for use for control of wildlife, specifically deer. GonaCon has also been used on a trial basis to control kangaroos in Australia.

Gamete function 

The form of sexual reproduction practiced by most placental mammals is anisogamous, requiring two kinds of dissimilar gametes, and allogamous, such that each individual only produces one of the two kinds of gametes. The smaller gamete is the sperm cell and is produced by males of the species. The larger gamete is the ovum and is produced by females of the species. Under this scheme, fertilization requires two gametes, one from an individual of each sex, in order to occur. Immunocontraception targeting the female gamete has focused on the zona pellucida. Immunocontraception targeting the male gamete has involved many different antigens associated with sperm function.

Zona pellucida 

The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein membrane surrounding the plasma membrane of an ovum. The zona pellucida's main function in reproduction is to bind sperm. Immunity against zonae pellucidae causes an animal to produce antibodies that themselves are bound by a zona pellucida. Thus when a sperm encounters an ovum in an animal immunized against zonae pellucidae, the sperm cannot bind to the ovum because its zona pellucida has already been occupied by antibodies. Therefore, fertilization does not occur.

Early research 

Work begun by researchers at the University of Tennessee in the 1970s into immunity against zonae pellucidae resulted in its identification as a target antigen for immunocontraception. The zona pellucida's suitability is a result of it being necessary for fertilization and containing at least one antigen that is tissue-specific and not species-specific. The tissue-specificity implies that immunity against zonae pellucidae will not also affect other tissues in the immunized animal's body. The lack of species-specificity implies that zonae pellucidae harvested from animals of one species will induce an immune response in those of another, which makes zona pellucida antigens readily available, since zonae pellucidae can be harvested from farm animals.

Zonagen 

In 1987, a pharmaceutical company called Zonagen (later renamed Repros Therapeutics) was started with the goal of developing zona pellucida vaccines as an alternative to the surgical sterilization of companion animals and eventually as a contraceptive for human use. The products would be based on research being done at the Baylor College of Medicine by Bonnie S. Dunbar that was funded by Zonagen. However, the relationship between Zonagen and Bonnie Dunbar ended acrimoniously in 1993. Despite claims later that year that development of a contraceptive vaccine was imminent and an agreement with Schering AG for funding for joint development of a contraceptive vaccine for human use, no vaccine was made commercially available and the agreement with Schering was terminated after primate studies were disappointing. The company would go on to pursue other projects and be renamed.

Application to wildlife population control 

Also in the late 1980s, research began into the use of vaccines based around zonae pellucidae harvested from pigs for the purpose of wildlife control. Such porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccines were tested in captive and domestic horses in 1986 with encouraging results. This led to the first successful field trial of contraceptive vaccines with free-ranging wildlife, which examined PZP vaccines used upon wild horses of Assateague Island National Seashore in 1988. The successful results of the field trial were maintained by annual booster inoculations.

Following the success of trials with horses, initial trials using captive animals showed promise for the use of PZP vaccines with white-tailed deer and with African elephants. This led to successful field trials of PZP vaccines in white-tailed deer at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, VA from September 1992 to September 1994 and in African elephants of Kruger National Park in South Africa in 1996.

As a result of these successes, PZP vaccination has become the most popular form of immunocontraception for wildlife. As of 2011, thousands of animals are treated with PZP vaccination every year, including 6 different species of free-ranging wildlife in 52 different locations and 76 captive exotic species in 67 different zoological gardens.

Bio Farma 

In 2012, researchers from Brawijaya University in conjunction with pharmaceutical company Bio Farma received a grant from the Indonesian government to develop a zona pellucida contraceptive vaccine for human use. Instead of pigs, the zonae pellucidae for the program are harvested from cows. The program hopes to mass-produce a contraceptive vaccine in Indonesia in 2013 at the earliest.

Viral and microbial vectors 

While contraceptive vaccines can be delivered remotely, they still require administration to each individual animal that is to be made infertile. Thus contraceptive vaccines have been used to control only relatively small populations of wildlife. Australia and New Zealand have large populations of European invasive species for which such approach will not scale. Research in these countries has therefore focused on genetically modifying viruses or microorganisms that infect the unwanted invasive species to contain immunocontraceptive antigens.

Such research has included targeting the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Australia by engineering rabbit zona pellucida glycoproteins into a recombinant myxoma virus. This approach has induced marginal reduction of fertility in laboratory rabbits with some of the glycoproteins. Further improvement of efficacy is necessary before such an approach is ready for field trials. Research has also targeted the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in Australia by engineering murine zona pellucida antigens into a recombinant ectromelia virus and a recombinant cytomegalovirus. The latter approach has induced permanent infertility when injected into laboratory mice. However, there is some attenuation of efficacy when it is actually transmitted virally.

In addition to rabbits and mice, this approach has been explored for other animals. Researchers have attempted to replicate similar results when targeting the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in Australia using such vectors as Salmonella typhimurium, vaccinia, and canine herpesvirus, but no reduction in fertility has been achieved thus far for a variety of reasons. Initial exploration into the control of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand using the nematode Parastrongyloides trichosuri has identified it as a possible immunocontraceptive vector.

Sperm 

In placental mammals, fertilization typically occurs inside the female in the oviducts. The oviducts are positioned near the ovaries where ova are produced. An ovum therefore needs only to travel a short distance to the oviducts for fertilization. In contrast sperm cells must be highly motile, since they are deposited into the female reproductive tract during copulation and must travel through the cervix (in some species) as well as the uterus and the oviduct (in all species) to reach an ovum. Sperm cells that are motile are spermatozoa.

Spermatozoa are protected from the male's immune system by the blood-testis barrier. However, spermatozoa are deposited into the female in semen, which is mostly the secretions of the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands. In this way antibodies generated by the male are deposited into the female along with spermatozoa. Because of this and the extensive travel in the female reproductive tract, spermatozoa are susceptible to anti-sperm antibodies generated by the male in addition to waiting anti-sperm antibodies generated by the female.

Early research 

In 1899, the discovery of the existence of antibodies against sperm was made independently both by Serge Metchnikoff of the Pasteur Institute and by Nobel prize laureate Karl Landsteiner.

In 1929, the first recorded attempt at immunocontraception was made by Morris Baskin, clinical director of the Denver Maternal Hygiene Committee. In this trial 20 women who were known to have at least 1 prior pregnancy were injected with their husband's semen, and no conception was recorded in 1 year of observation of these couples. A United States patent (number 2103240) was issued in 1937 for this approach as a contraceptive, but no product for widespread consumption ever came from this approach.

Renewed interest 

Throughout the 1990s, there was a resurgence of research in immunocontraception targeting sperm with the hope of developing a contraceptive vaccine for human use. Unlike earlier research which explored the contraceptive effect of immune responses to whole sperm cells, contemporary research has focused on searching for specific molecular antigens that are involved with sperm function.

Antigens that have been identified as potential targets for immunocontraception include the sperm-specific peptides or proteins ADAM,  LDH-C4,  sp10,  sp56,  P10G,  fertilization antigen 1 (FA-1),  sp17,  SOB2,  A9D,  CD52,  YLP12,  Eppin,  CatSper,  Izumo,  sperm associated antigen 9 (SPAG9),  80 kilodalton human sperm antigen (80 kDa HSA),  and nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (tNASP).

Early primate trials had mixed results. One study examined the sperm-specific isozyme of human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4) combined with a T-cell epitope to create a synthetic peptide that acted as a more potent chimeric antigen. Vaccination of female baboons with this synthetic peptide resulted in a reduced fertility in the trial. However, a second study that examined vaccination of female macaque monkeys with the same synthetic peptide did not find reduced fertility.

Since then, a study examining vaccination based on an epididymal protease inhibitor (Eppin) in male macaque monkeys demonstrated that vaccination against sperm antigens could be an effective, reversible contraceptive in male primates. While 4 of 6 control monkeys impregnated females during the trial, none of the 7 monkeys included in the trial that were vaccinated against Eppin impregnated females, and 4 of these 7 vaccinated monkeys recovered their fertility within a year and a half of observation after the trial.

This illustrated that not only could sperm immunocontraception be effective, but it could have several advantages over zona pellucida vaccines. For instance, sperm vaccines could be used by males, in addition to females.

Additionally, while there are relatively few glycoproteins in the zona pellucida and thus relatively few target antigens for zona pellucida vaccines, more than a dozen prospective target antigens for the inhibition of sperm function have been identified. This relative abundance of prospective target antigens makes the prospects of a multivalent vaccine better for sperm vaccines. A study which examined the use of one such multivalent vaccine in female macaque monkeys found that the monkeys produced antibodies against all antigens included in the vaccine, suggesting the efficacy of the multivalent approach.

Finally, while there has been autoimmune ovarian pathogenesis found in some trials using zona pellucida vaccines, anti-sperm antibodies are not likely to have adverse health effects, since anti-sperm antibodies are produced by up to 70% of men who have had vasectomies, and there has been much investigation into possible adverse health side-effects of the vasectomy procedure.

Passive immunity 

A vaccine induces active immunity when antigens are injected into an animal that cause it to produce desired antibodies itself. In passive immunity the desired antibody titers are achieved by injecting antibodies directly into an animal. The efficacy of such an approach for immunocontraception was demonstrated as early as the 1970s with antibodies against zonae pellucidae in mice during the investigation of the mechanism by which such antibodies inhibited fertility. Because the variability of individual immune response is an obstacle to bringing contraceptive vaccines to market, there has been research into the approach of contraception through passive immunization as an alternative that would be of less duration, but be closer to market. Research done using phage display technology on lymphocytes from immunoinfertile men led to the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of specific antibodies that inhibit fertility by acting against several of the known sperm antigens. This detailed molecular knowledge of antisperm antibodies may be of use in the development of a passive immunocontraceptive product.

Gamete outcome

Human chorionic gonadotropin 

Most of the research into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, it was found that anti-hCG antibodies prevent marmoset embryos from implanting in the endometrium of their mother's uterus.

The main function of hCG is to sustain the ovarian corpus luteum during pregnancy past the time it would normally decay as part of the regular menstrual cycle. For the first 7–9 weeks in humans, the corpus luteum secretes the progesterone necessary to maintain the viability of the endometrium for pregnancy. Therefore, immunity against hCG during this time frame would function as an abortifacient, as confirmed by experiments in baboons. In the scientific literature the more inclusive term ""birth control vaccine"" rather than ""contraceptive vaccine"" is used to refer to hCG vaccines.

Clinical trials 

Research begun in the 1970s led to clinical trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a tetanus toxoid. The women had previously had tubal ligations. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found.

This was followed by another phase I trial in 1977-1978 examining previously sterilized women at 5 institutions in India with a more potent vaccine that combined the beta subunit of hCG with the alpha subunit of ovine luteinizing hormone to form a heterospecies dimer conjugated with both tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid. The multiple carriers were used because it was found that a small percentage of women acquired carrier-specific immunosuppression due to repeated injection of conjugates with the same carrier.

This more potent version of the vaccine was used in a phase II (efficacy) trial during 1991-1993 conducted at 3 locations: the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi, and the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh. Primary immunization consisted of 3 injections at 6 week intervals, and 148 women known to be previously fertile completed primary immunization. All women generated antibodies against hCG, but only 119 (80%) generated antibody titers clearly above 50 ng/mL, which was the estimated level for efficacy. Blood samples were taken twice a month, and booster injections were given when antibody titers declined below 50 ng/mL in women who wished to continue using the vaccine. At the completion of the study after 1224 menstrual cycles observed, only 1 pregnancy occurred in a woman having an antibody titer level above 50 ng/mL, and 26 pregnancies occurred among women who had titers below 50 ng/mL.

Application to cancer therapy 

Following these clinical trails of hCG vaccination as a birth control method, hCG was discovered to be expressed in certain kinds of malignant neoplasms, including breast cancer, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, progressive vulvar carcinoma, carcinoma of the bladder, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cervical carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, lung carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. Therefore, immunity against hCG has applications such as imaging of cancer cells, selective delivery of cytotoxic compounds to tumor cells, and in at least one case, direct therapeutic effect by preventing establishment, inhibiting the growth, and causing the necrosis of tumors. This has led to interest in developing hCG vaccines specifically for cancer treatment.

Ongoing research 

The vaccine tested in the phase II clinical trial in India did not proceed further because it produced antibody titers of 50 ng/mL for at least 3 months duration in only 60% of women in the trial. Ongoing research in hCG birth control vaccines has focused on improving immunogenicity. A vaccine in which the beta subunit of hCG is fused to the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin has been effective in laboratory mice. It has been approved by the Indian National Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and is being produced for pre-clinical toxicology testing. If it is determined to be safe, it is planned for clinical trials.

Wildlife control 

Immunocontraception is one of the few alternatives to lethal methods for the direct control of wildlife populations. While there was research into the use of hormonal contraception for wildlife control as early as the 1950s that produced pharmacologically effective products, they all proved to be ineffective for wildlife control for a variety of practical reasons. Field trials of immunocontraception in wildlife, on the other hand, established that contraceptive vaccines could be delivered remotely by capture gun, were safe to use in pregnant animals, were reversible, and induced long-lasting infertility, overcoming these practical limitations.

One concern about the use of hormonal contraceptives in general, but especially in wildlife, is that the sex steroid hormones that are used are easily passed, often via the food chain, from animal to animal. This can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, fish exposed to treated human sewage effluents were found to have concentrations of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel in blood plasma higher than those found in humans taking hormonal contraceptives. Because the antigens used in contraceptive vaccines are protein, not steroids, they are not easily passed from animal to animal without loss of function.

1973 birthsCumnock (Cumnag in Gaelic) is a town in East Ayrshire, Scotland. The town sits at the confluence of the Glaisnock Water and the Lugar Water. There are three neighbouring housing projects which lie just outside the town boundaries, Craigens, Logan and Netherthird, with the former ironworks settlement of Lugar also just outside the town, contributing to a population of around 13,000 in the immediate locale. A new housing development, Knockroon, was granted planning permission on 9 December 2009 by East Ayrshire Council.

The town is home to the Robert Burns Academy, a new educational campus housing the main Robert Burns Academy secondary school following the merger of Cumnock Academy and Auckinleck Academy, Lochnorris Primary School and Cherry Trees Early Childhood Centre. The campus is the largest educational establishment in Scotland.

History

Early Cumnock

Etymology
The origin of the name ""Cumnock"" has been debated over the years and several interpretations have been offered.
Com-cnoc, (hollow of the hills)
Com-oich, (meeting of the waters)
Cam-cnoc, (crooked hill)
Cumanag, (little shrine)

Early history
This part of Ayrshire has seen human settlement for over 5,000 years. There are many Bronze Age burial sites around the nearby area.

Medieval history
It is believed that a place of worship has existed in Cumnock's Square for over 1,100 years, though the records begin in about 1275. The patron saint of Cumnock is Saint Conval. James IV created the Burgh of Cumnock. Three castles existed in the parish of Old Cumnock, namely Borland, Terringzean and Lefnories or Lochnorris. Lefnories was the largest and was replaced as a dwelling by Dumfries House, with only the below ground foundations remaining, excavated by the Marquess of Bute in the late 19th century.

William Wallace allegedly spent three months in the seat of Patrick Dunbar ((New) Cumnock or Cumno in 1296), according to the poem The Wallace, by Blind Harry. Robert the Bruce, Robert I, was in Cumnock in 1307 being pursued by two of Edward I's men: Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and John MacDougall of Lorn. The latter used Bruce's own bloodhound to track him. Bruce evaded capture and the bloodhound lost the scent when Bruce waded into a stream.

Cumnock is also in the heart of Robert Burns country and the poet is said to have spent time there.

Industrial Cumnock

Cumnock housed many miners, and also served as the market town for the other, smaller towns in the district, like Auchinleck, Lugar, Muirkirk, Ochiltree and New Cumnock (the original Cumnock/Comenagh/Comno etc.)

The town has a strong socialist heritage due to its history as a mining centre. The father of the Labour Party, James Keir Hardie, lived in the town for a large part of his life, and his statue sits outside the town hall. A small housing scheme in the town (Keir Hardie Hill) is named after him. The left-wing politician Emrys Hughes was local MP for a time in the mid-20th century, and also lived in the town.

Churches
 
The town has six churches, five Protestant churches, the Congregational Church, Old Cumnock Old Parish Church, St Andrew's United Free Church, Cumnock Trinity Church, Cumnock Baptist Church, and the Roman Catholic St John the Evangelist Church (1878–1880), by architect William Burges for the third Marquess of Bute.

Sports
The local football team is Cumnock Juniors, who compete in the  and play their home matches at Townhead Park.  The team is famous for their bitter rivalry with local neighbours, Auchinleck Talbot. 
The town also boasts an athletics park and rugby club Cumnock RFC, as well as a modern sports centre containing fitness gym and swimming pool.

Notable residents
 Mark Bennett, Scottish international rugby player
 James MacMillan, composer
 George Burley, former footballer mostly playing for Ipswich Town, and manager for Ipswich Town, Derby County etc.

15,185,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type3,"The Hardy Boyz are an American professional wrestling tag team consisting of real-life brothers Matt and Jeff Hardy. They first began teaming together in 1993 on the independent circuit, winning the NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship in NWA and founding OMEGA Championship Wrestling, where they held the OMEGA Tag Team Championship. They signed contracts with the WWF (now WWE) in 1997. In 2000, they were joined by Lita, and the trio became Team Xtreme. They are considered as one of the greatest tag teams of all time in professional wrestling history, they are the only team to have held the WWE/World, WCW, TNA, ROH, Raw, and SmackDown Tag Team Championships. In 2012, WWE named them the greatest tag team in WWE history.

After splitting up as a team in 2002, the brothers reunited in 2006 and teamed up sporadically afterward. They also appeared in Impact Wrestling (formerly TNA) to briefly reunite in 2011 as members of Immortal, and teamed more frequently from 2014 to 2017. Both brothers left Impact in 2017, and returned to WWE, where they would go on to win the Raw Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 33. They would team up together in WWE on and off over the next two years. In 2019, they won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship the night after WrestleMania 35, but would relinquish the titles three weeks later after Jeff suffered a leg injury. Jeff would then be out of action for the rest of the year, marking the last appearance of the team during their latest run in WWE, as Matt's contract expired in March 2020 and he went to AEW soon after.

Both brothers have also won singles championships, with each becoming multi-time world champions in their own right. In 2017, they held seven tag team championships from seven different companies at the same time, including the ROH World Tag Team Championship and the TNA World Tag Team Championship, being recognized as the only tag team in history to hold these titles simultaneously. After returning to WWE in 2017, they became the only tag team in history to have held tag team championships from all three major U.S. promotions within the span of a month.

The Hardy Boyz gained fame for their innovative participation in ladder matches and Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches with The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian. Overall, they are 12-time world tag team champions between WWE, TNA, and ROH, having won the WWE/World Tag Team Championship six times, the Raw Tag Team Championship once, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship once, the WCW Tag Team Championship once (in WWE), the TNA World Tag Team Championship twice, and the ROH World Tag Team Championship once.

History

Independent circuit (1993–1998) 
The brothers formed a tag team in 1993 after Jeff's debut in the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF). The promotion went by several names, and it was modernized in 1997 as the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA). The duo worked in several independent promotions throughout North Carolina, holding the OMEGA Tag Team Championship and NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship.

World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment  (1998–2009)

Rise to popularity (1998–1999) 

Originally the brothers competed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as jobbers—wrestlers who consistently lose to make their opponents look stronger – both in singles and tag team competition. After being signed to a contract in 1998, they were trained by Dory Funk, Jr. in his Funkin' Dojo.

The Hardy Boyz started their run as a popular tag team with a win over Kaientai (Men's Teioh and Shoichi Funaki) on the September 27, 1998 episode of Sunday Night Heat. Soon after their Sunday Night Heat win, they built up a fan base following through their high-flying tag team tactics. They started to become serious contenders for the Tag Team Championship after they became managed by Michael Hayes, formerly a member of The Fabulous Freebirds. On the June 29, 1999, episode of Raw Is War (aired July 5), they defeated The Acolytes (Faarooq and Bradshaw) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship, but they re-lost the title to The Acolytes a little less than a month later at Fully Loaded.

They eventually dumped Hayes as their manager in August 1999, becoming villains and briefly associating themselves with Gangrel as part of The New Brood. After winning a series of matches against the team of Edge and Christian—dubbed the Terri Invitational Tournament—they won the services of Terri Runnels as their manager by winning the first ever tag team ladder match at No Mercy, and then dumped Gangrel the next night becoming faces. The fans also gave both teams a standing ovation the next night on Raw Is War. This began an over two year rivalry between the Hardy Boyz and the team of Edge and Christian. During this time, they also gained notoriety as a faction with Lita.

Team Xtreme (2000–2002) 

With the addition of Lita, Matt and Jeff comprised the trio dubbed Team Xtreme, their name serving as a reflection of their ""extreme"" high-flying moves. In 2000, they were involved in feuds with Edge and Christian and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in many ladder matches and TLC matches.

They faced Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz at WrestleMania 2000 in a triple threat tag team ladder match. The Dudley Boyz started the match as the champions and Edge and Christian won the title. The Hardyz faced Edge and Christian for the title at Insurrextion and defeated them by disqualification, which meant that Edge and Christian retained the title. At King of the Ring, the Hardy Boyz squared off in a Four Corners Elimination match for the Tag Team Championship which included the champions Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty), T & A (Test and Albert) and Edge and Christian. The Hardyz were able to eliminate T & A before getting eliminated themselves by Edge and Christian.

At SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz were defeated in the first ever TLC match for the title, which Edge and Christian won, and in which the Dudley Boyz also competed. At Unforgiven, the Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a steel cage match to win the title for a second time. They re-lost the title to Edge and Christian (who were dressed as Los Conquistadores) at No Mercy, but they won it back the next night on Raw Is War for a third time. During the match, the Hardy Boyz were dressed as Los Conquistadores, but tore off their masks after the match, revealing themselves. The team lost the title less than a month later to Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) on the November 6 episode of Raw Is War, when Edge and Christian came out and assaulted the Hardyz, allowing Right to Censor to pick up the win and the title.

The Hardyz became involved in a feud with both Edge and Christian and Right to Censor. At Survivor Series, the Hardyz along with the Dudleyz defeated Edge and Christian and Right to Censor in a Survivor Series elimination match. At Rebellion, the Hardy Boyz faced Right to Censor in a rematch for the titles but were unable to win the titles when Val Venis interfered. On the December 4 episode of Raw Is War, Dean Malenko defeated the Hardy Boyz' valet Lita to retain the Light Heavyweight Championship and earn himself a date with her three days later on SmackDown!, when Malenko took Lita on a date and received a beating from the Hardyz. The Hardyz began feuding with Malenko and his friends, The Radicalz (Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Malenko and Perry Saturn). The two teams faced each other in several tag team and singles matches on Raw Is War and SmackDown!. The two teams also squared off against each other at Armageddon with Guerrero, Malenko and Saturn taking on the Hardyz and Lita. The Radicalz won the match.

On the March 5, 2001 episode of Raw Is War, the Hardy Boyz captured their fourth WWF Tag Team Championship when they defeated The Dudley Boyz, after interference from Christian, only to lose the title to Edge and Christian two weeks later on Raw. The next month at WrestleMania X-Seven, the Hardy Boyz competed in another TLC match against Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz. Just as in the first TLC match, Edge and Christian were victorious thanks to help from Rhyno.

On the October 8 episode of Raw, the Hardy Boyz won the WCW Tag Team Championship from Booker T and Test. They lost the title to the Dudley Boyz two weeks later on SmackDown!. On the November 12 episode of Raw, they beat Booker T and Test again, but this time for the WWF Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, they lost the title to the Dudleys in a steel cage title unification match. This defeat led to a break up storyline that resulted in a match between the brothers at Vengeance. Jeff would emerge victorious after Lita, who was the special referee, failed to see Matt's foot on the rope. The storyline was dropped in January 2002 and they reunited.

At No Way Out, the Hardy Boyz participated in a tag team turmoil match which was won by the APA. At WrestleMania X8, along with the APA and the Dudley Boyz, the Hardyz challenged Billy and Chuck for the WWF Tag Team Championship in a four corners elimination match. The APA were eliminated by the Dudleyz, whom the Hardy Boyz managed to eliminate. In the end, they were pinned by the champions, therefore losing the opportunity. They then began a feud with the newcomer Brock Lesnar and his manager Paul Heyman. At Judgment Day, the Hardy Boyz lost to Lesnar and Heyman in a tag team match.

Split and departure (2002–2005) 
The duo split up afterward as Jeff began a storyline with The Undertaker, while Matt was relegated to working on Heat. In the storyline, Matt then attacked Jeff due to jealousy of Jeff getting opportunities, including a match for the Intercontinental Championship. Matt was then moved to the SmackDown! brand, where he dubbed himself ""Matt Hardy Version 1"" and the ""Sensei of Mattitude"" and picked up real-life friend Shannon Moore and briefly Crash Holly as followers. He later won the Cruiserweight Championship from Billy Kidman at No Way Out in February 2003. Jeff was released from WWE on April 22 for erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab and deteriorating ring performance as well as constant tardiness and no-showing events.

Following his release from WWE, Jeff debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in mid-2004. After no-showing several events, he was suspended in 2006 before leaving the company soon afterward. Meanwhile, in April 2005, Matt was released from WWE due to unprofessional conduct with social media after discovering Lita had a real-life affair with Edge. He was rehired just a few months later, feuded with Edge, and was eventually sent to the SmackDown! brand.

The Hardys reunion (2006–2007) 

On August 4, 2006, Jeff rejoined WWE on its Raw brand. In November 2006, it was announced on WWE's official website that Matt and Jeff would team up for the first time together in over four years as members of Team DX at the Survivor Series. The Hardys, as they were now known, were first given a ""warm up match"" on ECW on Sci Fi, defeating The Full Blooded Italians (Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke). At Survivor Series, Team DX defeated Team Rated-RKO in a clean sweep.

On the November 27 episode of Raw, The Hardys had their first shot at Tag Team gold in five years. They took on World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), but came up short when Edge hit Jeff in the back with a belt to get himself and Orton deliberately disqualified to retain the title. That same day, The Hardys posed an open challenge to any team for ECW brand's ECW December to Dismember which was immediately accepted by a reuniting MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). After a run in on the intervening ECW on Sci Fi, The Hardys defeated MNM at the event, starting a feud between all four men that spanned both brands. The Hardys got their first chance to gain the WWE Tag Team Championship at Armageddon, where the original tag team match was changed to a four team ladder match involving The Hardys, MNM, Dave Taylor and William Regal, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Despite coming up short, The Hardys sparked another feud with MNM when Mercury was legitimately injured. While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, Matt and Mercury feuded on SmackDown!. Mercury and Nitro tried injuring both Hardys' faces as payback for what happened at Armageddon, claiming that The Hardys had ruined Mercury's 'Hollywood good looks'. The Hardys settled their feud with MNM at the Royal Rumble when they defeated them for the second time. Matt and Mercury continued feuding, however, which was finally settled at No Way Out.

On the April 2, 2007, episode of Raw, the Hardys won the World Tag Team Championship for the sixth time in their career after winning a ten team battle royal. After losing singles bouts to both Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, The Hardys retained their World Tag Team Championship at both Backlash and Judgment Day against the team of Cade and Murdoch. At One Night Stand, Hardyz retained the titles against The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) in a ladder match. The next night on Raw, however, the Hardys lost their championship to Cade and Murdoch, when Jeff missed a Swanton Bomb and was pinned by Cade after Murdoch pushed his foot off of the bottom rope of the ring. Cade and Murdoch attacked the Hardys with the championship belts after the match. The Hardys got a rematch at Vengeance, but was unsuccessful after Jeff was hit with a sitout spinebuster from Cade.

The Hardys once again returned to WWE on the November 13 episode of ECW to face Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mr. Kennedy, a match that was originally scheduled for the November 16 episode of SmackDown!. The Hardys were unsuccessful in their return as Porter pinned Jeff for the win. The Hardys, announced and referred to once again as the Hardy Boyz, reunited once again in 2008, on the June 23 episode of Raw in a losing effort to John Morrison and The Miz. The match occurred after Jeff was drafted to the SmackDown brand (the same brand as Matt). This loss, however, caused Matt to be drafted to the ECW brand. On the July 15 episode of ECW, The Hardys reunited in their home state of North Carolina, defeating Morrison and Miz. The Hardys then teamed up on the October 31 episode of SmackDown and on November 3 on Raw, winning both matches.

Feud and second departure (2009) 

The Hardy Boyz kickstarted 2009 with a win over Edge and Big Show on the January 2 episode of SmackDown. This was the last match for the then WWE Champion and ECW Champion as a team as Matt would lose the ECW championship to Jack Swagger on the January 13 episode of ECW. Heading into the 2009 Royal Rumble, Matt was attempting to regain the ECW Championship from Jack Swagger while Jeff held the WWE Championship. After Matt lost to Swagger, he interfered in Jeff's match with Edge, hitting Jeff with a steel chair and allowing Edge to win the WWE Championship. On the January 30 episode of SmackDown, Matt announced the permanent disbandment of the tag team due to the events at the Royal Rumble and that he no longer considered Jeff as his partner or brother. Matt moved to the SmackDown brand and began a scripted rivalry with Jeff. The pair faced each other in an Extreme Rules match at WrestleMania 25, which Matt won. They later faced each other in a stretcher match, in which Matt gained his second win over Jeff. As part of the 2009 WWE draft, Matt was drafted to the Raw brand on the April 13 episode of Raw. Despite this, the brothers faced each other in an ""I Quit"" match at Backlash, which Jeff won. Matt also interfered in Jeff's World Heavyweight Championship match at Judgment Day, preventing him from winning the championship.

On the August 21 episode of SmackDown, Jeff (then the World Heavyweight Champion) and Matt reunited as the Hardys and teamed with John Morrison in a six-man tag team match to defeat CM Punk and The Hart Dynasty. The following week, Jeff lost a ""Loser Leaves the WWE"" steel cage match to CM Punk, resulting in him leaving the company. Over a year later, on October 15, 2010, WWE announced that Matt had been released from his contract, with Matt later stating that his release had been in effect two weeks before WWE made the announcement.

Total Nonstop Action Wrestling

Immortal (2010–2011) 

Jeff made his TNA return on the January 4, 2010 episode of Impact!, and went on to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory in October with help from Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, revealing that they and others had formed the Immortal faction. On January 9, 2011, at TNA's pay-per-view Genesis, Matt made his TNA debut as a surprise member of Immortal, and defeated Rob Van Dam. Jeff went on to lose the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson later that night. On the January 13 episode of Impact! the Hardy Brothers reunited, as heels for the first time since 1999, and defeated Van Dam and Anderson. Following the Victory Road pay-per-view, Immortal severed their ties with Jeff. On August 20, Matt was released from TNA after being arrested for driving while intoxicated.

TNA World Tag Team Champions (2014–2015) 
Matt returned to TNA in mid-2014. On June 26, at Destination X The Hardys unsuccessfully challenged The Wolves (Davey Richards and Eddie Edwards) for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the August 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys were defeated by Team 3D (the former Dudley Boyz). At the Hardcore Justice edition of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D challenged The Wolves to a three-way for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, to which they agreed. Kurt Angle later announced that all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the title with the winners of the first match being able to choose the stipulation of the next one. Team 3D won the first match and chose a Tables match, The Hardys won the second match and chose a ladder match, and The Wolves won the third match on the No Surrender episode of Impact Wrestling, tying them all at one win each. A final match to decide the series took place, and was won by The Wolves. In October, The Hardys participated in a tournament to determine the number one contender to the TNA World Tag Team Championship; they defeated The BroMans (Jessie Godderz and DJ Z), Ethan Carter III and Tyrus, and Samoa Joe and Low Ki to win the tournamanet. On February 6, 2015, at Lockdown, The Hardys unsuccessfully challenged The Revolution for the TNA World Tag Team Championship in a Six Sides of Steel match.

After The Wolves vacated the tag team championship due to an injury to Eddie Edwards, an Ultimate X match was held for the title at the March 16 Impact Wrestling tapings. The Hardys defeated Kenny King and Low Ki, Ethan Carter III and Bram, and Rockstar Spud and Mr. Anderson to win the match and the title. However, The Hardys vacated the titles due to Jeff's broken tibia.

The Broken Hardyz (2016–2017) 

On the August 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, after a lengthy feud involving the ""Deletion"" of Jeff Hardy, Broken Matt sent Jeff,  (at the time referred to as Brother Nero), on a quest to procure the Impact Wrestling World Tag Team Championship for him. On the August 18 episode of Impact Wrestling, Broken Matt and Brother Nero defeated The BroMans, The Tribunal, and The Helms Dynasty in an ""Ascension to Hell"" fatal four-way number one contender's ladder match for an opportunity to challenge Decay for the TNA World Tag Team Championships at Bound for Glory. Broken Matt climbed the ladder and grabbed the contract, following Nero sacrificing himself by jumping off the ladder and onto Trevor Lee. On the September 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, the Hardys invited Decay to come to their hometown compound, plotting for a sequel to ""The Final Deletion"" (dubbed as ""Delete or Decay""). Broken Matt turned babyface during this encounter when King Maxel was almost kidnapped by Decay and when Brother Nero took a hit from Abyss' spiked bat, and Broken Matt healed him via the Lake of Restoration.

On October 2 at TNA Bound for Glory they defeated Decay to become two time TNA World Tag Team Champions. On the October 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, they retained their titles against Decay in a Wolf Creek match. On the October 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, they were attacked by The Tribunal. The Hardys would then face The Tribunal one week later, on October 20's broadcast where they were able to successfully defend their titles. However, after the match as they returned to the dressing-rooms, the arena went dark, signalling the arrival of a new faction, dubbed the DCC. The DCC would use the darkness to attack and layout The Tribunal as The Hardys looked on from the ramp, thus potentially building an upcoming rivalry in weeks to comes. On February 27, 2017, The Hardys announced their departure from TNA after negotiations of a new contract fell through. Jeff and Matt left the company without dropping the TNA World Tag Team Championships.

Expedition of Gold (2014–2017) 
Beginning in April 2014, the brothers reunited on the independent circuit.

In 2017, the Hardys embarked on a tour of various independent promotions—while still reigning as TNA World Tag Team Champions—which was promoted on Impact Wrestling as the ""Expedition of Gold,"" where they sought to win other tag team titles in order to declare themselves as the ""greatest tag team in all of space and time"". During this tour, Matt and Jeff won the tag team titles in promotions such as Mexico's The Crash promotion, the West Virginia based All Star Wrestling, Maryland's MCW Pro Wrestling, their own OMEGA Championship Wrestling and Wrestling Superstar company based out of Chile. Footage from some of these matches was aired on Impact Wrestling.

Although some debate remains whether it was six or seven championships held at one time, the contracts of Broken Matt (Hardy) and Brother Nero (Jeff Hardy) expired with TNA Wrestling on February 27, 2017 at midnight after negotiations were stalled by the company. Having previously filmed television weeks in advance, in storylines Matt and Jeff remained the TNA Tag Team Champions as their contracts expired. They offered to drop the titles the following week on the next set of television tapings but TNA's new parent company, Anthem, declined.

On March 4, 2017, The Hardys made their Ring of Honor (ROH) debut at Manhattan Mayhem VI and defeated The Young Bucks for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. TNA still recognized them as the World Tag Team Champions (as the footage filmed for the following week where they would vacate the titles on Impact Wrestling hadn't aired yet), making them the only team to be recognized as both the TNA and ROH World Tag Team Champions simultaneously. They then lost the titles back to The Young Bucks in a ladder match on April 1 at Supercard of Honor XI, to which after the match, Jeff was noted as staying in the ring and saying ""We'll fade away and classify ourselves as obsolete"", paying homage to their ""Broken"" characters. It was also announced after the match that both Matt and Jeff Hardy's contracts had expired.

Having won the ROH World Tag Team Championship, their tag team title accouterments equaled seven at the time. The Broken Hardy storyline was abruptly dropped without explanation following a new set of television tapings between March 2–5, 2017. The Hardys did not appear on the Thursday, March 9 airing of Impact Wrestling and there was no reference to the TNA tag team titles, but the Broken Hardys were last seen broadcast in their compound using Vanguard-1 to teleport them with the TNA World Tag Team Championship belts to their next location, only for Decay to appear through teleportation with the belts with Rosemary declaring the Broken Hardys, ""deleted, obsolete, and decay!"". The following week on the March 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, Bruce Prichard cut a promo in the ring and said that the tag team titles are won in the ring, not in space. Playing upon the Hardys phrase of ""greatest tag team in all of space and time"", he said that four teams would wrestle in two weeks to crown new tag team champions.

Return to WWE (2017, 2019) 

On April 2 at, WrestleMania 33, The Hardy Boyz made an unannounced return to WWE, after hosts The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) announced that the triple threat ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship which had been set by WWE before the event was now going to be a Fatal four-way match. They then began jokingly questioning the arena about who the mystery team could be, before the Hardy Boyz's made their entrance to the stage to a massive ovation from the crowd. At the event, The Hardy Boyz won the Raw Tag Team Championship, defeating the teams of Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Cesaro and Sheamus, and then-reigning champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. The night after WrestleMania on Raw, they successfully defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Afterwards on Raw Talk, Matt mentioned that the Hardy Boyz had successfully completed the Expedition of Gold after winning the Raw Tag Team Championship. They would retain the titles at Payback against Sheamus and Cesaro, but lost them at Extreme Rules in a steel cage match, and failed to regain it at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event.

In September, Jeff suffered a torn rotator cuff and would be out of action for four to six months, leaving Matt to begin a run as a singles competitor. However, two years later, on the February 26, 2019 episode of SmackDown Live, the Hardy Boyz reunited and, on the April 9 episode of SmackDown, defeated The Usos to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championships. With this, they became the first team to win all three of WWE's world tag team championships (World, Raw, and SmackDown). However, they vacated the WWE Smackdown Tag Team Championships due to Jeff suffering a leg injury from Lars Sullivan. While Jeff was recovering, Matt was featured less on WWE television until he left WWE on March 2. and he went on to sign with All Elite Wrestling. Jeff went on to become a singles competitor before being released from the WWE on December 9, 2021.  On February 14, 2022, The Hardys announced that they will go on their final run.

Reunion (2022) 
Matt announced on Twitter that he and Jeff would be reuniting for their 'Final Run' and wrestling a match in Big Time Wrestling (BTW). They will be facing the winner of a match between The Briscoes and The S.A.T.

Other media 
The Hardys appeared on the February 7, 1999 episode of That '70s Show entitled ""That Wrestling Show"", as uncredited wrestlers. Jeff and Matt, along with Lita, also appeared on Tough Enough in early 2001, talking and wrestling with the contestants. They both appeared on the February 25, 2002 episode of Fear Factor competing against four other WWF wrestlers. Jeff was eliminated in the first round, but Matt became the eventual winner, winning $50,000 for the American Cancer Society.

In 2001, the Hardys and Lita appeared in Rolling Stone magazine's 2001 Sports Hall of Fame issue. In 2003, Jeff and Matt, with the help of Michael Krugman, wrote and published their autobiography The Hardy Boyz: Exist 2 Inspire. As part of WWE, the Hardys appeared in the DVD, The Hardy Boyz: Leap of Faith in 2001. On April 29, 2008, WWE released Twist of Fate: The Matt and Jeff Hardy Story. The DVD features footage of the brothers in OMEGA and WWE, and it also briefly mentions Jeff's initial stint in TNA. The brothers also appear on The Hardy Show, an internet web show which features the Hardys, Shannon Moore, and many of their friends.

Reception
Ikogosi was panned by critics. Ada of Nollywood Reinvented gives the film 2 out of 5 stars, praising the set design, music and costumes, but criticizes the story and screenplay, the actors' performances, and directing. She concludes: ""Though there are enough stories about relationships and marriage that definitely need to be told, they have been done so many times. There's a need to make movies around such topics that add more dimension and tell the stories in different and unexpected ways. There were enough dimensions to the plot of Ikogosi to develop and the resolutions definitely deserved more set up. I would not advise committing time to watching this movie unless you are bored. Completely bored"". Adenike Adebayo heavily criticized the purpose of the film and rated it 1 out of 5 stars.

Route description

NC 294 is a two-lane mountain rural highway that is wholly in the Nantahala National Forest. From its western terminus at the Tennessee state line, it connects the communities of Liberty, Suit and Letitia to its eastern terminus at U.S. Route 64 (US 64) and US 74. It also goes by Fields of the Wood, a bible park, and access to the Hiwassee Dam.

History
Established in 1931 as a new primary routing, NC 294 traveled from NC 28 (today US 64/US 74), through Postell, to the Tennessee state line. In 1932, it was extended east by overlapping with US 64/NC 28 then southwest on new primary routing to the Georgia state line, towards Blue Ridge. In 1934, NC 294 eastern terminus was truncated back to its original and current location; its newer segment renumbered to NC 60. In 1942, NC 294 was rerouted north onto upgraded existing and new construction, bypassing Postell on Candy Mountain Road (SR 1150).

Transportation in Cherokee County, North CarolinaSickle-gloss, or sickle sheen, is a silica residue found on blades such as sickles and scythes suggesting that they have been used to cut the silica-rich stems of cereals and forming an indirect proof for incipient agriculture. The gloss occurs from the abrasive action of silica in both wild and cultivated stems of cereal grasses, meaning the occurrence of reaping tools with sickle gloss doesn't necessarily imply agriculture. The first documented appearance of sickle-gloss is found on flint knapped blades in the Natufian culture (12,500 to 9500 BC) in the Middle East, primarily in Israel.

How sickle-gloss forms 
Sickle-gloss has been recognized as a characteristic of reaping grasses since the 1930s, at least. There is a general consensus that sickle-gloss occurs after the reaping of grasses and it may form in as little as a few hours of work. However, it may require more time to accumulate enough sickle-gloss for archaeological preservation. It is also speculated that the gloss may accumulate from cutting canes or reeds, woodworking or perhaps even hoeing or digging. It may be possible to distinguish between different types of glosses on a macro or microscopic level.

Gloss lines 
Direction of the gloss lines are relative to the work edge of a sickle. Gloss lines rarely penetrate more than 5 mm on the face of the segment. Later period sickles were more likely to show gloss patterns that were parallel or near parallel to working edges.

Importance of context 
At sites with sickle-gloss, it is reasonable to assume that there were sickles used for varying lengths of time. Sickles that lack gloss may be assumed to be unused or unfinished (since flint sickles only require a few hours to accumulate sickle-gloss.)

Controversy 
According to Lithics After the Stone Age: A Handbook of Stone Tools from the Levant, there is much debate over the actual formation of sickle-gloss, focusing on whether the gloss results from abrasive polishing of silica in the flint artifact or whether a silica coating is added from silica in the grasses that are harvested. According to ""Cutting Graminae Tools and 'Sickle Gloss' Formation"", there are at least four main concepts that have been invoked to try to explain the origins of sickle-gloss:
 Gloss is a result from working with plant materials in which the tool used forms a silica gel. Small plant fragments are incorporated in the gel.
 Gloss is also a result of working with plant materials in which the tool used forms a silica gel. However, the plant material is separate from the gel.
 There is a purely mechanical or chemical and mechanical character to the sickle gloss.
 Sickle gloss forms as a result of many different factors and tries to include the aforementioned ideas.

There is also debate on the meaning of the sickle-gloss, especially in understanding the rise of agriculture and the use of sickles as indicators of reaping grasses in Epipaleolithic and early Neolithic societies. This problem doesn't apply in late Neolithic societies because of their documentation of the use of sickles for agriculture.

County-level divisions of Shanxi""HumancentiPad"", stylized as ""HUMANCENTiPAD"", is the first episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 210th episode of the series overall. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 27, 2011. In the episode, Kyle is kidnapped after agreeing to an iTunes user agreement, and forced to become part of a ""revolutionary new product"" that is about to be launched by Apple. Meanwhile, Cartman, who has not acquired an Apple iPad, pesters his mother on the issue, drawing her ire.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA-L in the United States. The episode's title, and main plot, refers to the 2009 film The Human Centipede (First Sequence). This episode parodies reports about tracking software built into Apple's iPads and iPhones, and also the tediously long end-user license agreements.

The making of the episode was the subject of the TV special, 6 Days to Air, which aired on Comedy Central on October 9, 2011.

Plot
After fourth grader Eric Cartman boasts to his classmates of owning an iPad, and mocks them for not having one, he is humiliated when it is revealed that he actually does not own one. When he and his mother Liane go to Best Buy to buy an iPad, the item's exorbitant price prompts her to suggest buying a less expensive Toshiba HandiBook. The demanding Cartman, who had his mind set on the iPad as a status symbol, loudly excoriates her in the middle of the store, accusing her of ""fucking"" him. The embarrassed Liane decides to leave the store without buying Eric anything.

Meanwhile, Cartman's classmate and frequent nemesis Kyle Broflovski, who did not read the Terms and Conditions when agreeing to download the latest iTunes update, is pursued by shadowy agents from Apple Inc., who wish to perform a number of intrusive acts upon him, informing him that he agreed to them when he downloaded the update. Kyle attempts to flee the men, and is incredulous when his friends inform him that they all read the entire Terms and Conditions when they downloaded the latest update. Kyle seeks refuge at his father  Gerald's law office, but the Apple agents taser his father, kidnap Kyle, and throw him in a cage with a Japanese man and a young woman who also failed to read the fine print of their purchased updates.

At a Stevenote address, Steve Jobs unveils the new product for which Kyle and the other two were kidnapped: the HUMANCENTiPAD, comprising the three kidnapped subjects on all fours and sewn together mouth to anus. The Japanese man is in front, with an iPhone attached to his forehead; Kyle is in the middle; and the woman is at the rear, with an iPad attached to her anus. However, Jobs is disappointed when Kyle continues to sign agreements that are put in front of him without reading them first, and puts the ""device"" through tests in an attempt to make it read. 

Meanwhile, Cartman appears on the talk show Dr. Phil to publicly accuse Liane of ""fucking"" him. The audience misunderstands this to mean that she has sexually molested him. As a consolation gift, Cartman is given the first ever HUMANCENTiPAD as Jobs unveils it to the public. Cartman is elated to have a device that not only supports web browsing and email, but also enables him to induce someone to defecate into Kyle's mouth.

Seeking to free his son, Gerald goes with Kyle's friends to an Apple Store, where the customer service agents known as ""the Geniuses"", after considerable deliberations, determine that they can void Kyle's agreement if Gerald, a PC user, signs up with Apple and creates a family account. Gerald consents, after which he, the Geniuses and Kyle's friends go to the studio where Dr. Phil is produced. Jobs, complying with Gerald's new deal, reluctantly makes preparations to have Kyle separated from his two fellow victims. This enrages Cartman, whose dream is now being quashed. Cartman looks up to the heavens and angrily excoriates God, after which he is struck by a bolt of lightning. He is then shown recuperating in a hospital bed, crying while his mother flips through a book indifferently.

Reception
In its original American broadcast on April 27, 2011, ""HUMANCENTiPAD"" was watched by 3.108 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.

Reviewing the episode for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker called the episode ""scabrously funny"" and summed up its message as ""[k]nowledge really matters; many people are lazy and consequently become prey to exploitation"". Ramsey Iser of IGN rated the episode 7.5 out of 10. He said the episode was ""a decent opening"" for the season, but criticized it for overuse of Cartman's accusations against his mother, generic jokes about Apple's ""Geniuses"", and ""poop jokes ... [that] didn't do much for the story or the comedy"".

People from Narayanganj DistrictMarv is a fictional character in the graphic novel series Sin City, created by Frank Miller. In the 2005 film adaptation and its 2014 sequel, he is played by Mickey Rourke. He first appears in The Hard Goodbye and follows with appearances in A Dame to Kill For, Just Another Saturday Night, and Silent Night.  He makes a brief cameo in Blue Eyes (as featured in Lost, Lonely, and Lethal).

Marv has been well received both as a comic book character and a film character.

Appearances in the Sin City series
Marv is one of the major characters of the series, and appears or is mentioned in nearly every book. He is the protagonist of the first Sin City ""yarn"", The Hard Goodbye, as well as two shorter installments, Silent Night and Just Another Saturday Night. He also has a supporting role in A Dame to Kill For.

The Hard Goodbye
The Hard Goodbye begins as Marv has sex with a beautiful blonde prostitute named Goldie, only to wake up to find her dead and himself framed for her murder. He escapes from the cops and vows that he will avenge Goldie's death, killing his way through a chain of small-time thugs before learning the identity of Goldie's killer to be a mute and cannibalistic serial killer named Kevin. Kevin is the ward of Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark, and is thus under the protection of the powerful Roark family.

Marv finds Kevin, but is knocked out and finds himself in Kevin's basement, which is decorated with the heads of prostitutes mounted on the mantle. Marv also discovers that his parole officer, Lucille, is Kevin's next intended victim; he has already eaten her hand. He escapes with Lucille, who is killed by a squad of Sin City police. Marv, hearing from Lucille that Goldie was a prostitute, heads off to Old Town for more information before being ambushed by Goldie's twin sister Wendy, who also believed that Marv killed her sister. Marv convinces Wendy of his innocence and reluctantly takes her along to the infamous Roark family farm to subdue Kevin. Knocking Wendy out so she would not witness what will occur next, Marv inflicts the most brutal form of death he can imagine: sawing off Kevin's legs and leaving him to be eaten by his own pet wolf. Marv then finds Cardinal Roark, who admits that he and Kevin had been killing and cannibalizing prostitutes together and that Kevin killed Goldie for knowing too much. Marv kills Roark in an unspecified (but presumably grisly) manner before the police burst in and shower Marv with bullets.

Marv survives, however, creating a problem for the Roark family and the corrupt police force as he possesses knowledge that would have the city implode. The police threaten to kill Marv's mother unless he confesses to the murders that Roark and Kevin committed; Marv agrees, but only after breaking an attorney's arm in three places. He has a steak and a beer for his last meal. He is sentenced to die in the electric chair. Before his execution, Wendy visits him one last time to thank him for everything he has done. Marv goes to the chair, but survives the first jolt, defiantly saying to his executioners: ""Is that the best you can do, you pansies?"" They have to pull the switch again to finish him off, announcing ""He's gone"".

A Dame to Kill For
In A Dame To Kill For (which is set just before The Hard Goodbye) Marv becomes a sidekick of sorts to his good friend Dwight McCarthy, agreeing to help him rescue his former lover Ava Lord. When it is revealed to be a set-up, he rushes a mortally wounded Dwight to Old Town, where he is taken in by his former 'associate' Gail. Shortly afterwards, Marv becomes involved with Goldie.

Silent Night
In Silent Night, Marv rescues a young girl from sexual torture. The story is told with almost no dialogue.

Just Another Saturday Night
In Just Another Saturday Night, Marv wakes up on the side of a highway, surrounded by dead men, and tries to piece together how he got there.

Physical appearance
Marv is depicted as an extremely imposing,  man with a flattop buzzcut, a falcon-like nose and a heavily scarred face, making him unappealing to the opposite sex. He has a massive frame and is distinctly broad-shouldered, generally towering over his fellow characters. He is usually seen dressed in an overcoat, white undershirt, leather pants and combat boots.

Personality
In the book Sin City: The Making of the Movie, creator Frank Miller describes the creation of Marv as a juxtaposition of his two biggest influences: film noir and medieval stories. The result was the idea for a character he called ""Conan in a trench coat.""

In the film Sin City his good friend Dwight remarks ""most people think Marv is crazy. He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century. He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield swinging an axe into somebody's face. Or in a Roman arena, taking his sword to other gladiators like him.""

Even for someone his size, Marv has an unusual level of speed which, coupled with his well developed fighting skills, incredible strength and pain tolerance, allow him to bring down nearly anyone who challenges him or breaks his personal code of ethics with startling ease. He notes with a measure of grudging respect in The Hard Goodbye that Kevin is the only person to ever successfully sneak up on him. Marv is also fond of long trench coats, and immediately prior to killing someone in possession of such a coat, he often remarks something to the effect of ""That's a damn fine coat you're wearing"", after which he takes their coat, especially if the one he had was damaged.

He suffers from an unnamed mental condition that causes him to ""get confused"", which, judging from his own awareness of his illness and the effects it is shown to have, probably involves short-term memory loss and possibly hallucinations. He also fears ""turn[ing] into what they always said [he] was gonna turn into- a maniac, a psycho killer."" Lucille, his parole officer, supplies him with medication (presumably antipsychotics) through her girlfriend Claire to control these effects of his condition. Claire, a psychiatrist, once tried to analyze him, but he claims she got ""too scared.""

Marv has convinced himself that he doesn't have a particularly high intellect, but he shows a surprising amount of intelligence when needed, noticeably an ability to logically deduce confusing and complex events quite accurately, sometimes based on scarce or conflicting information, and his skills in combat also imply a degree of intelligence from a tactical viewpoint. However, in most situations he just smashes his way through conflicts, such as kicking down a door and sending police flying, or charging a squad of heavily armed cops whilst only armed with a hatchet. In at least one instance, after being tied to a chair by Gail, who states that knots are her specialty, she and the rest of the girls of Old Town are startled to find out Marv was able to untie himself while being beaten by her, all without anyone in the room even noticing.

Marv has a well-developed skill and a strong appetite for torture. He never blinks, nor seems to think twice about inflicting the slowest, most creatively painful death he can possibly implement on his worst enemies. He often speaks in a soft, plain-spoken, calm, almost nonchalant demeanor, showing no sign of hesitation or fear, even while committing gruesome killings. Marv shows little to no fear in dangerous situations, even when heavily outnumbered, and faces them with a dry laconic humor. In The Hard Goodbye, instead of panicking when cornered by several members of the SWAT team, upon being asked to open the door, he lights up a cigarette and very calmly states ""I'll be right out."", before successfully fighting his way out of the building.

While Marv has no compunction about maiming and killing anyone he feels has wronged him or those close to him, even he has his limits. He is deeply afraid of winding up as ""a maniac [or] a psycho killer"" (as mentioned previously). Marv will only kill someone if, as he himself puts it, ""I know for sure I ought to."" He makes it a point to avoid unnecessarily hurting or killing those who have not earned it in his eyes, and also notes with some amusement that he enjoys confrontations with paid hitmen, since he never feels guilty about what he does to them. A perfect example of his resolve to avoid causing unnecessary harm is when he knocks out Wendy rather than let her watch him dismember Kevin; he believed Wendy witnessing Kevin's dismemberment would cause her a lifetime of nightmares, and would therefore be unnecessarily hurting her, a belief which also superseded his otherwise ironclad rule against hitting women. He also adheres unrelentingly to his own personal code of honor, which dictates the repayment of debts and chivalry towards women, stating that ""it really gets my goat when guys rough up dames"", even refusing to lay a finger on Gail, who wrongly believed he had killed several prostitutes under her employ, after she tied him to a chair and tortured him for information. He also highly values kindness, often going out of his way to repay kindness shown to him. As such, he will defend anyone whom he considers a friend or has shown him kindness until he is no longer capable, or he feels the debt has been repaid, whichever comes first. As a devout Catholic, Marv condones the violence and blood on his hands, both figurative and literal, as justice against those who would do evil in the world, even if Marv's personal brand of justice might fly in the face of Catholic teachings. It may be best paraphrased as ""It may be God's job to judge a man's evil deeds, but it Marv's job to arrange the meeting."" noting that some things in this world are, in Marv's own words, ""worth going to Hell for"".

Marv is shown to have a platonic relationship with Nancy, being a sort of guardian angel to her, especially after an incident in which ""some frat boyfriend of hers roughed her up"". Another platonic relationship is with his social worker, Lucille, who is a lesbian. While Marv has no objections to her being a homosexual, or to homosexuality in general, he simply cannot fathom why Lucille is a lesbian, stating ""that with a body like hers, she can have any man she wanted."" Marv also has a soft spot for children, suggested when he rescues a little girl from pimps in Silent Night, as well as for animals, as shown when he knocks out, rather than kills, Kevin's wolf, which he only does as a matter of necessity to maintain the element of surprise, since Kevin's wolf had otherwise done nothing to wrong him.  Throughout the story, Marv often shows a good-natured, humorous side, unresentful of even the worst that fate can throw at him and often showing a wry laconic sense of humor at the absurdity of his situations.

The one woman Marv loves above all others is his mother. His mother, who is blind, has a nigh-supernatural sense of hearing, and can hear Marv tip-toeing around the house, even when he is completely silent.  She dotes on her only son, keeping his room exactly as he left it when he moved out, and shows concern for him when people come looking for him.  He, in turn, treats her with great respect and is very protective of her, doing his best to keep her from harm or anyone who would even threaten to hurt her. For instance, when an assistant DA threatens her life after he refuses to sign a false confession, Marv signs it (after fracturing the assistant DA's arm in three places)

Movie appearance
Marv is played by Mickey Rourke in the first film adaptation; Rourke took to the role despite the heavy amount of make-up work required and the minimal use of sets and even other actors. Because of the speed at which the film was shot (and the fact that most of the cast who appeared in multiple stories hadn't yet been cast), several of the people Rourke is seen interacting with weren't necessarily there during the day it was shot. During the scenes at Kadie's, he never met or interacted with Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen or Jessica Alba, all of whom were yet to be cast or scheduled for filming; those scenes were all shot on different days several months later. Similarly, Rutger Hauer and Elijah Wood never met Rourke either. Hauer was one of the last people to be cast and his scene was shot months after The Hard Goodbye had finished principal photography. Wood and Rourke were shot fighting each other's respective stunt doubles.

He also makes a cameo appearance in the segment That Yellow Bastard at the same bar where John Hartigan goes to look for Nancy Callahan, just as featured in The Hard Goodbye.

Rourke reprises his role as Marv in the 2014 sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.

Rourke's portrayal of the character was very popular among audiences and critics, winning awards from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, Online Film Critics Society, Chicago Film Critics Association, and the Irish Film and Television Awards.  On the Sin City DVD, Frank Miller commented that ""After [the interview] with Rourke, I was only able to get down one note: 'He IS Marv!'""

Merchandising

In 1999, Marv's likeness was captured in the form of three McFarlane Toys action figures, all depicting scenes from ""The Hard Goodbye.""  One comes with Kevin's severed head and a gun, while another figure was made with bandages on his face. The latter also comes in black and white and a gun, while the other, known as ""Death Row Marv"", comes with an electric chair.

Death Row Marv was comparably rare to most other action figures on the market, as it was offered exclusively to comic book specialty stores and was not made available to larger chains such as Toys R Us and Walmart.  Despite the fact that this was a collectible marketed solely towards adults, it caused a considerable amount of controversy.

In 2005, the license for Sin City toys has been acquired by NECA, who has also done their own versions of ""Death Row Marv"".

In 2007, Marv was announced to be in the second series of Marvel Toys' Legendary comic book heroes action figure line. Shortly afterward, another company, Dynamic Forces announced a full series of Sin City comic figures, which will start with a repaint of the Marvel Toys Marv figure.

In popular culture
In 2006, French country troubadour Steffan Rock recorded a song called ""The Return of Marv"", which is a tribute to both the character and Mickey Rourke.

Marv and the film adaptation of Sin City was parodied in the Robot Chicken episode ""Bionic Cow"". Marv is portrayed as a gruff, mean-spirited protector of cats and grandmas in ""Virtue City"". He was voiced by Hugh Davidson.

Reception
Marv has been well received both as a comic book character and a film character. Marv was ranked as the 24th greatest comic book character in Wizard magazine. Empire magazine also ranked Marv as the 26th greatest comic book character of all time writing that ""Marv is a grade A patsy, the fall guy, the hapless hero at the center of a conspiracy that he can't even begin to understand but with a traditional Miller tweak... [he is] a force of nature, cutting a path through the corrupt power-brokers of the city, until his pound of flesh (and more) has been exacted."" Also in 2008, Empire Magazine ranked Marv as the 82nd greatest film characters: ""He ain't too bright, but it turns out that Marv, despite his seemingly indestructible (if bandage-swathed) exterior, has a soft center."" IGN also listed Marv as the 75th greatest comic book hero of all time, writing that ""Sin City is a place where only the strong and sadistic can survive. Marv is a little of both, but he also has a noble streak and an unbreakable sense of loyalty towards those few people who can see beneath his craggy exterior and recognize the good man within.""

It was held on 15 September. Ten cyclists competed. Four had already competed in the sprint event. The result of the race proved Louis Bastien of France to be the top long-distance cyclist present, while Louis Hildebrand finished in second and Auguste Daumain in third. One of the contestants, Louis Trousselier, would go on to win the 1905 Tour de France. Prizes were awarded to the top four finishers: art objects valued at 400 francs (for first place), 300 francs (for second), 200 francs (third), and 100 francs (fourth).

Background

From 1896 to 1924 (excluding 1912, when no track events were held), the track cycling programme included events at a variety of distances that changed from Games to Games and ranged from the -mile to the 100 kilometres (and, even longer, the unique 12 hours race in 1896 that saw finishers exceed 300 kilometres). The 25 kilometres was held only in 1900. Louis Bastien was the favorite, having won the 100 kilometres world championship, with John Henry Lake (the sprint bronze medalist) and Louis Hildebrand also expected to do well.

Competition format

As the name suggests, the race was 25 kilometres in length. The track was 500 metres in length, so there were 50 laps. A single race was held.

Schedule

Results

Bastien took the lead early. Lake and Hildebrand were close behind, until Lake dropped out. Bertrand was 3 laps behind.

It is organised into a fibronectin III module domain-like fold, comprising only beta strands. Its function is not known, but it may be involved in interaction with the enzyme substrate, chitin. It is separated by a hinge region from the catalytic domain; this hinge region is probably mobile, allowing the N-terminal domain to have different relative positions in solution.

The piece examines the comic strip Nancy, focusing on Bushmiller’s use of the comics language to deliver a gag. Finding correspondences to the minimalist architecture of Mies Van Der Rohe, the essay calls Nancy ""a complex amalgam of formal rules laid out by [its] designer.""

Deconstruction
""How to Read Nancy"" is distinguished by its extensive analysis of a single Nancy comic strip originally published on August 8, 1959. The essay successively isolates and discusses the strip's individual formal elements (including the placement of word balloons, the level of the horizon line, the spotting of blacks, and panel shape and size) to demonstrate each codependent aspect of comics syntax. The essay has been used in a variety of university level courses about comics; a full 25% of syllabi listed on the National Association of Comics Arts Educators (NACAE) website include the essay in their required reading.

""How to Read Nancy"" is an outgrowth of Karasik and Newgarden’s lifelong interest in Bushmiller’s work. Newgarden had previously drawn ""Love’s Savage Fury,"" a four-page tribute to Nancy originally published in RAW Magazine v. 1 #8 in 1986 (also republished in The Best of Ernie Bushmiller’s Nancy), and the pair had assigned a Nancy-related assignment to students in a ""Language of Comics"" class that they co-taught in the 1980s at the School of Visual Arts in New York. One example of student work from that class, cartoonist R. Sikoryak’s ""Ancy,"" was later published in Legal Action Comics v. 1.

Book
The original ""How to Read Nancy"" essay is available as a PDF download from Newgarden’s website. Karasik and Newgarden have expanded the essay to book length, released on October 31, 2017, published by Fantagraphics Books as a companion to their multi-volume Nancy reprint series. The book won an Eisner Award in 2018 for ""Best Comics Related Book"".

2017 booksCITE-FM-1 is a French-language radio station located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

Owned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts on 102.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 92,000 watts (class C1) using an omnidirectional antenna on Mount Orford. This gives the station an impressive coverage area, as far west as Montreal, and as far south as St. Johnsbury, Vermont and Littleton, New Hampshire. However, it suffers from severe deficiencies in downtown Sherbrooke, most likely due to tall buildings blocking its signal in some areas. As a result, the station also operates a low-power relay in Sherbrooke, CITE-FM-2, which broadcasts on 94.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50 watts, also using an omnidirectional antenna.

The station has an adult contemporary format, and is part of the ""Rouge FM"" (formerly ""RockDétente"") network which operates across Quebec and Eastern Ontario.

Although the station's call sign suggests it is a relay of CITE-FM in Montreal, it is not actually a relay and programs from Montreal are not more common than on other Rouge FM stations (which have independent call signs). The reason for this irregular call sign is unclear. There is no known record among CRTC decisions suggesting that CITE-FM-1 was ever a full-time relay of CITE-FM in Montreal, or that the proportion of programming coming from Montreal was ever higher than for other Rouge FM stations. However, the station's signal reaches into the Montreal area, and anecdotal observations suggest that a modest but still noticeable number of Montreal-area listeners listen to it rather than CITE-FM. Since it is highly plausible that some of these listeners report ambiguously their listening in BBM diaries, as a result their listening to the Sherbrooke station would be assigned as per BBM rules to the Montreal station, which may explain the Sherbrooke station's unusual call sign.

CITE-FM-1 started as CHLT-FM in 1960, as it was created as a sister station to CHLT AM (now known as CKOY-FM, which previously used the CHLT-FM calls after its move from AM to FM), also in Sherbrooke. Since early 2005, they are no longer sister stations, as CKOY-FM is now owned by Cogeco. CITE-FM-1 was briefly known as CITE-FM in 1977, just before CITE-FM in Montreal started to broadcast.

On August 28, 1976, CHLT-FM became CITE-FM.

On August 18, 2011, at 4:00 p.m. EDT, all ""RockDétente"" stations, including CITE-FM-1, rebranded as Rouge FM. The last song under ""RockDétente"" was Pour que tu m'aimes encore by Celine Dion, followed by a tribute of the branding. The first song under ""Rouge"" was I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas.

 A character in comic book series Scott PilgrimSyriac Orthodox Monastery of Saint Mark is a Syriac Orthodox monastery and church in The Old City Of Jerusalem. According to a 6th-century inscription that was found at the Monastery of St Mark's in Jerusalem during a restoration in 1940, the church is built on the ancient site of the house of Mary, mother of St. Mark the Evangelist () and the place of the Last Supper of Christ with His disciples. Some Christians believe that the Last Supper was held at the nearby Cenacle on Mount Zion.

Inscription
""This is the house of Mary, mother of John, called Mark. Proclaimed a church by the holy apostles under the name of the Virgin Mary, mother of God, after the ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven. Renewed after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in the year A.D. 73.""

History
There is a large collection of manuscripts written by various Holy fathers of Christianity like that of, Mor Kurillos, Patriarch of Alexandria who presided over the third Universal Synod of Christianity held at Ephesus in AD 431; Mor Severious, Patriarch of Antioch (A.D 538);  Mor Gregorios Bar Ebroyo Maphriyono of the East (13th century);  Mor Dionysius;  Mor Chrysostom (4th century);  Mor Aphrem (AD 378); Mor Kuriakose, Patriarch of Antioch (AD 817); Mor Michael Rabo, Patriarch of Antioch (AD 1199) and others, in the monastery's famous library.

A piece of Holy Cross in which Lord Christ was crucified and relics of many Saints are preserved in this Monastery. Mary's baptismal basin, and an image of Virgin Mary painted by the apostle St. Luke can also be viewed in the Church.

History records that the site was visited by many ancient pilgrims from the West as well as the East, including the Bordeaux Pilgrim in 333 A.D., St. Cyril of Jerusalem in 348 A.D., and Saint Sylvia of Aquitaine in 385 A.D.

This is the center of the Syrian Orthodox (Syriac) community, which was established by the apostle St. Peter.  In the 6th century the community was persecuted and its leadership was later reestablished by Jacob Baradaeus; for this reason they are also known as “Jacobites.” After the Syriac Orthodox Church lost its other churches and properties in the Holy City, St. Mark's became the seat of the Archbishop of Jerusalem. The first known bishop to have lived there is Ignatius III in the year 1471. The monastery was rebuilt a few times, once by Metropolitan Gregorius Shem`un in 1718 and again by `Abdel Ahad Ben Fenah of Mardin in 1719 who also took care of restoring the manuscripts in the monastery's famous library. During the following century the monastery was restored at least five times, the last in 1858 after which it was left intact.

St. Mark’s monastery was rebuilt a few times: in 6th century AD,  1009, 1718, 1791, 1833, 1858, and in 1940.

Municipalities in Santa Catarina (state)Brett Bulmer (born April 26, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He is currently playing for Tilburg Trappers in the German Oberliga. Bulmer previously iced with the Nottingham Panthers and the Fife Flyers in the EIHL. He was selected by the Minnesota Wild in the second round (39th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.

Playing career
On April 21, 2011, Bulmer was signed by the Minnesota Wild to a three-year entry-level contract. Bulmer made his NHL debut on opening night of the 2011–12 season on October 8, 2011. After playing in nine NHL games, in which he registered three assists, six penalty minutes, and a plus-one rating, the 19-year-old was returned to his junior team the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League to continue his development on October 31, 2011. Bulmer missed a portion of the 2012–13 AHL season due to injuries.

On December 12, 2013, Bulmer was recalled to the Minnesota Wild, he played in 5 games going scoreless, before he was reassigned to Iowa on December 20, 2013.

As an un-signed free agent from the Wild over the summer, Bulmer opted to continue his career abroad, signing mid-season deal with Finnish club, Ilves Tampere of the top tier Liiga on October 30, 2016. On February 6, 2017, he transferred to ERC Ingolstadt of the German DEL, signing a contract for the remainder of the 2016–17 campaign. Bulmer appeared in the final 7 regular season games with Ingolstadt, contributing with 3 points before suffering a preliminary playoff loss to the Fischtown Pinguins to conclude his tenure with ERC.

On September 28, 2017, Bulmer opted to continue his career back in North America, signing a one-year ECHL contract with the Florida Everblades.

Ahead of the 2018–19 season, Bulmer penned a one-year deal with British EIHL side Fife Flyers. In August 2019, Bulmer moved to Fife's Elite League counterparts Nottingham Panthers.

In February 2020, an issue with Bulmer's visa forced Nottingham to release him from his contract - although the club did not rule out the player returning for next season. Bulmer then joined DEL2 side EHC Freiburg, a side led by former Glasgow Clan coach Pete Russell.

After a 76-point season with Oberliga side Hannover Indians in 2020–21, Bulmer opted to remain in the German third tier and signed for Tilburg Trappers for the 2021–22 season.

98,197,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type9,"Volvo Car Gent (until 2007 known as  Volvo Cars Europe Industry N.V.) is an automobile manufacturer located in the port district of Ghent in western Belgium. In recent years, the Ghent plant has become the largest Volvo plant in terms of the number of cars produced. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish automaker, Volvo Personvagnar AB (Volvo Cars). Legally it is part of Volvo Car Belgium NV. Its activities comprise welding, painting and final assembly. The plant became the only car manufacturing plant in Flanders after Ford Genk closed at the end of 2014.

The plant opened in 1965. It was the first European Volvo plant outside Sweden. The Ghent location was chosen because it was centrally positioned within the EEC and was supported by a good transport infrastructure.

The first Volvo produced in Ghent was the company’s 120 Series (120/121/122, later 130), also known as Amazon. In September 2012 the plant was producing the Volvo C30, Volvo V40, Volvo S60 and Volvo XC60 models, of which the XC60 was the top seller, thanks in part to tax advantages available in certain key markets for the DRIVe version. In 2011 the company was hoping to match the 258,000 units of output achieved in 2005, the plant’s top production year till that point.

In 2015 the Ghent plant employed about 5,400 people. Volvo Car Gent produced 252,479 cars (XC60, V40 and S60) in 2015. In 2017 Volvo Car Gent started to produce the first new vehicle on the CMA platform (Compact Modular Architecture), the XC40.

The city of Ghent is also home to a Volvo truck plant. This plant is part of Volvo Group Belgium and, apart from the Volvo brand name, is no longer linked to the car activities in Belgium. This plant was formerly known as Volvo Europa Truck.

In November 2016 the 6th million car was produced.

Name
The plant's name is Volvo Car Gent and not Volvo Cars Ghent. It is a proper name in which the city name is in its original Dutch spelling, not in English.

Companies based in East FlandersJudith Salzedo Hays  (December 30, 1823 – March 1, 1881) was a Jewish-American teacher and principal from New York.

Life 
Peixotto was born on December 30, 1823 in New York City, New York, the daughter of Dr. Daniel Levy Maduro Peixotto and Rachel Sexias. Her father was a Dutch immigrant and physician, and her paternal grandfather Moses Levi Maduro Peixotto was hazan of Shearith Israel. Her siblings included merchant Raphael Peixotto and diplomat Benjamin F. Peixotto.

Following her father's death in 1843, Peixotto began working as a teacher and became the family's main support as the eldest sibling. Her sisters Zipporah and Sarah also worked as teachers, and the three of them were among the first known Jewish women to work as teachers in New York. When New York City first opened evening schools in 1847, she spent the next two years in charge of the Female Evening School in James Street. By 1850, she left the evening school and became one of three principals in the James Street elementary school, making her the first Jewish principal in New York.

In 1852, Peixotto married pharmacist David Solis Hays. She gave up teaching after her marriage. Their children were Sarah Rosalie, Daniel Peixotto, Rebecca Touro, Benjamin Franklin, George Davis, Rachel Peixotto, David Solis Jr., and Cora Florence.

Peixotto died on March 1, 1881. She was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery.

A 5'10"", 180-pound cornerback, he played college football at the University of Tennessee, and was selected in the first round (9th overall) of the 1988 NFL Draft.

A five-time Pro Bowl selection from 1992 to 1996, McDaniel had 35 career interceptions for 667 yards and 6 touchdowns. His five interceptions returned for touchdowns over his career with the Raiders are a team record.  His 34 interceptions are the third-highest in franchise history, and his 624 return yards are the second-highest.

High school

A native of Mansfield, Ohio, McDaniel attended Saginaw High School in Saginaw, Michigan, where he played football and ran track.  In football, he played both wide receiver and running back.  As a senior, he accumulated 1,582 yards of total offense, and was named to the all-conference team.  In track, he won Michigan state titles in the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes, with personal bests of 10.46 and 21.20, respectively.

College career

McDaniel signed with the University of Tennessee in 1983 to play football and run track. Initially a wide receiver, he redshirted during his first year. During the 1984 season, he appeared in every game except the season opener, caught one pass for 19 yards, and returned 5 kickoffs for a total of 59 yards.  He had 3 tackles as part of the kickoff return coverage unit.

Just before the start of the 1985 season, McDaniel switched to cornerback.  Working with defensive backs coach Ron Zook, he received considerable playing time early in the season due to injuries to starters.  In Tennessee's 31–29 win over Wake Forest, he had an interception and recovered a fumble.  In the first quarter of Tennessee's 30–0 shutout of Vanderbilt on November 30, Commodore tailback Carl Woods broke loose and ran 65 yards for what would have been a touchdown, but was chased down and tackled by McDaniel at the Tennessee 15-yard line.  McDaniel had 3 tackles and an interception in Tennessee's 35–7 victory over Miami in the 1986 Sugar Bowl.  He finished the season with 18 tackles, 13 of which were solo tackles.

By the 1986 season, McDaniel was in the starting lineup.  In Tennessee's 27–23 loss to Mississippi State, he broke up three passes. In Tennessee's loss to Auburn, McDaniel registered a team-leading 13 tackles, including one in which he chased down running back Brent Fullwood to prevent what would have been a 96-yard touchdown run.  He had an interception in each of Tennessee's last three games against Ole Miss, Kentucky and Vanderbilt.  He finished the season with 68 tackles (45 solo) and 3 interceptions.

During his senior season in 1987, McDaniel registered 57 tackles (38 solo), 2 interceptions and a team-leading 8 broken-up passes.  In the Vols' win over Mississippi State, McDaniel prevented another long touchdown run when he chased down and stopped Bulldog running back Hank Phillips at the Tennessee 15-yard line.  His hit on Phillips jarred the ball loose, and it was recovered by Vol linebacker Darrin Miller.   He was named All-SEC and 2nd-team All-American.  He also received Academic All-SEC honors.  His career totals at Tennessee included 146 tackles (97 solo), 11 passes broken up, and 6 interceptions.

As a member of the Tennessee track team, McDaniel, along with Jeff Powell, Sam Graddy and Allen Franklin, captured the SEC Championship in the 4 x 100-meter relay in 1985.  He also set school records in the 300-meter and 300-yard dashes.

Professional career

Following the 1987 season, McDaniel was considered one of the nation's top players in man-to-man coverage, and was ranked the number two cornerback by The Sporting News.  He was selected by the Los Angeles Raiders in first round (9th overall pick) of the 1988 NFL Draft.  He missed most of his rookie year with a broken leg, but saw extensive play in the following nine seasons with the Raiders, initially in Los Angeles and later in Oakland.

His five interceptions returned for touchdowns over his career with the Raiders are a team record.  His 34 interceptions are the third-highest in franchise history, and his 624 return yards are the second-highest.  He was selected for the Pro Bowl five times, every year from 1992 to 1996.

McDaniel's best season statistically was the 1994 season, in which he had seven interceptions.  In the Raiders' 48-16 win over Denver on September 18, 1994, McDaniel intercepted a pass from John Elway and returned it 15 yards for a touchdown. In the team's 21-17 win over New England on October 9, 1994, McDaniel intercepted three passes from Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, one of which he returned for a touchdown, and one of which set up the go-ahead touchdown.

McDaniel missed three games during the 1997 season due to a knee injury, and was released by the Raiders prior to the 1998 season. He played his final NFL season that year as a member of the Seattle Seahawks. His career statistics include 35 interceptions for 667 yards and six touchdowns.  His longest interception returned for a touchdown was 56 yards, which took place in the Raiders' loss to Minnesota on November 17, 1996.  In a game against Denver on November 22, 1992, he intercepted two passes by Tommy Maddox, and returned each for a career-long 67 yards (134 total return yards).

NFL career statistics

Post-playing career

After his final season in the NFL, McDaniel returned to Knoxville, Tennessee, with his wife and children.  He has since become active in the city's Children of God Ministries church.  McDaniel's son, Isaiah, joined the Tennessee squad as a preferred walk-on in 2014.

61,200,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type7,"James White McClung (June 6, 1798 – May 31, 1848) was an American lawyer and politician during the early days of Alabama statehood. He served in the Alabama state legislature between 1822 and 1844, was Speaker of the House from 1835–1838, and served in the state Senate from 1845–1849. At the time of his death he was a candidate for the United States Senate, without opposition. McClung Avenue in Hunstville is named for him, the first street in that city to be named after a local citizen.

Biography

McClung was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Charles McClung and Margaret White McClung. His father was a leading citizen of Knoxville in its early days, and his mother was the daughter of General James White, founder of White's Fort, which became Knoxville after Charles McClung laid out its initial street grid. He attended Blount College (now the University of Tennessee) and the University of North Carolina, graduating in 1816 with a law degree. He settled in Huntsville, Alabama, shortly after Alabama became a state in 1819.

He was first elected to the state legislature in 1822 and soon became embroiled in a feud with Andrew Wills, editor of the Huntsville Democrat. Wills was a strong opponent of the Bank of the United States, and regularly attacked two leading pro-Bank legislators, Dr David Moore and Clement Comer Clay, in the press. McClung was Clay's law partner, and when Wills accused McClung of bribing the Alabama state legislature to elect Clay to the United States Senate, the ongoing press war spilled into the streets. On July 23, 1827, a confrontation between McClung and Wills on the courthouse square turned into a duel. In an exchange of shots, Wills was killed by McClung. Clay represented McClung at the subsequent trial, and, ""in true frontier style,"" McClung was acquitted by the jury.

He served six terms in the state legislature between 1822 and 1844 before his 1844 election to a four-year term in the State Senate. Between legislative terms he ran for governor in 1841 as an independent, losing to the Democratic candidate, Benjamin Fitzpatrick. A contemporary observer described him as ""fighting for what others could not see or understand, however obvious his policy to himself,"" though the same source added that as a lawyer, ""His qualifications as presiding officer were of the highest order"".

McClung married three times. His first wife was Sarah Elizabeth Mitchell, daughter of Georgia governor David Brydie Mitchell. They had six children before her death on May 25, 1833. Upon his wife's death James White McClung placed his infant son Matthew in the care of his brother-in-law and wife, Mr and Mrs John Robinson of Huntsville. The Robinsons eventually adopted Matthew. On July 2, 1834, McClung married Elizabeth Spotswood; they had two children before her death on September 18, 1837. McClung's third wife, Margaret Patrick, was twenty years his junior when they married on June 6, 1839. They had six children.

McClung's Huntsville mansion, built in 1838, is on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Twickenham Historic District and in the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey.

Eleanor Fineman was born in the Bronx on February 27, 1935. Her parents, Sol Fineman and Jeanette Efron, were Polish Jews who had recently immigrated to the United States.

She attended the Music and Art High School in New York, New School for Social Research, and then the City College of New York, graduating in 1958.

There she met David Antin, a poet who would become her husband in 1961. She studied acting and had some roles, including performing in a staged reading with Ossie Davis at the first NAACP convention. She and her husband moved to San Diego in 1968.

She taught at the University of California at Irvine from 1974–79, and from 1979 was professor of visual arts at the University of California at San Diego.

Career 
When she began her artistic career in New York, she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages, but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus. The first was Blood of a Poet Box (1965-1968), in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides. The work, which was inspired by Jean Cocteau’s film Blood of a Poet, eventually held 100 samples, including blood from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and is in the collection of the Tate Modern.

In 1969, she created a portrait, Molly Barnes, out of ""a lush lavender bath rug, a noisy electric Lady Schick razor, a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills."" Molly Barnes was just one of a series of ""semantic portraits of people, sometimes real, some-times fictional, [made] out of configurations of brand-new consumer goods"" that Antin created.

100 Boots is Antin's best-known conceptual work. In this project, she set up 100 boots in various configurations and settings, photographed them, and created 51 postcards of the images that were mailed to hundreds of recipients around the world from 1971-73. 100 Boots relied on the recipients to remember and construct the boots' adventures, as the postcards were mailed out at intervals ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks ""depending upon what [Antin] took to be the 'internal necessities' of the narrative."" It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo diary, beginning at the Pacific Ocean and ending in New York City, where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.

In a famous performance work of 1972, Carving: A Traditional Sculpture, Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting. The somber, almost classical work is a staple of early feminist art, according to the New York Times art critic Karen Rosenberg.

In The Eight Temptations, 1972, Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures, resisting the temptation to eat snack foods that would violate her diet. In the 1970s/80s, she created several videos in which she played invented personae, including an Elizabethan-style king, a Romantic-era ballerina, a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova, and Eleanor Nightingale, a character that is a combination of Florence Nightingale and the artist herself.

In 1974, Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self: ""I was interested in defining the limits of myself. I consider the usual aids to self-definition—sex, age, talent, time and space—as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice.""

From the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called ""Selves"" that implemented through several art forms. This project encompassed  four videos: The King (1972), The Ballerina and the Bum (1974), The Adventures of a Nurse (1976), and From the Archives of Modern Art (1987).

More recently, Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology: The Last Days of Pompeii, 2002, and Roman Allegories, 2005. Her work was profiled in Season Two of the PBS series Art:21.

She has had dozens of solo exhibitions and has been represented in countless group exhibitions, including at the Hirshhorn Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Kunsthalle Wien, and documenta 12 in Kassel. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Jewish Museum, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.

Her work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society. ""I was determined to present women without pathos or helplessness,"" she wrote in a feminist artist statement for the Brooklyn Museum.

In a 2009 interview, Antin described her path to becoming an artist: ""When I was a kid, I didn't know what kind of artist I was. I knew I was an artist, I just didn't know if I was an actor, I didn't know if I was a writer, I didn't even know if I was a painter. I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down. It was a time of invention and discovery. I was lucky.""

In 2013, Antin published an autobiographical novel, Conversations with Stalin, about ""a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants"", and ""her desperate, endearing, often hilarious quest for art, self, revolution and sex, abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice.""

Her image is included in the iconic 1972 poster  Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.

Other human rights problems include violence against detainees; lengthy pretrial detentions and failure to provide due process of law; harassment of journalists; corruption in government; violence against and harassment of women; child prostitution and abuse; trafficking in persons; encroachment on indigenous lands and discrimination against indigenous and Afro-descendent communities; violence against and harassment of LGBT persons; ineffective enforcement of labor laws; and child labor. Organized criminal elements were significant perpetrators of violent crimes in the country and committed acts of murder, extortion, kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, and intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders. 

The government has taken steps to prosecute and punish officials who commit abuses . However, corruption and impunity remain serious problems that impede the effectiveness of the National Police.

Pre-twentieth century

Pre-1979

During much of the twentieth century, Honduras did not have civilian governments. Military leaders frequently became presidents, either through elections or by coups d'état. General Tiburcio Carías Andino was elected in 1932, he later on called a constituent assembly that allowed him to be reelected, and his rule became more authoritarian until an election in 1948. During the following decades, coups d'état occurred in October 1955 by a group of military officers, in October 1963 (1963 Honduran coup d'état) and December 1972 by General Oswaldo López Arellano, in 1975 by Juan Alberto Melgar Castro (1975 Honduran coup d'état) and in 1978 by Policarpo Paz García.

1980s

Following the return to civilian government with a new constitution in 1982, the military unit Intelligence Battalion 3-16 carried out a systematic program of political assassinations and torture of suspected political opponents of the government. Battalion members received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency both in Honduras and at United States military bases and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people were ""disappeared"" from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely by the Honduran military. At least 19 members of Battalion 3-16 were graduates of the School of the Americas at Fort Benning in the USA.

In 1982, in response to these human rights violations, 12 families of disappeared Hondurans, including Bertha Oliva de Nativí, whose husband Professor Tomás Nativí was disappeared in 1981, created the human rights NGO Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (Comité de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras, COFADEH).

Other human rights NGOs, including the Center for the Investigation and Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CIPRODEH) for the western region of Honduras, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), and the Civic Council of Grassroots and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), were also created.

Zelaya presidency (2006-2009)
Seven former members of Battalion 3-16 (Billy Joya, Alvaro Romero, Erick Sánchez, Onofre Oyuela Oyuela, Napoleón Nassar Herrera, Vicente Rafael Canales Nuñez, Salomón Escoto Salinas and René Maradianga Panchamé) occupied important positions in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya as of mid-2006, according to the human rights organisation CODEH. Napoleón Nassar was high Commissioner of Police for the north-west region under Zelaya.

Roberto Micheletti de facto presidency

Background 
Following the 2009 coup d'état, in which Zelaya was detained and exiled by Honduran military units, de facto President Roberto Micheletti appointed former Battalion 3-16 member Billy Joya as his security advisor, former Battalion 3-16 member Nelson Willy Mejía Mejía became Director of Immigration, and former Battalion 3-16 member Napoleón Nassar Herrera, who had already become a high Commissioner of Police, also became a spokesperson ""for dialogue"" for the Secretary of Security. Zelaya claimed that Billy Joya had reactivated the death squad.

A state of emergency was operational for most of July and continued into August. This suspended civil liberties including freedom of transit and due process, as well as permitting search and seizure without a warrant. A curfew law was introduced, without having been published in La Gazeta, nor being approved by Congress. Curfew times are announced on radio stations, differ daily and between regions of Honduras. Amnesty International described the curfew implementation as ""arbitrary"".

The ambassadors of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua said that on the 29th they were detained and beaten by Honduran troops before being released. Several government officials were taken into custody by the military.  A dozen former ministers from the Zelaya government went into hiding, some in foreign embassies, fearing arrest. Local media reported that at least eight ministers besides Patricia Rodas had been detained.

During the first few weeks of the Micheletti period, hundreds of political arrests were made. COFADEH reported that 609 people, of whom at least 61 minors, were detained for ""political scandal"" (participation in political demonstrations), and 158 were detained for violating curfew, between 28 June and 12 July. Amnesty International (AI) stated that during the Micheletti period, ""increasingly disproportionate and excessive use of force [was] being used by the police and military to repress legitimate and peaceful protests across the country"". AI also said that ""some women and girls taking part in the demonstrations are reportedly suffering gender based violence and abuse at the hands of police officers"" and that at the same time that ""protests increase and spread throughout the country, violent methods of repressing dissent intensify and Honduran citizens are increasingly exposed to violations of their fundamental rights.""

On 31 July, Zelaya claimed that Battalion 3-16 was again operating, with a different name, and being led by Billy Joya. Zelaya stated (translation), ""With a different name, [Battalion 3-16 is] already operating. The crimes being committed is torture to create fear among the population, and that's being directed by Mr. Joya.""

Forced disappearances
On 5 July, in San Juan Pueblo, Atlántida, four people wearing police vests forcefully disappeared Anastasio Barrera, 55 years old, of the National Union of Rural Workers.

On 12 July, in San Pedro Sula, Manuel Sevilla, 19 years old, was disappeared after returning from a demonstration.

Samuel David Flores Murillo, 24 years old was disappeared on 26 July 2009. His mother, Margarita Murillo, was herself detained and tortured for 22 days in the 1980s.

Extrajudicial executions
The death of Vicky Hernández Castillo (born Sonny Emelson Hernández), a member of the LGBT community who was killed by a bullet in the eye during the curfew of the night of 29 to 30 June and displayed signs of strangulation, is attributed to the coup d'état by COFADEH.

On 3 July in Tegucigalpa, Alexis Fernando Amador, 25 yrs old, was found dead in a blue plastic barrel with mortal wounds in his head, wearing a T-shirt referring to the ""cuarta urna"" (Fourth ballot box) that might have been voted on in the poll relating to organising a constituent assembly in Honduras. His parents said he had disappeared the day before, and insisted that the shirt he was found in was not his, and that he had left for work in a red shirt. COFADEH attributes his death to the coup d'état.

Also on 3 July, journalist Gabriel Fino Noriega who had expressed opinions in favour of the project to hold a constituent assembly in Honduras and against the coup d'état, was killed by 7 bullets when he left his workplace. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'état, while an international human rights mission considered Noriega's political points of view to offer a line of research for understanding the death, but insufficient proof that the reason for the killing was political.

On 5 July, when soldiers prevented a plane carrying Zelaya from landing at Toncontin Airport, Isis Obed Murillo Mencias, the 19-year-old son of a social and environmental activist, Jose David Murillo Sanchez, 57 years old, was shot in the back of the head, while participating in a protest that attempted to tear down a fence. According to the Miami Herald, Isis Obed Murillo was shot by soldiers who tried to prevent people passing through the fence.  It was later claimed by unknown sources that the shot did not came from the soldiers' position, but rather from the protest's direction. According to another unnamed source, while the soldiers did carry weapons, they were M16 rifles, which did not match the 9 mm bullet hole found on Murillo. Isis Obed Murillo was  taken to Escuela Hospital and his body taken to the Francisco Morazan Judicial Morgue. On 9 July at 11:30 in the morning, Jose David Murillo was detained by Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal (DNIC) agents when he left the offices of COFADEH. Since then he has been held at the Juticalpa Penal Centre in an isolation cell three metres by three metres in size, without a bed. Images of Isis Obed Murillo's bloodstained body were widely circulated and became a focal point for people opposed to the coup d'état.

Roger Iván Bados (sometimes written Báez), a former union leader, who had become a member of the Democratic Unification Party and the Popular Bloque (BP), was ""threatened with death immediately after the coup"" and shot dead on 11 July next to his house in San Pedro Sula. According to Dr Luther Castillo of the Garifuna community organisation Luaga Hatuadi Waduheñu Foundation, the assassination ""can be directly attributed to"" the Micheletti's de facto government. An international human rights mission also attributes Bados' death ""in relation to"" the coup d'état.

The death of 40-year-old campesino leader Ramón García, also a member of the Democratic Unification Party, on 12 July, after he was forced by unknown people to get off a bus, is also attributed to Micheletti's de facto government by Luther Castillo.

On 24 July, near the border town El Paraíso, conflict occurred between hundreds of protesters against the coup d'état and security forces. Many people saw protester Pedro Magdiel Muñoz Salvador, 23 years old, being detained by police and driven to a police station in El Paraíso. The following morning, his body was found in a deserted field at 6:30 in the morning, with 42 wounds from stabbing. Demonstrators and the National Front Against the Coup d'État stated that the murder had all the characteristics of 1980s actions of Battalion 3-16, as a method of ""terrorising the masses of people participating in the struggle against the coup regime.""

On 31 July, during a peaceful protest that blocked a highway on the first day of a public service national strike against the coup d'état, high school teacher Roger Abraham Vallejo Soriano, 38 years old, was shot in the head by security forces. He died the following day.

Another assassination in the region near the Nicaraguan border near El Paraíso took place on 2 August when a soldier at a military roadblock fatally shot Pedro Pablo Hernández in the head. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'état. The Office of the Public Prosecutor stated to IACHR during the latter's 17–21 August visit that the case was being investigated.

On 8 August in Choloma, Juan Gabriel Figueroa Tomé, 30 yrs old, who was an active member of resistance to the coup d'état, was taken by armed men who said that they didn't want his motorbike, they wanted him. He was found dead, shot in the head, the following day, 9 August. COFADEH attributes his assassination to the coup d'état.

Zelaya return
Zelaya returned to Honduras on 21 September 2009, and stayed in the Brazilian Embassy, while Micheletti remained the de facto president. Security forces under the responsibility of de facto president Micheletti carried out systematic human rights violations, including a ""sharp rise in police beatings,"" hundreds of arrests of political demonstrators and intimidation of human rights defenders throughout Honduras. On 22 September, 15 police fired tear gas canisters at the building of the human rights NGO Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH), at a moment when about 100 people were in the COFADEH office. Dozens of protesters were detained in unauthorised detention sites in Tegucigalpa on 22 September.

On 16 October 2009, Human Rights Watch stated that ""the small human rights unit of the Office of the Attorney General has begun investigations into numerous cases of killings, alleged excessive use of force by security officials, and illegal and arbitrary detentions"" but that the unit's superiors in the Attorney General's office and armed forces members were obstructing the investigations.

The Micheletti de facto government issued Decree PCM-M-016-2009 which officially signed on 22 September 2009 and rescinded on 19 October 2009. The decree suspended five constitutional rights: personal liberty (Article 69), freedom of expression (Article 72), freedom of movement (Article 81), habeas corpus (Article 84) and freedom of association. On 28 September, the decree was used to shut down the television stations Channel 36 and Radio Globo, which were ""consistently critical of the de facto government"" and removed the stations' broadcasting equipment. Government security forces physically assaulted international journalists covering the raid on Radio Globo. On 29 September, the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IAHCR) ""expressed its most energetic rejection"" of the decree and asked for the immediate suspension of its enforcement, because it ""flagrantly [contradicted] the international standards for freedom of expression"".

Amnesty International protested to the Honduran de facto government about the violation of habeas corpus on 28 and 29 November. One of the people who were allegedly disappeared was Jensys Mario Umanzor Gutierrez, last seen in police detention early on the morning of 30 November. Amnesty International (AI) stated that no courts, including the Supreme Court, were available to receive a petition for habeas corpus. AI also referred to two men arrested under terrorism charges and beaten, and 14 minors detained under decree PCM-M-016-2009 for having been gathered in groups of more than four persons, and later freed without charges. AI also said that human rights organizations in Honduras ""suffered attacks and acts of intimidation"".

In December 2009 the head of Honduras' anti-drug smuggling operations,  Gen Julian Aristides Gonzalez, was assassinated in Tegucigalpa, as was anti-coup activist and LGBT rights leader Walter Trochez.

Porfirio Lobo Sosa
Porfirio Lobo Sosa won the November Honduran general election, 2009 and took office on 27 January 2010. Under his Presidency human rights abuses continued. According to Human Rights Watch, ""at least eight journalists and ten members of the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP)—a political group that opposed the 2009 coup and advocated  the reinstatement of the ousted president, Manuel Zelaya—have been killed since President Lobo assumed power on January 27, 2010.""

Journalist David Meza was assassinated in March 2010; he investigated drug trafficking within Honduras, and reportedly received death threats in 2010, according to the El Tiempo newspaper. Another reporter, Nahúm Elí Palacios Arteaga, was also assassinated in March 2010. Luis Arturo Mondragón was killed in June 2010.

Human Rights Watch has reported attacks on the independence of the judiciary and public prosecutors. ""The May dismissal of four lower-court judges who challenged the legality of the 2009 coup has severely damaged the credibility of the Honduran judiciary."" One of the dismissed judges ""told Human Rights Watch that, since his dismissal, several judges have confided in him that the fear of dismissal by the government influences their judicial decision-making. A prosecutor from the human rights prosecutor's office said fellow prosecutors had expressed the same concern."" Human Rights Watch concluded that ""Honduras has made little progress toward restoring the rule of law since the coup.""

59,204,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type5,"From the late 1980s to the mid-2000s, Alianza Islámica was the largest and most influential Latino Muslim organization in U.S. history. It was co-founded in New York City's fabled Spanish Harlem by three Puerto Rican Muslims - John (Yahya) Figueroa, Ramon (Rahim) Ocasio, and Freddie (Ibrahim) Gonzalez, who all lived within five blocks of each other.

Alianza Islamica has become an iconic model for inner-city, grassroots Muslim activism with the new generation of Latino Muslim activists for its emphasis on bringing the message of Islam and Islamic service to the most disadvantaged and broken. The two remaining founders, Figueroa and Ocasio, have kept Alianza's message legacy alive through lectures, interviews and articles. most of which are available at the website alianzaislamica.org.

History 
Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez all came of age during the tumultuous '60s and early '70s. As teenagers, they became associated with the militant Young Lords Party during that organization's heyday in New York City. Ocasio, Figueroa, and Gonzalez participated in organizations affiliated with the Party. That organization stood out for its activism, vigorous social and educational programs, and unwavering support for Puerto Rican independence.

After ending their association with the YLP, Figueroa and Ocasio briefly joined the Nation of Islam breakaway group The Five-Percent Nation. Though short-lived, their exposure to the Nation of Islam, with its strong message of self-reliance and economic independence, was to become a significant influence.

Between late 1972 and mid-1973, all three of the future founders converted to Islam. In 1975, Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez joined the Islamic Party of North America, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim organization. It was the United States' first constitutionally-based indigenous Islamic organization. With a keen emphasis on disciplined, coordinated activism, the Islamic Party expressed Islam through civic engagement and addressed problems of poverty and social and economic injustice.

Ocasio moved to IPNA's Washington headquarters and was eventually elected to that branch's Guidance Council. Meanwhile, Figueroa and Gonzalez continued the Party's work in New York. Ocasio rejoined Figueroa and Gonzalez in New York City in 1978. What followed were years of dawah (Islamic proselytizing) and attempts at organizing, which met with limited success.  

In 1986, the trio collaborated on a successful event at the Museo del Barrio on Fifth Avenue in New York entitled ""Reclamado Nuestra Herencia Islamica (Reclaiming Our Islamic Heritage). There they met Daniel Ahmad Mena from Florida and Carl Askia Al Amin from Chicago, who, along with Figueroa, Ocasio, and Gonzalez, formed the first iteration of Alianza Islamica. A virtual, three-city partnership, it most notable accomplishment was its eponymous journal, the first bilingual Islamic periodical ever published in the United States. Logistical problems, however, led to the organization's dissolution after nearly two years.

In the late 80s, Figueroa and Ocasio discussed going in a new direction: the establishment of a Barrio-based storefront center inspired by the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood's tea room of the '70s. Its calm, non-intimidating ambiance would distinguish the center, and be the antidote to alienating high pressure evangelizing. The center would be an unassuming, unobtrusive, and an organic part of the neighborhood.

Meanwhile, Figueroa's work with recovering addicts led to a sizable number of converts and the first-ever Muslim recovery group, Brothers in Recovery. With these new Muslims at its core, Figueroa and Ocasio decided to resurrect Alianza Islamica. A storefront was secured at 1717 Lexington Avenue, near 107th Street, in El Barrio, Spanish Harlem.

Though Alianza Islamica's priority was the spread of the message of Islam, a more holistic approach was advanced to best serve its disadvantaged community. To that end, Alianza developed GED and ESL programs as well as programs on health and nutrition, employment assistance, and drug counseling. A significant number of spousal abuse cases, primarily in marriages between Latinas and Arab husbands, prompted Alianza Islamica also to take action in and initiate a counseling program in this area.

At a time when Muslim institutions treated their fellow Muslims who died of AIDS/HIV as pariahs, Alianza became the first Islamic organization to ritually wash the bodies of their co-religionists who had died of the disease. Alianza Islamic also conducted outreach programs to educate Muslims and non-Muslims alike on AIDS/HIV.

To dispel the spectre of the alien, Alianza embarked on Islamizing Latino cultural elements. At religious holidays such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha, lamb and chicken replaced pork in traditional dishes, and congas and ""guitarras"" created a soundtrack authentically Muslim and Latino.

Alianza Islamica cleared drug dealers from the neighborhood on at least two occasions. On the second occasion, the owner of a building across the street offered Alianza Islamica a new location in return for their assistance with ridding his building of drug dealers from the notorious Jamaican Posse. Alianza used the opportunity to establish La Mezquita del Barrio, the first Latino Muslim mosque on the East Coast, and quite possibly the nation.

After Alianza cleared the drug dealers from the area, the landlord initiated eviction proceedings against Alianza. After its removal from the premises, Alianza resettled at 287 Alexander Avenue in the South Bronx. The organization disbanded shortly after a fire destroyed their building in 2005.  

13.

Post Alianza Islamica 
Ibrahim Gonzalez went on to a distinguished career as a musician, activist, and television and radio personality known primarily for his popular radio show on WBAI. He died in his sleep In 2013 at age 57.

After 30 years on the railroad, Figueroa devoted himself to drug counseling and writing and lecturing on Alianza Islamica's legacy and Islam's spiritual dimension.

Ocasio also ended his railroad career after 35 years and settled to a life of writing, lecturing, and spending time on the family farm.

In 2021, Rahim Ocasio with Juan Jose Galvan announced their book project, Alianza Islamica: Spanish Harlem’s Islamic Odyssey.

One year before the creating of the TEE-network the French railway SNCF introduced three Trains d'affaires to link Paris with the industrial area in the North near the Belgian border. This trains were scheduled with a morning, midday and evening service in both directions. Initially the service was operated with RGP 600 DMUs. In 1959 these were replaced by locomotive hauled trains consisting of Corail coaches. Although domestic TEE-services were allowed from 1965 the Trains d'affaires were not upgraded until 1978. Together with the upgrading to TEE the trains were named. The evening service pair was named Watteau. In 1991 the service between Tourcoing and Paris was converted to a two-class Rapide. The Watteau revived in the Paris- Brussels service on 23 May 1993 for two years. On 26 May 1995 the Watteau was the last TEE service.

51,205,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type7,"Guy-Victor Duperré (20 February 1775, La Rochelle2 November 1846, Paris) was a French naval officer and Admiral of France.

Duperré famously commanded naval forces in the Mauritius Campaign and was victorious in the Battle of Grand Port, where he was wounded. Later he had a command in the Mediterranean and continued to serve during and after the Bourbon Restoration. He commanded the naval elements of the expeditionary force that carried out the Invasion of Algiers in 1830 and went on to become Minister of the Navy three times.

Biography

Youth 
Duperré was born in La Rochelle to Jean Augustin Duperré, counselor of the king and financer for war, and Marie-Gabrielle Prat-Desprez. He spent a few years with the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri at the Collège de Juilly, before enlisting at 16 on the Henri IV, a French East Indiaman.

French Revolution 
In November 1792, Duperré joined the Navy. He served against the Netherlands and Britain aboard the corvette Maire-Guiton, and later aboard the frigate Tortu. In May 1796, he was made an auxiliary ensign aboard the Virginie. In June, he was captured by the British during a night fight. He was exchanged two years later and made a full rank enseign, taking command of the corvette Pélagie.

In 1804, he was made a lieutenant de vaisseau, and later assistant of the préfet maritime of Boulogne-sur-Mer. In 1806, he served off Brazil aboard the Vétéran, under Jérôme Bonaparte. Back to France, he was promoted to capitaine de frégate on 28 September. In 1808, commanding the frigate Sirène, he led a troop convoy to Martinique; returning to France, he was intercepted by a British blockade off Lorient, and managed to escape by beaching his ship.

Napoléon made him a capitaine de vaisseau and knight of the Légion d'honneur, before promoting him to Commodore. On 6 December 1810, Duperré was made Baron of the Empire.

Duperré was sent to the Isle de France (now Mauritius) aboard the frigate Bellone, fighting several British ships in the process, notably the action of 3 July 1810. On 23 August 1810, he won the Battle of Grand Port, completely destroying a British squadron. He was wounded in this battle. The naval victory made its way on the Arc de Triomphe. In recognition, Duperré was promoted to contre-amiral when he returned to France in September 1811.

From 1812 to 1814, Duperré commanded the Italian and French naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. In 1814, he defended Venice against Austria.

Restoration

Duperré was made Préfet maritime of Toulon during the Hundred Days, and was retired during the Bourbon Restoration. In 1818, he was brought back to active duty. He commanded the squadron which blockaded Cadiz during the war which reinstated Ferdinand VII of Spain on the throne. In October 1823, he was made vice-admiral, grand officier de la Légion d'honneur and Commander of the Order of Saint Louis in 1824. In 1827, he was made Préfet maritime of Brest and inspector of the 5th arrondissement militaire.

Though Duperré  was critical towards the expedition against Algiers, Charles X made him commander of the fleet which ferried troops under Bourmont to depose the Algerian Regency. The fleet of the invasion of Algiers and shipwreck of Dellys was 103 warships strong, with 572 freighters ferrying 35 000 soldiers, 3 800 horses and 91 heavy guns. In recognition for his role, Duperré was made pair de France on 16 July 1830.

July Monarchy 

After the July Revolution, all pairages were cancelled as a whole. Duperré was reinstated pair de France by Louis-Philippe on 18 August 1830, and promoted to Admiral in March 1831. Then in Africa, Duperré was called back to France and made chief of the council of the Admiralty.

On 18 November 1834, Duperré became Naval Minister in Mortier's government. He retained the office in de Broglie's and Thiers' governments, and got out of office when Thiers' government collapsed on the 16 September 1836. Duperré came back to office on 12 May 1839 in Soult's second government. In 1840, a budget project for the Duke of Nemours was rejected, which made the government collapse; Duperré then said: ""The ministry has received a round shot in the belly, which has gone to hit the wood of the Crown."" Duperré came back again to the ministry on the 29 October 1840 in Soult's third government, until he retired for health reasons on 6 February 1843.

Duperré died on 2 November 1846 in Saint-Servan. Admiral Jean Tupinier said a eulogy in the chamber of the pairs de France.

Honours 

Duperré was buried in the Invalides in a national funeral.  His name is carved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Valentine is an American bioinorganic chemist whose research focuses on biomineralization, the uptake and transport of metals and their medical applications in areas such as cancer research. She has received awards including the 2014 AICChemical Pioneer Award ""for her outstanding contributions towards advancing the science of chemistry and impacting the chemical profession"" and the 2009 Paul D. Saltman Award for Metals in Biology for ""outstanding contributions to the field of metals in biology"" and ""groundbreaking work on the structures and reactions of complexes containing titanium.""

Education

Valentine earned a bachelor's of science in chemistry from the University of Virginia in 1993. As an undergraduate, she researched aluminum inhibition of magnesium-dependent enzymes with Timothy L. Macdonald. She studied with Stephen J. Lippard at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned her PhD in 1998.

Career

From 1998-2001, Valentine worked with Stephen J. Benkovic as a postdoctoral fellow at Pennsylvania State University. She published on the topics of enzyme kinetics, metallo-beta-lactamase, and the mechanics of replisome and primase in DNA replication.

In 2001, Valentine joined the chemistry faculty of Yale University. During her years there, she was able to begin research into the biological role of titanium, a question which she had long found intriguing. Valentine had become interested in the element early in her graduate career: in the early 1990s, titanium was not recognized as important in bioinorganic chemistry, but was believed by some (including her advisor) to be a candidate for future investigation.

In 2011, Valentine became an associate professor at Temple University where she specializes in environmental, material, and medicinal aspects of inorganic and biological chemistry. Her research group focuses on bioinorganic chemistry, especially nicatransferrin, Ti4+ ions, and biotitanification.

Outreach and mentorship

Valentine has participated in the Philadelphia Area Girls Enjoying Science (PAGES) and Temple Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) programs. Via the Temple Teaching and Learning Center, she has acted as a mentor for students in high-attrition courses.

Game summary
The All-Star Game started with a 3-2 lead for Team Kessel, as they emerged victorious in the Skills Competition held on February 10, 2017, which saw both teams compete in a series of five skills events. A pair of twenty-five minute periods was staged at the All-Star Game, rather than the traditional format of three twenty-minute periods.

In the first period, Team Steadman scored the first goal, as Brianna Decker scored against Team Kessel goaltender Brittany Ott. Rookie Alexandra Carpenter was credited with the assist on Decker’s goal, as the score was now tied 3-3.

Kessel would score an unassisted goal on Team Steadman goaltender Brianne McLaughlin to reclaim the lead. Before the period would expire, a total of 10 goals were scored, with Team Kessel claiming an 8-7 lead.

Goals for Team Kessel were scored by Megan Bozek, Rebecca Russo and Harrison Browne, while Kessel scored another. Madison Packer would score twice for Team Steadman. Other Team Steadman scorers in the first included Emily Pfalzer and Kelly Babstock, the first (and only) Canadian-born player to score a goal in the game.

The second period saw Katie Fitzgerald between the pipes for Team Steadman, while Nicole Stock guarded the crease for Team Kessel. Harrison Browne would score another goal, while Hilary Knight also added her name to the scoresheet.

Team Steadman’s other scorers in the second period included Haley Skarupa, Carpenter and Steadman. Of note, Steadman would score to tie the game at 10-apiece. An empty net goal by Kessel would win the game for her team, as she recorded the first hat trick in NWHL All-Star Game history. For her efforts, she was recognized as the Game’s Most Valuable Player.

The peninsula extends  from Mexicali, Baja California in the north to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur in the south. It ranges from  at its narrowest to  at its widest point and has approximately  of coastline and approximately 65 islands. The total area of the Baja California Peninsula is , roughly the same area as the country of Nepal.

The peninsula is separated from mainland Mexico by the Gulf of California and the Colorado River. There are four main desert areas on the peninsula: the San Felipe Desert, the Central Coast Desert, the Vizcaíno Desert and the Magdalena Plain Desert.

History

The land of California existed as a myth among European explorers before it was discovered. The earliest known mention of the idea of California was in the 1510 romance novel Las Sergas de Esplandián by Spanish author Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. The book described the Island of California as being west of the Indies, ""very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons"".

Following Hernán Cortés's conquest of Mexico, the lure of an earthly paradise as well as the search for the fabled Strait of Anián, helped motivate him to send several expeditions to the west coast of New Spain in the 1530s and early 1540s. In 1539, explorer Francisco de Ulloa proved that Baja California was a peninsula rather than an island. Nevertheless, the idea of the island persisted for well over a century and was included in many maps. The water separating the island, now called ""Gulf of California"" was sometimes called the ""Red Sea"". The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula and lands to the north, including both Baja California and Alta California, the region that became parts of the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.

Timeline
1532: Hernán Cortés sends three ships north along the coast of Mexico in search of the Island of California. The three ships disappear without a trace.
1533: Cortés sends a follow-up mission to search for the lost ships. Pilot Fortún Ximénez leads a mutiny and founds a settlement in the Bay of La Paz before being killed.
1539: Francisco de Ulloa explores both coasts.
1622: A map by Michiel Colijn of Amsterdam showed California as a peninsula rather than an island. Previous maps show the Gulf terminating in its correct location.
1690s–1800s: Spanish settlement and colonization in lower Las Californias (Baja California peninsula), the first Spanish missions in Baja California are established by Jesuit missionaries.
1701: Explorations by Eusebio Kino expanded knowledge of the Gulf of California coast. Kino did not believe California was an island.
1767: Jesuits expelled; Franciscans take over the Baja missions.
1769: Franciscans go with the Portola expedition to establish new missions in Alta California. Control of the existing Baja missions passes to the Dominican Order.
1773: Francisco Palóu's line demarcates Franciscan and Dominican areas of mission control.
1804: Las Californias divided into Alta (""Upper"") and Baja (""Lower"") California, using Palóu's line.
1810–1821: Mexican War of Independence
1821: First Mexican Empire, Baja California Territory established, covering Baja California Peninsula.

Political divisions

The province of the Californias was united until 1804, in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain, when it was divided into Alta (upper) and Baja (lower) California.

The two Californias division was kept after Mexican independence in 1821. The Spanish Baja California Province became Mexican Baja California Territory, and remained a separate territory until 1836. In 1836, the Siete Leyes constitutional reforms reunited both Californias in the Departamento de las Californias. After 1848, the Baja California Peninsula again became a Mexican territory when Alta California was ceded to the United States (see 1854 map).

In 1931 Baja California Territory was divided into northern and southern territories. In 1952, the ""North Territory of Baja California"" became the 29th State of Mexico as Baja California. In 1974, the ""South Territory of Baja California"" became the 31st state as Baja California Sur.

Baja California

The northern part is the state of Baja California. It is sometimes informally referred to as Baja California Norte, to distinguish it from both the Baja California Peninsula and the adjacent state Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California are named bajacalifornianos (""Lower Californians"" in English). Mexicali is the capital.

Baja California Sur

The southern part, below 28° north, is the state of Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California Sur are named sudcalifornianos (""South Californians"" in English). La Paz is its capital.

Geology

The Baja California Peninsula was once a part of the North American Plate, the tectonic plate of which mainland Mexico remains a part.  About 12 to 15 million years ago the East Pacific Rise began cutting into the margin of the North American Plate, initiating the separation of the peninsula from it.  Spreading within the Gulf of California consists of short oblique rifts or ridge segments connected by long northwest trending transform faults, which together comprise the Gulf of California Rift Zone.  The north end of the rift zone is located in the Brawley seismic zone in the Salton Sea basin between the Imperial Fault and the San Andreas Fault.  The Baja California Peninsula is now part of the Pacific Plate and is moving with it away from the East Pacific Rise in a north northwestward direction.

Along the coast north of Santa Rosalia, Baja California Sur is a prominent volcanic activity area.

Volcanoes of the peninsula and adjacent islands include:
Volcanoes of east-central Baja California
Cerro Prieto
The San Quintín Volcanic Field
Isla San Luis
Jaraguay volcanic field
Coronado
Guadalupe
San Borja volcanic field
El Aguajito
Tres Vírgenes
Isla Tortuga
Comondú-La Purísima

Researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography have found a 2,000-year-old layer of non-decomposed roots, or peat, up to  under the desert mangroves. The peat layer acts like a sponge for stored atmospheric carbon, a record of sea-level-rise is also recorded in the peat layer.

The desert mangroves restricted to rocky inlets on the rugged coast of Baja California have been growing over their own root remains over thousands of years to compensate for sea-level rise, accumulating a thick layer of peat below their roots. However, mangroves in flat coastal floodplains have accumulated a thinner peat layer.

Geography

The Peninsular Ranges form the backbone of the peninsula.  They are an uplifted and eroded Jurassic to Cretaceous batholith, part of the same original batholith chain which formed much of the Sierra Nevada mountains in U.S. California. This chain was formed primarily as a result of the subduction of the Farallon Plate millions of years ago all along the margin of North America.
   
The Sierra de Juárez is the northernmost range in Mexico.
The Sierra San Pedro Mártir runs south of the Sierra Juarez and includes the peninsula's highest peak, the Picacho del Diablo.
The Sierra de San Borja runs south of the Sierra San Pedro Martir.
The volcanic complex of Tres Virgenes lies in Baja California Sur, near the border with the state of Baja California, forming the ranges south of the Sierra de San Borja.
The Sierra de la Giganta runs along the shore of the Gulf of California south of the Tres Virgenes complex.
At the south end of Baja California Sur, the Sierra de la Laguna forms an isolated mountain range rising to 
Another isolated range, the Sierra Vizcaino, juts out into the Pacific between Punta Eugenia and Punta Abreojos.

The two most prominent capes along the Pacific coastline of the peninsula are Punta Eugenia, located about halfway up the coast, and Cabo San Lazaro, located about a quarter of the way north from Cabo San Lucas.

The Bahia Sebastian Vizcaino, the largest bay in Baja, lies along the Pacific coast halfway up the peninsula.  The large island of Isla Cedros is situated between the bay and the Pacific, just north of Punta Eugenia.  Onshore southeast of the bay is the Desierto de Vizcaino, an extensive desert lying between the Sierra Vizcaino to the west, and the Tres Virgenes range which runs along the Gulf of California to the east.

The largest bays along the coastline of the Gulf are Bahia de La Paz where the city of La Paz is located, and Bahia Concepcion.  The Bahía de los Ángeles is a small bay located west of the Canal de las Ballenas which separates the Baja California peninsula from the large island of Angel de la Guarda in the Gulf of California.

Ecoregions

The peninsula is home to several distinct ecoregions. Most of the peninsula is deserts and xeric shrublands, although pine-oak forests are found in the mountains at the northern and southern ends of the peninsula. The southern tip of the peninsula, which was formerly an island, has many species with affinities to tropical Mexico.
 California chaparral and woodlands, which covers the Mediterranean climate northwestern corner of the peninsula, as well as Cedros and Guadalupe islands.
 Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests in the upper reaches of the Sierra Juárez and Sierra San Pedro Mártir ranges in the northern peninsula.
 The Sonoran Desert extends into the northeastern portion of the state, east of the Sierra Juárez and Sierra San Pedro Mártir ranges.
 The Baja California Desert extends west of the Peninsular Ranges along the Pacific side of the peninsula for most of its length, and includes the El Vizcaíno Desert and El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve.
 The Gulf of California xeric scrub extends along the Gulf of California side of the peninsula for most of its length.
 San Lucan xeric scrub lies in the lowlands of the peninsula's southern tip.
 Sierra de la Laguna dry forests are found on the lower slopes of the Sierra de la Laguna.
 Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests are found at higher elevations in the Sierra de la Laguna.
 The Bahía de los Ángeles Biosphere Reserve

Tourism
The peninsula is known colloquially as Baja by American and Canadian tourists, and is known for its natural environment. It draws ecotourists who go whale watching for migrating California gray whales as well as tourists that arrive to the resorts on the southern tip of the Peninsula. Its location between the North Pacific and Gulf of California give it a reputation for sports fishing.  Since 1967, the peninsula has hosted the Baja 1000, an off road race that begins in Ensenada and ends in La Paz.

63,213,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type2,"Hatchetfish may refer to three groups of fishes:

Marine hatchetfishes, small deep-sea bioluminescent fishes (Stomiiformes) of the family Sternoptychidae, subfamily Sternoptychinae.
Freshwater hatchetfishes, small South and Central American characins of the family Gasteropelecidae.
Triportheus, the elongate hatchetfish, small South American freshwater characins of the family Triporthidae.Tropidoderus childrenii, the Children's stick insect, was first described in 1833 by Gray.

Description
These relatively large stick insects generally measure about  in length and are native to Eastern Australia.

Generally, the female insect is a medium green color and closely resembles leaves, thus making it difficult to spot in the foliage.  A large, dark blue spot can be found on each hindwing at the base of the remigium and anal lobe. This dark spot is usually hidden when the wings are folded down. The nymphs also have a long yellow strip that runs down the center of their bodies which exactly matches the color of the leaf vein. The males can look very different, usually more slender and reddish-brown in color.

Life cycle
During adulthood the Children's stick insect mates more than once and females lays eggs its whole life as an adult. The males fly between trees in search for the females to mate with. the females are much larger and heavier than the males and tend to not fly very far or very often. Once they mate, the females will lay the small, oval, gray eggs that will drop to the leaf litter. From Winter to Autumn, (winter laid autumn hatched) the eggs will hatch, forming an army of baby stick insects.

Habitat
They usually live in areas where eucalyptus trees are prominent, as their main source of food is the leaves of various Gum or Eucalyptus trees.

Defense

When disturbed, the Children's stick insect will detach its hind legs from the foliage and repeatedly strike them together. Additionally, it will  flap its hindwings up and down, flashing the dark blue splotches hidden underneath. It has been shown in mantid species that actions like these described can startle and deter predators such as lizards and so it is believed this is the case in the stick insect as well. Furthermore, the Children's stick insect has the ability to drop a limb in order to escape a predator, similar to how lizards can drop their tail.

62,215,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type7,"Manuel Giner Miralles (Valencia, Spain, 27 December 1926 – Valencia, Spain, 9 May 2019) was a Spanish doctor, entrepreneur and politician.

Early elections
Giner was one of the founder members of the People's Alliance (AP) in the Valencian Community and was a member of the party's Provincial Executive Committee. As an AP member he was elected to the national parliament as a deputy for Valencia province at the 1982 General Election. However he resigned after one year in order to stand for election for Valencia Province to the Corts Valencianes, the reconstituted Valencian regional parliament in 1983. He was the lead AP candidate and therefore candidate for President of the Valencian Community but lost to the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) candidate Joan Lerma. In January 1986, following internal disagreements, he threatened to resign from the AP but remained in the party after the intervention of the AP leader Manuel Fraga. He coordinated the AP campaign for the June 1987 regional election and was re-elected as a regional deputy.

Expulsion from the Popular Alliance
The AP defeat in that election caused an internal crisis which had initially stemmed from disagreements over those nominated to contest the election for the party  Giner argued that some in the AP had not been satisfied with replacing him as regional head of the AP but had also wanted to remove him completely from the candidate list. Eventually he had been included on the list as the third candidate. He criticised the organisation of the AP in Valencia region and particularly the regional AP president Ignacio Gil Lázaro. Giner publicly implied that defecting to the Valencian Union (UV), a right wing regional party that had grown in strength in this period, was a possibility. When Gil Lázaro asked him to clarify his position, he responded by asking for a period of reflection. This led to his expulsion from AP, an action that he denounced as ""illegal"" and ""against the statutes of the AP."" He subsequently joined UV in September 1987 and although he did not contest the 1991 election, he returned to the Corts Valencianes at the 1995 election as a UV deputy, serving until 1999.

In 1967, before his career in politics, he was one of the founders of Grupo Hospitales Nisa, one of the leading companies in the Spanish private health sector. In 1972 he became Nisa's Chief Executive Officer until 1997. In 1998 Giner was named ""John Paul II, Family and Life Foundation"" chief. He was also CEO of Edifesa, a construction company, until his retirement in 2006 at age 80.

In January 2009, he was one of several former members of the Corts Valencianes who criticised the pension scheme for former members of the legislature as being inadequate.

55,216,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type7,"Barbara of Portugal (Maria Madalena Bárbara Xavier Leonor Teresa Antónia Josefa; 4 December 1711 – 27 August 1758) was an Infanta of Portugal, and a Queen of Spain by marriage to Ferdinand VI of Spain.

Life

Princess of Portugal
The marriage of King John V of Portugal and Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria remained childless for nearly three years. The king made a promise to God that if an heir to the throne was born, a great convent would be built as a sing of gratitude. On 4 December 1711, a daughter was finally born, and the king built the Convent of Mafra. The child was baptised Maria Madalena Bárbara Xavier Leonor Teresa Antónia Josefa, honouring a number of saints and relatives, and styled Princess of Brazil as the heir presumptive to the Portuguese throne. She was usually referred to as Bárbara or Maria Bárbara after Saint Barbara, the saint of her birthday, a name never used before among Portuguese royalty.

Two years later, Barbara's mother gave birth to a son, Pedro, and she ceased to be heir presumptive. Pedro died at the age of two, but by that time, the queen had already had another son, Joseph, and hence Barbara never became heir presumptive again.

Barbara had a fine education and loved music. A prodigiously talented keyboard player, she was the sole pupil of Domenico Scarlatti, the great harpsichordist and composer, from age 9 or 10 until 1757, when Scarlatti died, a year before her own death.

In 1725, Barbara was among the seventeen princesses seriously considered for marriage to king Louis XV of France, when the list of the original 99 had been reduced.  However, there were concerns about the perceived weak physical and mental health of her family as well as her young age, and in the end she was removed from the list.

Princess of Asturias
In 1729 at the age 18, Barbara married the future Ferdinand VI of Spain, two years her junior. Her brother Joseph married Ferdinand's half-sister, the Spanish Infanta Mariana Victoria, who had been rejected as a bride for Louis XV. The double marriage, known as the Exchange of the Princesses, was meant to repair the Portuguese-Spanish alliance. Scarlatti followed Barbara to Madrid after her marriage and remained with her, composing hundreds of harpsichord sonatas for her.

During their time as Prince and Princess of the Asturias, Ferdinand and Barbara became the target of the opposition known as the Spanish party, in parallel with Spain's deteriorating relations with Portugal. From 1733 until 1737 they were kept more or less under house arrest in their apartments, prevented from appearing in public and watched by the spies of Queen Elizabeth. This gave Barbara the time to deepen her relationship with Ferdinand, a timid person who suffered also from ill health.

Barbara was not considered beautiful by her contemporaries, and her homely looks were thought by observers to have caused her future husband a visible shock when he was first presented to her. However, 'Ferdinand the Learned' (as he was later known) became deeply attached to her, sharing her passion for music and soon becoming dependent on her for advice and support. When he ascended the Spanish throne as Ferdinand VI, the French ambassador noted ""it is rather Barbara who succeeds Elizabeth [Ferdinand's step-mother] than Ferdinand succeeding Philippe."" Barbara was well-educated, and in addition to her musical talents was adept at languages and was an avid reader on many varied subjects.

Queen of Spain
Upon their succession, Barbara was exposed to attempts to drive a political wedge between her and Ferdinand, engineered by, among others, supporters of the Queen Dowager, and she formed an alliance with three members of the Spanish party, who had been in opposition during the previous regime, Ensenada, Huescar and Carvajal. She thus secured the Spanish party as her supporters and obtained the dismissal of all power holders of the previous regime who threatened her influence over Ferdinand. Encouraged by Barbara, Ferdinand fired the minister Villarias, who was replaced by Carvajal, and in July 1747 the Queen Dowager was banished from court.

During her husband's reign, Barbara was to preside over magnificent parties and concerts at her favorite retreat, the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. However, in contrast to her predecessor as queen, Barbara did not like to flaunt her influence over her spouse and the government policy, and she made a moderately positive impression upon the public. She was not as self-assured, nor did she have as much political ambition as Elisabeth Farnese, and her policy focused mainly upon a friendly relationship between Spain and Portugal in cooperation with her father and the Portuguese ambassador Belmonte. 
Queen Barbara participated regularly in the affairs of state: the ministers, who respected her, presented to her all documents of state before they were given to the king, because: ""only she knows what ought either be said or hidden from the king"": she was the channel through which the ministers worked with the king, as it was she who advised them how to achieve the desired result from the king, and the ministers relied upon her for their work as, the British ambassador Benjamin Keene reported: ""She can sway him as she pleases, with as much power, but much less difficulty, than ever the Dowager did with the late King, his father."" In 1754, she was behind the fall of her previous ally Ensenada. Keene and Huascar presented the Queen with a paper implying that minister Ensenada was making puppets of the royal couple. They succeeded in convincing her to act against Ensenada, and in cooperation with Richard Wall and Huascar, Barbara convinced Ferdinand to exile Ensenada.

The couple produced no children who survived, with Barbara having a stillborn son in 1733. Barbara suffered from severe asthma for most of her life and in later years became overweight. She died at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, on the outskirts of Madrid on 27 August 1758. Her death was said to have broken her husband's heart.

Chase for the Nextel CupThe Šiauliai or Shavli Ghetto was a Jewish ghetto established in July 1941 by Nazi Germany in the city of Šiauliai (, Shavl) in Nazi-occupied Lithuania during the Holocaust. The ghetto comprised two areas – one in the Kaukazas suburb and one on Trakai Street. Both were liquidated by July 1944, and their inhabitants were killed or transferred to Nazi concentration camps. In 1939, one quarter of the population of Šiauliai was Jewish, about 8,000 persons. By the end of World War II, only about 500 Jews of the city had survived.

Before the war
Šiauliai was the second largest city in independent pre-war Lithuania, and its Jewish community, numbering 8,000 in 1939, was the second largest in the country. The city had elected a Jewish deputy mayor. Jews were involved in the manufacture of leather products, and there was a Jewish-owned shoe factory. Jews were also involved in the iron and chemical industries, and many worked as clerks, laborers, and craftsmen.

The Jewish community supported numerous cultural and social institutions and organizations. Among these were Yavneh, a religious secondary school, a Hebrew secondary school, an elementary school, and a kindergarten, as well as several Yiddish schools. There were 15 synagogues, a yeshiva, and two libraries.

Mass murders

After the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and before the arrival of the Germans in Lithuania, several hundred Jews from the city fled to Russia. German soldiers entered Šiauliai on 26 June 1941. Of the Jews who remained, several thousand were massacred by the Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators, both before the ghetto was established and thereafter.

During the first weeks of the Nazi occupation, about 8000 people were shot in the nearby Lieponiai forest near Kužiai after being forced to dig their own graves. In July 1941, the Germans moved 732 Jews and communists from the Šiauliai jail to the vicinity of Pročiūnai village, about  southeast from Šiauliai, and murdered them there. From 7–15 September 1941, about 1000 Jewish men, women and children from Šiauliai were killed in the Gubernija forest, about  northwest of the city.

Establishment
The German occupation authorities began preparations for a ghetto in Šiauliai at the beginning of July 1941. The Šiauliai city military commandant gave instructions to the new deputy mayor, Antanas Stankus, who had been put in charge of ""Jewish affairs"". Stankus set up a committee of Jewish notables to liaise with the Lithuanian authorities to relocate Jews. The first step was the registration of all Jewish residents – all the Jews in the city were required to register at the city government's office from 19–22 July.

At first, only one location, in the Kaukazas neighborhood, was selected for the ghetto. The area proved to be too small for the entire Jewish population, and additional Jews were transported to Žagarė. After Jewish protests, a second location between Ežeras and Trakai streets was chosen. When both areas housed approximately 3000 Jews each, the Jews petitioned for a third ghetto. The authorities promised an area in the Kalniukas neighborhood and gathered more Jews in the Village Traders’ Synagogue, the Jewish Home for the Elderly, and the Central Choral Synagogue. However, instead of being relocated to the third ghetto, the Jews were taken in groups of 200–300 to Lieponiai forest and shot. The last 500 Jews were shot in Bubiai and were buried in pits dug from clay.

Life in the ghetto
The resettlement was completed by 15 August. Between 4,000 and 5,000 Jews, including 1,500 from areas surrounding Šiauliai, were forced into the ghettos and were interned there. The Jewish committee was recognized as the Judenrat (Jewish Council) of the ghetto. The Germans conducted frequent Aktionen – massive killing sprees – to eliminate ""useless"" Jews. Gainful employment was perceived to provide security from these Aktionen. Approximately 600 Jews were employed in a nearby shoe factory, and another 600 in construction projects at the Zokniai airport. Others were employed in workshops in the city tanning and processing leather, producing items such as gloves and brushes. Some Jews were transferred to labor camps in the surrounding areas to provide labor force for specific projects, mainly extracting peat from peat bogs. A group of 125 Jews was transferred to Linkaičiai, where they worked in a weapons and artillery workshop.

The period from around January 1942 to September 1943, was a ""quiet period"" without major massacres. During that time the Jews in the ghetto established several cultural and educational organizations, including Hechalutz and Beitar. On 26–27 May 1942, the Germans conducted a census within the Generalbezirk Litauen, including the Šiauliai Ghetto. The census counted at least 4,665 Jews in the ghetto, but many avoided the census as they believed it to be a ruse in preparation for another Aktion.  
On 30 August 1942, several Jews were found smuggling food into the ghetto. The Germans told the Judenrat to select 50 Jews for execution. The members of the Judenrat refused and instead offered themselves. The sentence was commuted and one food smuggler was hanged.

Liquidation

On June 21, 1943, Heinrich Himmler issued an order to liquidate all ghettos and transfer remaining Jews to concentration camps. The Šiauliai Ghetto was reorganized into a concentration camp, an exterior camp (Außenlager) of the Kaunas concentration camp (Kaunas Ghetto) under jurisdiction of the SS. At the time, the ghetto had five work camps: Zokniai airport (500 Jews), Linkaičiai weapon workshop (250 Jews), Pavenčiai sugar factory (250 Jews), A.B.A. military clothing workshop (800 Jews), Akmenė brick factory (250 Jews) and Daugėliai brick factory (250 Jews). Territorial Commissioner (Gebietskommissar) Hans Gewecke was replaced by SS-Oberscharführer Hermann Schlöf on 1 October 1943 as commander of the ghetto.

The original Kaukazas neighborhood ghetto site was liquidated in mid-October 1943. On November 5, 1943, SS troops and a company from the Russian Liberation Army seized and transported 574 children under the age of 13, 191 elderly, 26 disabled, and 4 women to Auschwitz concentration camp.

Later, as Germany was losing the war, the Nazis started closing down work camps and transferring the Jews into the ghetto. In July 1944, the Germans, retreating from the advancing Russian army, transferred remaining ghetto residents to the concentration camps of Stutthof and Dachau in Germany. Of the total number of Jews interned, only a few hundred managed by various means to escape death. On 15 July 1944, the final liquidation of the Šiauliai ghetto began. Several thousand Jews were deported in four large groups to the Stutthof concentration camp. 

No more than 500 people were identified as survivors of the Šiauliai Ghetto after the war.

Documentation
A diary kept by Eliezer Yerushalmi, a teacher and a member of the ghetto's Judenrat, was published in Hebrew in 1950 by Yad Vashem. A portion of this diary was included in the Black Book. Based on the May 1942 census, lists of the names of the Kaukazas and Ežero-Trakų ghetto prisoners, as well as Jews who stayed outside the ghetto, were published by the Vilna Gaon Jewish State Museum in 2002.

2011 SinglesDoggoLingo, also referred to as doggotalk, woof, bork, and dog-speak, is an Internet language that is created from word conversion, meme lexicon, and onomatopoeia. Emerging in the 2010s, DoggoLingo is implied to be a dog's own idiom, and is presented as what humans have long believed goes on in the canine brain. Elyse Graham, assistant professor at Stony Brook University, describes DoggoLingo as ""upbeat, joyful, and clueless in a relentlessly friendly way"".

Structure 
DoggoLingo appends various diminutive suffixes ""-o"", ""-er"", ""-ino"" to existing English words (e.g. dog turns into doggo, pup turns into pupper,) as well as DoggoLingo words that have been created (e.g. pupper turns into pupperino, bork turns into borker). DoggoLingo relies heavily upon onomatopoeia: Words such as blep, blop and mlem describe the action of a dog sticking out its tongue; bork, boof, woof describe the various canine barking sounds. A dog with a fluffy coat may be called a floof or a fluff. DoggoLingo follows a similar rudimentary style to create its verbs (e.g. doin me a in place of present participles with the speaker as object, such as doin me a scare ""scaring me"") and adjectives (e.g. heckin in place of degree modifiers such as extremely). 'Heck' is frequently used in place of more conventional expletives. Some words also come from eye dialect spellings of English words, such as fren ""friend"".

Origin 
DoggoLingo emerged in the 2010s, but its exact origin is unknown. Various social media accounts such as WeRateDogs (Twitter), Dogspotting (Facebook), as well as social news aggregation and imageboard websites like 4chan, Reddit, or Tumblr have aided in popularizing the use of DoggoLingo by consistently using or hosting content that uses the lingo on their Internet pages. In 2014, the Dogspotting Facebook account gained popularity, especially in Australia where coincidentally adding ""-o"" to the end of words is also a feature of Australian slang. Usage of DoggoLingo peaked around 2017.

Examples

Other animals 
Some other animals are referred to differently in DoggoLingo: One would refer to a snake as snek or danger noodle, a human being as hooman, a cat as catto (cf. doggo), a bird as birb etc.

Internet fan groups for other animals have adopted many of the conventions of DoggoLingo for their own related languages for their preferred animals (like Posso or Poss-speak for opossums). Lolcats may be a precursor to DoggoLingo. Many aspects of DoggoLingo have also been adopted into the slang terminology of the furry fandom, called “furspeech”.

Location
The Catholic parish of Kilmurry McMahon / Labasheeda is bounded on the south by the Shannon Estuary and by the parishes of Kilmihil on the north, Killimer on the west and  Coolmeen (Kilfidane) on the east. It is  west of Ennis. The name derives its name from the church dedicated to Our Lady. The suffix, McMahon, to distinguish it from other Kilmurrys in the county, came from the McMahon clan, who had their main residence at Clonderlaw Castle.

The Catholic parish, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe, combines the former parishes of Kilmurry McMahon and Killofin.
The population has declined from 7,932 in 1831 to 650 in 2014.
The parish has two holy wells, Tullyrcrine well and Mountshannon well.

There are two villages in the parish, Labasheeda and Knock.

Education
There are two primary schools in the parish, Kilmurry McMahon National School and Labasheeda National School. In 2014, Tullycrine National School and Drumdigus National School amalgamated to form Kilmurry McMahon National School, which is located on the site of the old Drumdigus National School. Another primary school at Kilkerin closed in the middle of the last century and has since been demolished.

Sport and leisure
Gaelic football is played in the parish by Shannon Gaels, with its football pitch located in Ballyguiry about 1 km from Clonderlaw Bay along the R473 Clarecastle-Kilrush road. The club has won the Clare Senior Football Championship three times in its history, most recently in 1971, as well as a number of underage titles.

St Mary's Athletic Club also uses this facility.

Religion
There are two Roman Catholic churches in the parish. St. Ciarán's Church is located in the village of Labasheeda while St. Mary's Church is located in the townland of Drumdigus.
The former church in the village of Labasheeda is now used as a Community Centre having been previously owned by Shannon Development. A Church of Ireland church was located in the graveyard at Kilmurry East but was demolished in 1965. There is also a graveyard in Kilofin, while there is a famine grave located in the townland of Carrowniska South. There is also a children's grave called Líos na Leanaí, in the townland of Tullycreen Lower, from an era when the doctrine of the Church forbade the burial of unbaptised children on consecrated ground.

Townlands
Townlands of the civil parish of Kilmurry-Clonderalaw are Ballycurraun, Binvoran, Bleanmore, Breaghva, Carrowbane, Carrowniska North, Carrowniska South, Cassarnagh, Clonderalaw, Cross Beg, Cross More, Derreen, Derrybrick, Derrynalecka, Drumdigus, Kilmore, Kilmurry East, Kilmurry West, Kinlea, Knock, Knockaderreen, Knocknahooan, Lisheenydeen, Prospect, Tullycreen Lower and Tullycreen Upper.

27,221,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type7,"Liostenogaster vechti is a type of eusocial hover wasp within the family Vespidae. They are typically brown and yellow in color and are considered a passive aggressive species. Their stings are less painful to humans than other social wasps, and they engage in associative nest foundation. They are mostly found on the Malaysian peninsula and are known for living in large clusters of small ring-shaped nests.

Taxonomy and phylogeny 

Liostenogaster vechti was first classified by Stefano Turillazzi in 1988. These wasps are part of the subfamily Stenogastrinae and are often referred to as hover wasps due to their manner of flying. Stenogastrinae has many other groups that are distributed across the Oriental region, but the species most closely associated with L. vechti is L. flavolineata due to similar coloring, behavioral patterns, and the similar locations of the two species.

Description and identification 
The adult females are 14 to 16 mm in length with dark brown coloring and yellow markings all over the body. The abdomen has brown and yellow stripes with the tip being mostly dark brown, and the legs are typically lighter at the bottom and browner near the top. Their mandibles are also yellow and each have three teeth (tridentate) which are not yellow. The antennae are partially dark brown and the eyes are dark brown and hairless unlike the hairy eyes of L. flavolineata. The top of the thorax is usually dark brown with the rest of the thorax having yellow and brown intermediate patches, and the petiole (slender stalk connecting the abdomen to the thorax) is usually a reddish brown. They also have two sets of wings, two posterior and anterior.

The adult males look very similar to the females. They have about the same body length, and the main differences include their antennae being completely dark brown, and having hair on the broad yellow plate (clypeus) at the front of their heads. They have more hair in other places as well. Also, their upper hind limbs (femora) on their median legs are brown with a thin, long, yellow stripe. Lastly, the aedeagus (reproductive organ which is used to secrete sperm) is flattened and inflated at the apex.

Habitat and distribution 
Along with most other members of the Stenogastrinae, L. vechti are only located in Southeast Asian rainforests. These wasps along with L. flavolineata are mostly distributed in the Malaysian peninsula. Their nests are located in large clusters and are usually found on flat, vertical, or horizontal substrates.

Colony cycle 
Colonies are often founded by a group of L. vechti females using what is known as associative foundation. They begin by constructing small nests in the center, and eventually other wasps join the colony and build nests around the initial central one. The nests last for multiple years, and colonies grow and contain up to 600 nests or more. Temperature does not play a serious limiting factor in the lives of these wasps, and there is no particular season during which the colonies of these wasps are not present and active. However, brood rearing and reproduction is more likely to occur during the dry season, and the population of the nest tends to increase during that time as well, although brood rearing and reproduction also occurs during the wet season.

Nests are sometimes destroyed by predators or by other environmental factors such as floods and earth slides, but new nests are continually built around the old nests. Each nest usually contains relatively few individuals (usually no more than 10) and there are usually more females than males. There is typically one dominant reproductive female per nest, and after her daughters mature, they stay with their mother in her nest for a short while and engage in nest defense, brood care, or foraging activities. After this period ends, daughters often leave and join other colonies. Occasionally, dominant females are usurped by other visiting dominants. A new reproductive female may arrive, fight the current dominant female, and take over the nest if she (the
newcomer) wins.

Nests

Nest building 
L. vechti build their nests in sheltered areas on flat, vertical, or horizontal surfaces (such as on the faces of overhanging rocks). They begin by building cells one next to the other in a row by using bits of vegetation. Once they have finished the initial row, they will often build a second row atop the first one and possibly even a third row if conditions are especially crowded. The wasps occasionally build nests that form a complete ring which have no more than 40 cells in one row, but usually the nests resemble an open ring with the open cells facing the center. This has caused the nests to be characterized as ""bracket-like"" or ""horseshoe-like."" The cells also face slightly downward to prevent raindrops from landing inside of the nests, and the nests usually contain a couple of protruding points which the wasps use as locations upon which to land. Most nests are small, but the nests are built in clusters that range from only having a few nests to containing hundreds.

Nests are also built to take advantage of camouflage and concealment techniques to avoid predation. Old nests that are no longer used are not completely torn down or abandoned but combined with other functioning nests to form a pattern that often contributes to predator confusion.

Colony behavior 
At sunrise, the population of wasps currently on the nest drops to around 60%. This percentage remains about the same throughout the day as different wasps return and leave for various reasons, and the number increases to about 90% as night falls. However, the number never reaches 100% because some individuals do not return during the night.

When on the nest, the majority of the wasps spend their time resting. This posture usually includes holding the abdomen to one side, and individuals will often lie on top of each other while resting. Most activity seems to be concentrated in the middle of the day, including egg-laying and abdominal pap collection.

Throughout the day, some wasps return to their own nests, while others appear to ""visit"" or ""inspect"" other nests. They do this by either approaching other nests, touching other nests, or directly landing on the nests. Responses to these visitors by wasps that actually reside on these nests range from ignoring the newcomers, accepting the newcomers, or threatening and attacking the intruders. Falling fights and other more aggressive defensive maneuvers are more frequent on nests located in the center of the clusters. This suggests that while all the nests are
defended, central nests are defended more aggressively, even against visitors.

Spatial arrangement 
Clusters are often built in an oval shape starting from the center. The center is the most coveted space, so the nests tend to be more concentrated and often smaller and older in these areas. These central nests are also more likely to have completely closed rings rather than open rings. Many nests on the periphery are larger, younger, and contain more cells, and foundations are also mainly found near the peripheries. Also, because clusters last for more than one year and some nests are destroyed during that time, signs of older nests are also more concentrated near the middle.

Costs and benefits of group living 
Unlike wasps in the subfamily Polistinae, Stenogastrinae are unable to construct peduncles for their nests. Being forced to choose sites with already made suspensions severely limits their options for suitable nesting sites. This also provides a reasonable explanation for why wasps belonging to this family tend to nest in clusters. When one suitable site is located, many wasps can benefit from the same site.

However, there are obvious costs to group living as well. The larger the cluster, the more visible the cluster becomes and the more obvious it is to predators. While the nests do tend to blend in well with the surrounding environment, predators notice the nests, return repeatedly to the same clusters, and use them as a ready food source.

Also, the nests located near the periphery are more likely to be attacked than the ones in the center which are usually completely surrounded by other nests. This is an example of the selfish herd theory and demonstrates how individuals may cluster together for protection against predators, but the ones in the middle tend to be safer than those on the outside. However, each colony is more prone to attack if the colony next to it is attacked. This is an example of the attacked neighbor risk and reduces some of the benefit gained by participating in selfish herd tactics.

Reproduction

Egg-laying 
As is characteristic of Stenogastrinae, L. vechti secrete a type of gelatinous substance (which is produced by the Dufour’s gland) from their abdomens, which they use to care for the offspring and to lay their eggs. The females collect the pap with their front legs and then hold it in their mouths while they lay eggs, and pap collection is performed before and after each egg is laid.

Egg-laying is done by bringing the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front legs up and open and appears to use them to touch her abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36 mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16 mm.

Development 
L. vechti go through four larval instars (developmental stages), with possibly a 5th initial instar, and the total developmental period lasts over 100 days. As the larvae mature, they develop salivary glands, and afterwards they enter a pupal stage which can last for over 36 days. After individuals emerge from their cells, they spend a few days residing on their nests before engaging in normal nest behavior such as nest defense, or before becoming foragers and retrieving food for the colony.

Genetic relatedness 
Like most hover wasps, L. vechti reproductive females mate singly and are therefore more closely related to the brood than any of the other nestmates are. This is especially true considering that most of the daughters leave the nest, and the current nestmates are often not related to the queen.

Behavior

Feeding 
L. vechti frequently request trophallaxis from other members within their colonies. This behavior is most exhibited whenever a forager returns to the colony. A fellow colony member may solicit food from the individual in a variety of ways. The solicitor may approach the forager and bite her on her clypeus or her mouthparts. The two wasps may also push their heads against each other as if they are fighting. While this happens, they either do not move their antennae or hold them quivering to one side, and their abdomens are pointed downwards slightly. A wasp might also solicit food by rubbing the sides of the other individual's head with her front legs and flapping her wings vigorously. Trophallaxis usually happens too quickly to be observed, and a forager will often leave the nest a few seconds after arriving because she is often rushed by many wasps at the same time. Foragers also often return with insects (such as ants or termites) which they have chewed up and feed to the larvae.

Signaling 
Nestmate recognition and the establishment of reproductive status and dominance are often maintained through facial markings and chemical signaling. The bodies of L. vechti are covered by a mixture of cuticular lipids and long hydrocarbons. Females with ovarian development have much more of a particular hydrocarbon on their cuticles than females with undeveloped ovaries. This hydrocarbon appears to be a type of fertility signal which fertilized females use to show their status.

The size of the brown facial markings on the heads of females also serves as a visual cue for members of the colony and serves as a badge of higher ranking status and reproductive status. Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries. These visual cues help other wasps to not only determine if a wasp is of the same species, but also to determine what to do and how to distribute themselves around the nests. Visiting females that lack these brown visual marks are more likely to be accepted into foreign nests. Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these distinctive markings in order to maintain a control system within the nest.

Division of labor
Each individual nest usually contains one dominant female with well-developed ovaries. This female spends the majority of time on the nest and engages in egg-laying and abdominal pap collection. Other females act as foragers and spend most of their time away from the nest. These females are usually not fertilized and have very poor ovarian development.

Dominance 
The most acts of dominance are usually performed by females with the highest ovarian indices. They will sometimes bite a subordinate’s face and sometimes flap their wings. The subordinate will often lower its head, cease voluntary movement, and sometimes even release a drop of liquid from its abdomen as a deferential act. The dominant wasp ceases movement of her own
antennae and may or may not accept the drop.

Fighting 
When disputes occur within the nests, individuals may fight each other to determine dominance. Two wasps may engage in this activity by holding their antennae out-stretched, grasping each other, and falling from the nest. The wasps never actually hit the ground. Instead they separate in mid-air, return to the nest, and repeat this process until a winner is determined. This behavior is especially likely in the event that a stranger attempts to take over a nest while the dominant female is away. When the dominant female returns, she will ""fight"" this individual, often for several hours and possibly even a couple days, to determine who will be in charge of the nest.

Predators and defense 
When an individual of L. vechti feels threatened, it will assume a menacing stance by bending its abdomen to one side and pointing the tip in the direction of its challenger. It does this so that it is prepared to sting its opponent if necessary and thrust its abdomen toward the intruder in what is known as an abdominal slap.

The main predators of these wasps are hornets (especially Vespa tropica), ichneumonid flies, and ants. The hornets attack and damage the nests by ripping the cells apart with their mandibles and then extracting portions of the brood. Raided nests can easily be identified by locating cells that have been ripped or torn. When a hornet or other flying predator approaches, the wasps engage in aerial attacks by throwing themselves into the air in the direction of the potential danger. They actually engage in this behavior very frequently and do so in response to any insect of similar size to hornets that approaches the nests in a questionable manner. When ants approach or invade the nests, the wasps will either grab the ants and drag them away from the nests, or, if the ants are especially large, the wasps will first assume a defensive posture, seize the ants, and then purposely fall out of the nests to ensure the ants are removed. Spiders may also prey on these wasps, but they are much more likely to catch solitary individuals away from the nest.

Venom 
Although they have effective stingers, these wasps and other members of Stenogastrinae are typically passive aggressive. Their stings are less painful for humans than those of many other social wasps, and often when faced with a large threat, these wasps will simply fall passively out of their nests. This behavior actually makes it harder for the potential predator to determine the location of the nest.

Aethelric was one of the sons of Ida of Bernicia, founder of the kingdom. During his reign the Bernicians met the Britons in three important battles, the first on the offensive, the others on the defensive.

He was the father of Æthelfrith, who was the first monarch to rule both Bernicia and Deira, the two constituent parts of what came to be considered Northumbria.

Main characters

Chris

Chris (played by Tyler James Williams), is the ambitious, normal, responsible, intelligent, and kind-hearted, but unlucky, unpopular, untalented, nonathletic, underachieving, hapless, awkward, nerdy, vulnerable and mischievous eldest child and protagonist of the series. He wishes he was more like his younger brother, Drew. Regardless of whether Chris possesses any positive traits, he's certainly never treated as if he does (being disliked by the opposite race, unlike his siblings). He tries hard to fit in with his peers but often finds himself a victim of circumstance. Chris is bullied and beat up at school (with little protection obtained from teachers or faculty members), tortured by his sister, humiliated by his brother, victimized by the racist teaching staff, rejected by girls (most of whom prefer Drew), slandered by his neighbors, ignored by his schoolmates, robbed by neighborhood thugs, is underpaid at work, and receives tough love from his mother and distressing treatment from his father. As the eldest child, he is often put in charge of his younger siblings, but they usually disobey him and he usually has to take the blame for them. Next to all this, Chris is always the butt of the last jokes on each show. People just seem to hate him for inexplicable reasons. His luck does improve as the series progresses. One of his talents is playing Asteroids and the other is calling basketball games. As he gets older, Chris becomes interested in stand-up comedy and begins telling jokes in school. At the end of the series – after being told that he has to repeat the tenth grade for constantly being late for school – he drops out and gets his GED, though his narrator dropped out due to bullying. He later grows up to be a rich and famous comedian.

Julius

Julius (played by Terry Crews), based on Chris Rock's father, is Rochelle's cheap, frugal, worrisome, levelheaded, and devoted husband and the father of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. He is known for his extreme cheapness and taking the easy way out when it comes to purchasing essential items for his family (such as by using food-stamps and buying store-brands). Julius' cheapness is also exhibited by how he uses duct tape to fix anything and everything broken in the house. He has even been shown to memorize the price of nearly every object in his family's possession, shouting it out loud when such an item has been wasted or ruined. One of his most famous character attributes is bargaining his way out of having to pay full price for an item. He coddles Tonya and is more likely than his wife to give her what she wants, and will react with a lecture every time one of his children considers quitting or asks him about receiving money. Said lectures having been known to last for hours on end and encourage his kids to avoid bringing up such subjects around him. Julius is also shown to be a workaholic, accepting any job offer he receives. It is implied that Julius can understand Chinese but cannot speak it due to the fact that when he communicates with Mr. Fong, (who speaks in  Chinese towards him) he is able to respond back. Whenever Chris has a problem, he goes to Julius, who gives him advice in a confusing manner. Once, Chris remarked that even though he didn't understand what his father said, it made him feel better anyway. He dies in 1988.

Rochelle

Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold) is Julius' very humorously cheeky wife and is the strict mother of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. She is a narcissistic woman who frequently becomes apprehensive over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter (such as her kids having babies or selling drugs). She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have. She uses the comebacks to ensure that they do not end up performing a crime or great misdeed of some sort; she also fears that they may wind up as street criminals or teenage parents. The narrator describes her as a ""Ghetto Snob"", likely because of her cautious behavior towards the way her family is perceived in public. She shares loving moments with her children. She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles, which often calm her, and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason. She is also noted for getting a job, and then quitting whenever she has a problem with it. Rochelle's famous catchphrase that refers to this running gag is: ""I don't need this, my man has two jobs!"" This expresses her reliance on Julius's two jobs as an excuse to resign and be comfortable at home. She is very judgmental towards Julius when it comes to their marriage. This can be seen in the episodes where she starts to think that Julius will leave her for a white woman or finds something which leads her to believe that Julius is having an affair. She sometimes disagrees to Julius' methods about being cheap, like when they celebrated Kwanzaa instead of Christmas. Julius believes that this method is an effective way to save money for more important things rather than materialistic items. There are times where Rochelle understands Julius's behavior, like in the episode where he got a second job in order to earn more money for the family. However, Rochelle eventually developed second thoughts about the situation, for she believed that Julius was actually throwing money away. In the final season of the series, Rochelle works as a beautician at Nessa's Beauty Salon, where in previous seasons she would often get her hair done. She also gossips with her friend and owner of the salon, Vanessa (Jackee Harry) and the other workers. Another running gag about her is that she regularly threatens her children with impossible physical damages but never hits them. The only time she takes them into a room saying ""we need to talk"" is when she disciplines the children.

Drew

Drew (played by Tequan Richmond) is Chris's popular, lucky, talented, athletic, academic, and handsome younger brother. As opposed to the malicious rejection and harassment Chris receives from his peers, Drew is idolized above all of his classmates. His supreme charm earned him a multitude of girlfriends in the past. Secretly, Chris envies the limitless amount of luck and talent possessed by his younger brother, who appears slightly older than he does. Drew's height as opposed to that of Chris provides his elder brother with a number of disadvantages. Incredibly, Drew looks up to Chris and envies all the responsibility and trust their parents give him. Highly athletic, Drew loves hockey and idolizes Wayne Gretzky. He is also shown to be interested in magic and karate. Drew also has the talent of copying things he sees off of television, especially karate movies. He becomes more responsible and more hardworking as the series progresses. ""Wasn't Me"" is a familiar catchphrase of his, often to get himself out of any possible trouble he is sure he had nothing to do with. In one episode, the narrator even claims that this was his first phrase as a baby. This was first introduced in the Pilot episode.

Tonya

Tonya (played by Imani Hakim) is Chris and Drew's spoiled and obnoxious younger sister. She is a smart-mouthed, and shrewd little girl who enjoys getting her brothers in trouble by whining to her parents about things they never actually did, and Julius and Rochelle always believe her. However, in the third and fourth seasons, she tends to hold a soft spot for Drew and Chris (when Chris got thrown out of the house, she admitted she doesn't want him gone and she and Drew try to rethink Chris's and her mother's decisions) by charging money to keep her mouth shut if they do something wrong (particularly to Chris), and sometimes hangs around Drew. Billy Ocean is her favorite entertainer (though later on she adopts a fondness for Danny Glover), and telling by the way Tonya believes that he originally was responsible for the invention of the Moonwalk instead of Michael Jackson, she might not like to believe what she does not want to believe. Julius over-indulges Tonya and is usually the parent apt to give her what she wants, whereas Rochelle is normally not afraid to not provide Tonya with one of her desires if it is for something she is unwilling to give to her daughter, and worries that one mistake in raising her will be linked to her being pregnant one day, and she ""ain't raisin' no babies"". She is very attractive, and is usually given nice gifts from the neighborhood kids; for example, James (one of her admirers) bought her a car in one episode.

Greg

Vincent Martella as Gregory ""Greg"" Wuliger, Chris's weird, nerdy, and anxious best friend. He is one of the only kids at Corleone Junior High who doesn't hate Chris. He himself is almost as unpopular as Chris. Chris always comes to Greg for advice, even though Greg is usually terrible at coming up with solutions. Despite being Chris' best and only friend, Greg is always quick to abandon Chris when bullies come in order to save himself and also has disagreements with him from time to time. On top of being a good student, Greg also has a series of odd quirks (such as going to bed dressed as different superheroes and dressing as a car racer after learning Chris bought a car), but considers himself cool and nice. He has a book about almost everything in his locker. He is an only child and is of Italian and Swedish descent. His mom married his dad because she lost a bet but ran off with his uncle Patrick Wuliger, who later had a gender change. After graduating from Corleone, Greg got a scholarship when he went to the Bronx Academy, whereas Chris went to Tattaglia in Season 4, but got kicked out due to poor grades after he adopted` a tougher image. He later transferred to Tattaglia and the two continue their friendship. Although his father was seen in one episode his mother is never actually seen. Greg's catch phrase is ""You're so in there"". He was absent from only two episodes in the entire series. In the series finale Caruso subjects Greg to bullying for the rest of his school life.

The Narrator
Chris Rock as The Narrator (voice), a sarcastic older Chris looking back at his youth, like that of The Wonder Years. His narration is lots the opposite of what other characters say. The Narrator also mentions his disdain for then-president George W. Bush and for singer Bobby Brown as he frequently says sarcastic things about them. For instance in one episode the narrator talks how Greg has gone from bad to worse like ""America under Bush"". He also states things like ""who do you have to break up with to end up with Bobby Brown?"" He also states that Bobby Brown perhaps dislikes him back, such as when he thinks Bobby Brown changed the channel after watching one of the situations of the show.

Recurring characters

Bed-Stuy residents
 Mike Estime as Risky, a street dealer who sells items that are always bootlegged or stolen by him. His real name is Richard. Whenever he appears, a chorus of people whispering ""Risky!"" is heard in the background in the early episodes. He later works at Manny's barbershop. He also tried working with Julius for a night, but found the job not be as exciting as he hoped for, and then quit working with Julius to return selling his illegal goods.
 Antonio Fargas as Doc Harris, the local grocery store owner. Chris later works for Doc. He is kind to Chris and gives him advice. When Chris is unable to work, Drew fills in for him. In addition to Doc, Fargas also played Mr. Harris, a butcher who, on Halloween, dresses as a pimp named ""Sweet Tooth"" and takes children's candy.
 Todd Bridges as ""Monk"", Doc's nephew and former U.S. Armed Forces member who manages the store when his uncle is away. Monk is a severely paranoid Vietnam veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Monk always wears a beret and surplus military clothing, and is married to a Korean American woman who works at the neighborhood beauty salon. In Episode 14 of Season 2, the Narrator says that Monk's real name is ""Jimmy"".
 Kevontay Jackson as Jerome, Chris' only true friend aside from Greg. A dimwitted, older teenager in the neighborhood who frequently greets Chris with ""Lemme hold a dollar"" to which Chris almost always complies. He'll sometimes ask for a dollar just out of boredom. He nicknames Chris ""li'l dude from across the street"", or simply ""li'l dude"". In Jerome's first appearances on the series, he is a predatory, minor villain but that idea is soon abandoned and subsequent appearances portray him as a much friendlier person. Chris soon finds him becoming an unlikely friend, and on occasion, Chris will go to him when in need of some useful teenage advice, advice that he is only too happy to give – as soon as Chris gives him the dollar he asks for. The family once caught him breaking into their apartment with a credit card. Despite all of this, he does display genuine concern for Chris when he needs him.
 Ernest Lee Thomas as Mr. Omar, a womanizing funeral director, who rents an upstairs room in the family's building. He is seen with a different newly widowed woman for almost every appearance he makes. He claims just to be consoling these attractive women in their time of grief. He frequently says ""Tragic! Tragic!"". He also frequently requests to ""borrow"" things and takes advantage of Rochelle's need to keep up appearances to the chagrin of Julius. For example, he uses their phone and racks up a huge phone bill, invites himself to dinner, and even borrows his way into a Thanksgiving dinner invitation.
 Jeris Lee Poindexter as ""Kill Moves"", an insane, senile, homeless man who practices martial arts and at one point teaches Drew some karate moves. His real name is Edgar Devereaux. Kill Moves' mother is actually a millionaire and lives in the affluent Upper East Side, but he prefers to live freely on the streets. After being laid off by Ronald Reagan (he was in the Air Force, and got fired when Reagan introduced budget cuts) he had a breakdown, but he nevertheless sometimes reveals himself to be highly intelligent and cultured. In his first appearance, he is named Mr. Jackson. He occasionally gives Chris a hard time, for example when Chris is collecting empty cans for a school project, Kill Moves appears in trash bins before Chris can even run to them and leaves no cans for Chris.
 Blake Hightower as James, a 12-year-old neighborhood kid. James is flirty towards Tonya and wishes to have a relationship with her. He hangs alongside with the other supporting male characters at Manny's barbershop. The adult males treat James like he is their equal although he is a child. Another time, Chris was forced to volunteer to be a ""Brother from Another Mother"" for the sake of the school, and the child he mentors turns out to be James. Chris learns that James' real name is Cleavon Barris.
 Aree Davis as Keisha Ridenhour, the girl next door and Chris's dream girl, who he unfortunately catches kissing Chris' younger brother Drew. In season 2, Keisha moved away to Compton, believing it to be a crime-free city.
 Keesha Sharp as Sheila Ridenhour, Keisha's mother and a good friend of Rochelle's. Julius usually feels uncomfortable around her because she's an attractive woman. Sharp however left after nine episodes to play the role of Monica on Girlfriends.
 Paige Hurd as Tasha Clarkson, the girl who moves in next door into Keisha's old house and is her replacement in season 2. Chris is in love with her but she wants to keep their relationship platonic. She dated and dumped him near the end of Season 4, due to Chris believing her to clingy and slightly demanding as she constantly wanted to do the things she wants to do together. According to Chris, she is the only girl who doesn't hate him. She seems to have a slightly promiscuous side to her, and has also expressed attraction to bad boy types – something Chris is not.
 Whoopi as Louise Clarkson, the despicable and nosy next door neighbor and Tasha's maternal grandmother. She insults Chris because she believes that he wants to sleep with her granddaughter, and calls him a ""cock-eyed hooligan"" and ""nappy headed"" and infuriates Rochelle due to her being chief of the Neighborhood Watch for not being responsible. She only appears in two episodes of season two.
 Tisha Campbell as Peaches Clarkson, Louise's daughter and Tasha's mother. Peaches is very loud, ignorant and eccentric. She is an ex-con who befriends Rochelle in her first appearance. She also dates Malvo during her later appearances. She is also a kindhearted person despite her bad past.
 Jackée as Vanessa, Rochelle's bubbly, wise-cracking best friend and the gossipy owner of the local beauty salon after winning the lottery and buying it from Pam. She has dated Kill Moves and Rochelle's brother, Michael.
 Tasia Sherel as Pam, co-owner of the beauty salon. In season 4, it is stated that Pam sold her share of the salon to Vanessa. Rochelle takes Pam's place as the salon's manager. In the series finale, she returns once again to the beauty salon and it's constantly implied that she's rich and greedy, despite the fact that she asked Julius to give her $25 and said that ""the best part about being rich, is that she doesn't owe any money to anyone"". When asked her again for his $25, she pretends that she forgot about it and that she doesn't have any money despite that there's a cash register in front of her.
 J. B. Smoove as Manny, the local owner of the barbershop who appeared in season 3. He is always shown giving helpful advice and joking around. He says that his real name is Lester but he changed his name to Manny so he didn't have to change the sign on the shop. In the fourth season, it is said that Manny moved away to Detroit. Smoove left to join the cast of 'Til Death.
 Jazz Raycole as Lisa Patterson, a neighborhood girl. She threw a Halloween party in season 1. Chris briefly developed a crush on her when she danced with him after being rejected by Keisha. She later appeared in season 3 having a spin the bottle party that Chris wants to get into with Tasha.
 Jim Lau as Mr. Fong, the owner of the Chinese restaurant where Chris works briefly after quitting Doc's. Abusive and exploitative, he gave Chris a very hard time, shows no sympathy for Chris's problems, he gets more demanding towards Chris, even if he doesn't work for him anymore. He constantly calls Chris ""Lionel Richie"". He is first seen trying to operate the restaurant out of the family's upstairs room.
 Ricky Harris as Malvo, a petty criminal who robs Chris at Doc's and threatens to kill him if he identifies him. Later, after he gets out of jail, he forces Chris to chain-snatch a gold medallion. When Chris refuses, Julius saves Chris by threatening to beat up and possibly kill Malvo if he goes near Chris. After he gets out of jail again, he enlists Chris to help him go back to high school. Soon after that, he becomes Chris' friend, but manages still go on as a thief. He begins going out with Tasha's mother Peaches. They met at the parole office that they shared. 
 Myzel Robinson as Fat Mike, a neighborhood kid who protects Chris from local thugs and makes friends with him. In ""Everybody Hates a Part-time Job"" he buys the last leather jacket in the store, that Chris had been hoping to buy.

Corleone Junior High School/Tattaglia High School staff and students
 Travis T. Flory as Joey Caruso, the Irish-Italian-American, racist school bully who routinely picks on Chris, although he is surprisingly fond of African-American culture. Since the beginning of the show, he mostly picked and beat up Chris for no good reason, to which surprisingly he never got suspended or caught for, possibly for just being white. He is the main antagonist of the series. In each episode, he refers to Chris by a different nickname such as ""Satchmo"", ""Kareem"", ""Tito"" or ""Cornbread"", even at one point calling him the n-word and frequently gives cruel gifts to Chris. In the series finale, it is revealed that Caruso actually admires Chris and the only reason he has picked on Chris in school is because he has been jealous of his determination and achievement and had crushed Chris's spirit only so he himself would not feel inferior.
 Jacqueline Mazarella as Ms. Vivian Morello, Chris' beautiful but naively racist teacher, and later his high school principal. Due to her apparent attraction to Black men, she holds a soft spot for Chris and tries to support him at every opportunity (such as giving him a Valentine's Day card out of sympathy, or giving him advice on running for the class president). In her efforts to be supportive, however, she makes statements or uses analogies that come off as racist, even though she might not realize that – such as saying that ""black people"" must wake up and work up fields before sunrise, that they have tendencies towards vandalism, criminality and drugs, that they often make use of lies and blackmail to rise in life, that Chris has no father and his mother is crack-addicted, and when Chris tries to tell her the truth, she assumes Chris is lying because ""he is on drugs"" – most of which Chris tolerates. However, in ""Everybody Hates Graduation"", she finally realizes Chris' lifestyle, but believed that Chris lied, despite her being the one who made up all that stuff about Chris. In Chris Rock's narration often consists of him wanting to physically hurt her (""smack her upside the head with a brick"") as well as making sarcastic remarks on her ethnicity as she does to him. 
 Lynda Scarlino as Mrs. Abigail Milone, the elderly school monitor who is later promoted to Vice Principal of Corleone because, according to the adult Chris, she proved that the one thing that she hated a lot more than kids was working with them. She's often seen disciplining someone, and occasionally disciplines Chris even when he hasn't done anything wrong.
 Jude Ciccolella as Dr. Julius Raymond, the stern principal at Corleone Junior High. He makes racist assumptions about Chris and thinks that Chris is a crack baby. He always talks in a slow, monotone, voice. He normally is always grumpy because, according to the adult Chris, the school didn't pay him enough for his job. It is implied that he is gay when he is shown dancing with men in a bar dressed in leather. He is last seen in Everybody Hates Halloween.
 Jason Alexander as Principal Edwards, the eccentric new principal of Corleone who replaces Dr. Raymond in the second season. He is possibly the only non-racist staff member. He first appeared in Everybody Hates The Buddy System when he caught Chris and Caruso fighting and then tricks them into being buddies during a field trip. In Everybody Hates Snow Day, Chris and Edwards are the only ones who come to school on a snow day, where they develop a small-lived special relationship. In Everybody Hates Gretzky he calls to inform Julius that Chris did not show up for school. Additionally, Alexander directed two episodes for the series Everybody Hates Gambling and Everybody Hates Graduation.
 Paul Ben-Victor as Coach Roy Thurman, Chris' homeroom and social studies teacher in Tattaglia and also the coach for the football team. He hires Chris as the team's manager. He is hateful, sarcastic and unfair against people, especially towards Chris, and it is implied that he is racist or at least prejudiced, despite denying that he is, as he believes that the reason why black people were brought into slavery was because white people were too lazy to work. He once helped Chris by teaching how to box, despite the constant belittling he always gives Chris.
 Monica Anne Parales as Lisa, a hard-working, though seemingly racist Asian-American student and the head of the school's newspaper. She criticizes Chris very harshly about his writing when he joins the school's newspaper. When Chris is elected school president, she writes negative stories about him in effort to get him impeached. She is also harshly critical of Chris when he invites a white student to his school's prom.
 Peter Onorati as the Janitor and Coach Brantley. The janitor works at Tattaglia, and it is said in the show that if you give him 5 dollars, he can help you with anything. He refers to Chris as ""Hey, you're that black kid."" He has an identical cousin who is the coach of the wrestling team in Tattaglia. The coach gets Chris to join the team because no other schools have wrestlers in his weight class resulting in an automatic win.
 Johnny Palermo as Frank DiPaolo, a popular but dimwitted student. Chris picked him to be his school vice president in Corleone. He became president after Chris got impeached.
 Shelby Young, as Jennifer Thompson, a student at Corleone who at first is attracted to Chris when he joins the basketball team. In later episodes, she is seen being mean to or ignoring Chris and Greg.
 Mackenzee Donham as Jennifer, another Corleone student who is attracted to Greg. Greg is attracted to her as well but always accidentally says something that makes her angry and storm away.
 Brooke Mackenzie as Sydney, a Corleone student who is mean to Chris, constantly calling him bug-eyes.
 B. J. Britt as Walter Dickerson, the popular, selfish, careless, self-absorbed star of Tattaglia's football team who befriends Chris when he becomes the team's manager. He always belittles or insults Chris when it comes to him being nice. His catchphrase was ""My man!"" when Chris accepts one of his commands or says no, to which Walter took it too far as he began giving Chris a ridiculous amount of a chores to do for him, leaving him no time to do his own homework.
 Chris Rock as Mr. Abbott, an unhelpful school guidance counselor with a familiar voice. He tells Chris that he does not have the skills to make it to college. He advises Chris to take time to find himself instead of worrying about college. His dream was to serve America by becoming a crash test dummy.
 Marcel Lam as Bernard Yao, a Corleone student who beats Caruso up using martial arts. Bernard refuses to take Caruso's place as the school bully which causes anarchy in the school. Chris convinces Bernard to fight Caruso again and lose on purpose. Later, Bernard constantly forces Chris to do his math homework for him much to Chris's surprise who assumed Bernard was good at math because he is Asian. Highly defiant of Asian stereotypes, his catchphrase is, ""you either help me pass my math class or it's your ass"".
 Sam Mandel as Fisher, who helps forge Chris's report card. He later helps Chris retrieve Chris's father's Playboy magazine from Mrs. Milone. Though he is usually seen with friends while sitting at a desk, he has a mysterious ability to make it instantly disappear by diverting people's attention.
 Mario Quinonez Jr. as the Puerto Rican Kid in Corleone who only speaks Spanish. Was once Greg's science fair partner. He spoke English once in an episode.
 Hector A. Garcia as Angel (actually pronounced ""On-hell"" but people address him by how it's spelled), an androgynous male student at Tattaglia High, who is in Chris's cooking class. He helps Chris meet a girl in exchange for Chris helping him with his homework. Because of Angel's androgyny, he and Chris prefer not to be seen together in public. Angel appears a few times in Season 4.
 Kwame Boateng as Albert, the new black kid at Corleone who befriends Chris, which makes Greg jealous. Actually a street vandal, Albert committed several acts of vandalism inside Corleone High and Chris was framed. Greg helps Chris prove his innocence by exposing Albert's wrong deeds, resulting in Albert's expulsion.

Chris' extended family
 Earthquake as Uncle Mike, Rochelle's lazy, freeloading and obnoxious older brother. He knows how to get on Julius' bad side, such as by roaming about the house in Julius' clothes without asking him, giving him out-dated tickets for sport events or even shouting his trademark salutation ""Big man!"" at Julius – a thing that drives Julius into wrath or causes him to imagine that Mike wants something (generally unpleasant or unacceptable) from him. ""Hey 'Chelle, y'all got somethin' to eat?"" or "" I didn't know y'all was about to have dinner,"" as his repeated phrases.
 Tony Rock (real-life brother of Chris Rock) as Uncle Ryan, Julius' younger brother and Drew's favorite uncle who frequently asks him to invest in his shady business ventures. He has an office where he makes fake ID cards and X-ray glasses. His dream is to run a successful business, which can be difficult because all his attempts get shut down for one reason or another.
 Loretta Devine as Maxine, Rochelle's soft-spoken, helpful, but critical mother. She and Rochelle don't always get along because she is critical of Rochelle and likes to take over. She also caused chaos when she visited for her husband's funeral. In a later episode Rochelle tries to set her up on a date, but it didn't go so well. Maxine is also a mathematician and taught Rochelle everything she knows about math and helped out Chris with his math. It was said on one episode, that she's an even bigger ""ghetto snob"" than Rochelle.
 Monica Calhoun as Charlotte, also known as ""Grievy"", Rochelle's sensitive, sad, cynical, and unhappy younger sister who never stops crying. She's only seen at funerals.

In one episode, Rochelle claims that Charlotte cries at every holiday: Easters, Halloweens, and Flag Days.

He played for the Mobile BayBears and Las Vegas Stars before making his major league debut on August 29, 1999. In his first year, he appeared in seven games, recording a 1-3 record and a 5.97 ERA while striking out 17 batters.

In the fourth inning of that game, Carlyle threw an immaculate inning by striking out the side on nine total pitches; it was the 40th time in major-league history that the feat had been accomplished. Reflecting on Carlyle's performance, then Braves manager Bobby Cox noted that ""[Carlyle's] sneaky quick. A lot of guys don't have good hacks at him. He gets it by them.""

People from Bellevue, Nebraska
People from Sarpy County, NebraskaMeijin (名人) means ""Brilliant Man"".  It is the name of the second most prestigious Japanese Go Tournament. It also refers to a traditional Japanese title given to the strongest player of the day during the Edo period.

The tournament 
The Meijin tournament is sponsored by the Asahi newspaper, and has prize money of ¥36,000,000 for the winner and ¥10,400,000 for the runner-up.

The tournament is open to Nihon Ki-in and Kansai Ki-in players. A nine-player league decides the challenger each year. Every year, the three worst-ranked players in the league drop out. Entrance into the league is decided by three preliminaries. The first is between 1-4 dans (6 winners: 4 Nihon ki-in and 2 Kansai ki-in). The second is between 5-9 dans and the six winners (18 winners). The third is between these 18 and the 3 people dropped from the league (3 winners, who enter the league). Komi is 6.5. The time limit is 8 hours each in the title matches and 3 hours in the league and prelims. Byo-yomi is 1 minute per move.

History 
The title of ""Meijin"" derives from a game played by the first Hon'inbō, Sansa.  An onlooker (no less than Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga) watched him play a particularly brilliant move and exclaimed ""Meijin!"" in appreciation of its greatness. The term was thereafter applied to the strongest player of the day.  Sansa, besides being Nobunaga's Go tutor, also taught Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who, after taking control, established Sansa as Godokoro, roughly meaning ""Head of the Government Go Bureau."" The Meijin title came to be greatly prized by all of the most promising Go prodigies of the age, freed from the cares of everyday life by the government stipends coming from the Go Bureau.  Most often held by members of the Hon'inbō school, it was also held by brilliant Yasuis and Inoues.  No player from Hayashi house attained Meijin status.  The title ""Meijin"" is also attached to the rank of 9 dan during this period hence there is only one 9-dan/Meijin at a time even if there are many players that are at the strength of a 9 dan.  8-dans in the Edo period are called Jun-Meijin which means half-Meijin which is a rank accorded to sixteen players in the Edo period.  After the Meiji Revolution, the four houses fell into disrepair due to the lack of government stipends.

In 1958, the Yomiuri newspaper decided to sponsor a ""Strongest Player"" tournament to decide the strongest player of the current time.  In 1961 the tournament's name was changed to Meijin.

Since they already sponsored the Shogi Meijin tournament, in 1975 the Asahi newspaper offered to buy the rights to the Meijin tournament from the Yomiuri. After months of debating, the title was sold and the Yomiuri began sponsoring a new title, Kisei (Go Saint). The tournament before 1976 thus became called the Old Meijin.

This was released under Nems Enterprises in Argentina, and Rock Brigade Records in Brazil. This Nepal album has the collaboration of many notorious musicians such as Ricardo Iorio, André Matos, George Biddle, Kiko Loureiro, Martin Walkyier and Hansi Kursch.

Manifiesto was recorded with Holophonics 3D Sound system, made and developed by the engineer Hugo Zuccarelli. With this technology, the audience can experience the sound three-dimensionally: listening to the album gives the impression of hearing the vocals and the instruments from outside, like in reality. This technology has been utilized by bands and musicians like Pink Floyd, YES, Roger Waters, Vangelis, Steve Vai and Paul McCartney.

The concerts for the release of their new album started in January 1998. In April, the band played as support for the band Moonspell. On 22 August, they did so for Blind Guardian in Buenos Aires at ""Cemento"". The same year they participated in the ""Metal Rock Festival II"".

Mouse lemursWerner Hans Frederik Abrahamson Læssøe was a Danish officer known for his service in the First Schleswig War. He was the son of Margrethe Juliane Signe Læssøe and the brother of the priest Kristian Frederik Læssøe, the painter Thorald Læssøe and the numismatist Ludvig Læssøe.

Biography
Læssøe became a lieutenant in an infantry regiment in 1830, was a student at the War College in 1832-1836 and was then employed in the general staff, where he was promoted to captain in 1842. For several years he was engaged in measurement and mapping work, which in recent times benefited Hedeselskabet's water supply plans, and served 1844-1845 as a teacher at the war academy, but was removed from this place, because his excessive independent ideas made him less popular with foremen, especially as he was politically leaning towards the National Liberal Party.

At the outbreak of First Schleswig War, Læssøe was chief of staff at the army command. He participated in the battles at Bov, Nybøl and Dybbøl Banke. On this occasion, Læssøe came into conflict with the Minister of War, who questioned the competence of the army's leadership. And as a result of the Defeat at Egernførde, the hunt for a scapegoat began. Minister of War Hansen then used the defeat to remove the commander of the high command, General Christoph von Krogh and his chief of staff Frederik Læssøe.

But when General Olaf Rye was given the task of leading the withdrawal of the Danish army in 1849, he got Læssøe with him in his staff, and he participated in the Battle of Kolding . Læssøe was appointed colonel in 1850 and led the 12th battalion in the Battle of Isted, where he fell during the fighting. He was buried in Flensburg.

Læssøesgade in both Aarhus, Copenhagen and Læssøegade in Kolding is named after him.

It derives its name (which means 'Saxon woods' in English) from being located in the former Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, earlier also called Lower Saxony, now mostly covered by the Herzogtum Lauenburg (Duchy of Lauenburg) district. The Sachsenwald has an area of 68 km2. It was given to Otto von Bismarck in 1871 for his achievements for Germany. Today the managed forest area amounts to about 6,000 hectares, of which 4,500 still belong to the House of Bismarck, residing at Friedrichsruh. From 1989, Ferdinand von Bismarck sold 2,250 hectares to the shipowner Eberhart von Rantzau, owner of the Deutsche Afrika-Linien.

Surnames of Norman originSzymon Goldberg (1 June 190919 July 1993) was a Polish-born Jewish classical violinist and conductor, latterly an American.

Born in Włocławek, Congress Poland, Goldberg played the violin as a child growing up in Warsaw. His first teacher was Henryk Czaplinski, a pupil of the great Czech violinist Otakar Ševčík; his second was Mieczysław Michałowicz, a pupil of Leopold Auer. In 1917, at age eight, Goldberg moved to Berlin to study the violin with the legendary pedagogue Carl Flesch. He was also a student of Josef Wolfsthal.

After a recital in Warsaw in 1921, and a debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1924 in which he played three concertos, he was engaged as concert-master of the Dresden Philharmonic from 1925 to 1929. In 1929 he was offered the position of concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic by its principal conductor, Wilhelm Furtwängler. He accepted the position, serving from 1930 to 1934. During these years, he also performed in a string trio with Paul Hindemith on viola and Emanuel Feuermann on cello, and also led a string quartet of Berlin Philharmonic members.

The rise of the Third Reich forced Goldberg to leave the orchestra in 1934, despite Furtwängler's attempts to safeguard the Jewish members of the orchestra. Thereafter, he toured Europe with the pianist Lili Kraus. He made his American debut in New York in 1938 at Carnegie Hall. While in the former Netherlands East Indies he formed the Goldberg Quartet, together with Robert Pikler on viola, Louis Mojzer on cello and Eugenie Emerson, piano. Pikler and MOJZER were Hungarians and Emerson was American. This Piano Quartet toured the major cities in Java, before the Japanese invasion and occupation. Goldberg's first wife was a skilled artist and sculptor. She was interned in the Tjihapit Women's Camp in Bandung, together with Mojzer's Family. While Goldberg and Kraus were on a tour of Asia, they and their families were interned in Java by the Japanese from 1942 to 1945.

He toured Australia for three months in 1946.  Eventually he went to the United States and became a naturalised American citizen in 1953. From 1951 to 1965 he taught at the Aspen Music School. Concurrently he was active as a conductor. In 1955 he founded the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra in Amsterdam, which he led until 1979. He also took the ensemble on many tours. From the years 1977 to 1979 he was the conductor of the Manchester Camerata.

He taught at Yale University from 1978 to 1982, the Juilliard School in New York City from 1978 to 1989 the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia from 1980 to 1981, and the Manhattan School of Music in New York starting in 1981. From 1990 until his death, he conducted the New Japan Philharmonic in Tokyo.

His first wife died in the 1980s after a long illness. In 1988, he married his second wife, Japanese pianist Miyoko Yamane (1938–2006), a former student of Rudolf Serkin and Rudolf Kolisch; they resided primarily in Philadelphia (with annual visits to Japan) until 1992, when they moved to Toyama, Japan. He died in Toyama in 1993, aged 84.

He made a number of recordings, most notably a celebrated series of Mozart and Beethoven sonatas with Lili Kraus before World War II, the three Brahms Sonatas with Artur Balsam (Brunswick AXTL 1082), and Mozart and Schubert pieces with Radu Lupu (with whom he performed as a duo in concert) in the 1970s. 
 The Berlin Philharmonic, in a 2014 tribute to their former concertmaster, wrote that in the music of Bach and Mozart, Goldberg ""brought a poise and a beauty of tone that seemed like perfection. Indeed he was the finest Mozart violinist of his time, with the feline grace essential for the violin sonatas, the concertos and the Sinfonia concertante.""

He owned and played the ""Baron Vitta"" Giuseppe Guarneri (Guarneri del Gesù) violin; after his death his widow gave it to the Library of Congress.

59,238,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type4,"Mount Shuksan is a glaciated massif in the North Cascades National Park. Shuksan rises in Whatcom County, Washington immediately to the east of Mount Baker, and  south of the Canada–US border. The mountain's name Shuksan is derived from the Lummi word [šéqsən], said to mean ""high peak"". The highest point on the mountain is a three-sided peak known as Summit Pyramid.

The mountain is composed of Shuksan greenschist, oceanic basalt that was metamorphosed when the Easton terrane collided with the west coast of North America, approximately 120 million years ago. The mountain is an eroded remnant of a thrust plate formed by the Easton collision.

The Mount Baker Highway, State Route 542, is kept open during the winter to support Mt. Baker Ski Area. In late summer, the road to Artist Point allows visitors to travel a few miles higher for a closer view of the peak. Picture Lake is accessible on the highway and reflects the mountain, making it a popular site for photography.

Sulphide Creek Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in North America, plunges off the southeastern flank of Mount Shuksan. There are four other tall waterfalls that spill off Mount Shuksan and neighboring Jagged Ridge and Seahpo Peak, mostly sourced from small snowfields and glaciers.

The traditional name of Mount Shuksan in the Nooksack language is Shéqsan (""high foot"") or Ch’ésqen (""golden eagle""). Both the Nooksack and Lummi are indigenous tribes who have occupied the watersheds of the Nooksack Rivers and Lummi River, respectively. They are both [[federally recognized tribes in the United States.

The first ascent of Mount Shuksan is usually attributed to Asahel Curtis and W. Montelius Price on September 7, 1906. However, in a 1907 letter to the editor of the Mazamas club journal, C. E. Rusk attributed the first ascent to Joseph Morowits in 1897. He said that he himself would have attempted it in 1903 if he had not been sure that it had already been climbed.

57,239,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type3,"Rear Admiral Craig Eugene Steidle, USN, Ret., (born July 12, 1945) served as the first Associate Administrator of the Office of Exploration Systems at NASA (now known as the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate), an organization formed to implement NASA's human exploration of the solar system as announced in the Vision for Space Exploration.  Admiral Steidle also served as Program Manager of the Joint Strike Fighter Program.  He is currently serving as a Distinguished Visiting Professor in Aerospace Engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy.

During his tenure with the United States Navy, Admiral Steidle became most well known for his prominent role as Program Manager of the Joint Strike Fighter where he managed the ""fly off"" between the X-32 and the X-35 to determine what design would ultimately become the F-35 Lightning II.  Admiral Steidle also commanded the Navy’s F/A-18 program, the naval aviation’s largest production research and development program, as well as the largest foreign military sales program.

Navy career

Admiral Steidle joined the Navy after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1968. In the Navy, he trained to become an attack pilot and flew carrier night combat missions over North Vietnam. In the 1980s he deployed on carriers, frigates, and cruisers in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean.  Steidle went on to command the Navy’s F/A-18 program, and then became the Director of the DOD Joint Advanced Strike Technology Office.   The admiral opted to retire from the Navy in March 2000.

Post-Navy Career

After retiring from the Navy, Craig Steidle worked as a self-employed aerospace consultant.  In January 2004, Adm. Steidle accepted a position as associate administrator of the Office of Exploration Systems at NASA.  The purpose of the Office of Exploration Systems was to design, develop, and produce the new architecture and vehicles to send the United States beyond Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo moon missions of the 1960s.  The Centennial Challenges prize program was also implemented by the Office of Exploration Systems during this time.   The office was renamed the Exploration Systems Directorate in an August 2004 restructuring.  Admiral Steidle officially resigned from the position of associate administrator for exploration systems in June 2005.  He served as a Visiting Professor in Aerospace Engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy for five years and then briefly as the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation before fully retiring in 2011.

Education

Craig Steidle grew up in Huntington, Long Island, N.Y. and attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland where he graduated with merit in 1968.  Later, Steidle went to the University of Southern California and earned a Master of Science degree in systems management.  He also attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University where he earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering. Admiral Steidle was a Distinguished Graduate from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in June 1976.

Personal

Admiral Steidle resides in Southern Maine. His daughter, Gretchen Steidle Wallace is the President and Founder of Global Grassroots (www.globalgrassroots.org), a nonprofit which assists marginalized women in Rwanda and Uganda and helps them start social entrepreneurships to better their communities.  His oldest son, Brian Steidle, former Captain in the US Marine Corps,  served as a peace monitor in Darfur during the Darfur Conflict and wrote a book with his sister about his experiences, The Devil Came on Horseback, which was turned into a documentary film of the same name that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. Steidle's youngest son, Eric Steidle, USNA '04, is a Commander in the US Naval Reserves.

28,242,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type5,"The PilZ protein family is named after the type IV pilus control protein first identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, expressed as part of the pil operon. It has a cytoplasmic location and is essential for type IV fimbrial, or pilus, biogenesis. PilZ is a c-di-GMP binding domain and PilZ domain-containing proteins represent the best studied class of c-di-GMP effectors.  C-di-GMP, cyclic diguanosine monophosphate, the second messenger in cells, is widespread in and unique to the bacterial kingdom. Elevated intracellular levels of c-di-GMP generally cause bacteria to change from a motile single-cell state to a sessile, adhesive surface-attached multicellular state called biofilm.

Proteins which contain PilZ are known to interact with the flagellar switch-complex proteins FliG and FliM and this is mediated via the c-di-GMP-PliZ complex. This interaction results in a reduction of torque-generation and induces counterclockwise motor bias that slows the motor and induces counterclockwise rotation, inhibiting chemotaxis.

Binding and mutagenesis studies of several PilZ domain proteins have shown that c-di-GMP binding depends on residues in RxxxR and D/NxSxxG sequence-motifs. The crystal structure, at 1.7 A, of a PilZ domain::c-di-GMP complex from Vibrio cholerae shows c-di-GMP contacting seven of nine strongly conserved residues. Binding of c-di-GMP causes a conformational switch whereby the C- and N-terminal domains are brought into close opposition forming a new allosteric interaction surface that spans these domains and the c-di-GMP at their interface.

The PilZ domain is also implicated in the bacterial pathogenicity of the Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, through its binding partner c-di-GMP.

AlibunarThe culo'e puya drums, also known as culoepuya, culo e puya, or culepuya, are a battery of small drums originally from Venezuela, with a Kongo lineage. They are used in an ensemble also known as redondo drums, after the dance motion and the circle which forms around the dancers during performance.

Organology

The culo'e puya battery comprises three drums made of lightweight wood from the tree known locally as lano or ceiba de lana (Ceiba pentandra, a member of the Bombacaceae family, to which Balsa also belongs). Both ends have skin heads, which are joined with tensors made of rope (nylon rope is commonly used today). The drums are roughly 1.5 m (4 ft.) in length and between 10 and 15 cm (4-6 inches) in diameter.

The inside of the drum is carved in the shape of an hourglass, instead of a cylinder.

There are three different diameters, each corresponding to a distinct ""voice"" or pattern. The different diameters are known as:

Prima - The smallest. Also called hembra (female) or quitimba or quichimba (a word of probable African origin, but whose exact meaning has been lost).
Cruzao - The middle diameter drum. The name means ""hybrid"" or ""crossed"".
Pujao - The largest diameter. Also called macho (male). The word pujao is a vernacular misspelling of the past participle of the verb pujar, which means to struggle, to push, or (colloquially, in South America) to moan as a result of extreme effort.

Playing technique
Redondo drums are held between the player's legs and played with a stick in one hand and the fingers of the other (bare) hand. There are six basic strokes:

Open stroke with bare hand.
Closed stroke with bare hand's fingertips.
Bass stroke with the heel of the bare hand.
Open stroke with stick on drum head.
Closed stroke with stick on drum head.
Side stick.

Rhythms

Culo'e Puya drums are typical of the Barlovento region of North-central Venezuela. They are most commonly used in the festivities of the Summer Solstice/St. John the Baptist (June 24) as part of the Redondo ensemble, which also includes one or two maracas, voice and hand claps. The redondo players accompany the processions dedicated to St. John and play alongside it in an ensemble often called tambor pequeño or (small drum), to distinguish it from another battery of drums used during the St. John festivities, known as tambor grande (large drum), or Mina.

The basic pattern is usually notated in  or  time signatures. Each town in Barlovento has a unique way of interpreting the basic pattern and adds its own local variation, but in general, the prima carries the base of the rhythm and it is played on the upbeats, while the pujao improvises and the cruzao marks the downbeats. This contrasts with the role of the conga drums in the Cuban rumba, where the smallest drum is the soloist.

The pujao improvisations are centered on a set pattern, but they can achieve an impressive degree of variety when the percussionist is able to tune the drum while performing. This maneuver is considerably difficult, and it is based on the bass stroke to tune the drum down and a series of side hits to the edge of the drum head with the heel of the bare hand to tune the drum back up.

The Barlovento towns of Curiepe, Tacarigüita, La Boca and Mendoza still maintain the tradition of the Culo'e Puya, but their sound and unique rhythm has influenced the rest of the native forms of Venezuelan music.

Commercial recordings featuring the culo'e puya
The American jazz composer Henry Threadgill featured two culo'e puya players on his 1993 album Too Much Sugar for a Dime.
Cuban pianist Omar Sosa included the sound of culo'e puyas in his release entitled Sentir.

His brother, Gene Fenn, became a fashion photographer and painter. Fenn attended the New York School of Design (now called the New York School of Interior Design) from 1931 to 1935 where he studied painting, scenic design and window-display. After graduating, Fenn began working for French-American sculptor Pierre Bourdelle, assisting him on his bas-relief sculptures and murals for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition, the 1939 New York World's Fair, and for the transatlantic ocean liner S.S. America(1940). Fenn designed stage sets for summer stock theater in Tamworth, New Hampshire where he was art director for The Barnstormers Theater between 1938 and 1940.

Photography career
Fenn transitioned into photography work in 1941 when Louise Dahl-Wolfe, a fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar, hired him as an assistant. In spring 1946, they traveled to Paris, France, to photograph the first post-World War II fashion collections. Fenn remained in Paris for six months to work as a staff photographer for Harper's Bazaar Paris.

In 1948, Fenn opened his own photography studio in the Graybar Building at 420 Lexington Avenue and in 1952 moved to 132 East 58th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Fenn photographed fashion for Town & Country magazine and Bergdorf Goodman, and captured portraits of personalities including Jean Cocteau, Gore Vidal, Mae West, William Saroyan, and Tallulah Bankhead. In 1950, Harry Rodman, director of advertising for Lord & Taylor department store, hired Fenn for their commercial fashion photography account. He continued to work for Lord & Taylor throughout his career as well as for clients Daniel and Charles Advertising Agency, Amelia Earhart Luggage, CBS and NBC television and radio. Fenn's photographs were published in Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Theatre Arts, The New Yorker, The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune.

In 1961, Fenn formed a partnership with still life painter Mary Faulconer to produce editorial photographs of food, home interiors, and architectural design. Faulconer/Fenn photographs appeared in House Beautiful, House & Garden, Woman's Day, Look, Better Homes and Gardens, Ladies Home Journal, and This Week Magazine.

Work with Andy Warhol
Andy Warhol, then a young commercial artist, met Otto Fenn in 1951 and began stopping by Fenn's studio frequently. Throughout the 1950s they collaborated on a number of creative projects. Warhol posed for Fenn portraits. Fenn experimented with projections of Warhol drawings of flowers and butterflies onto the faces of models. Warhol drew backdrops for Fenn's fashion sittings, created drawings of Fenn from Fenn's self-portraits, and created a series of drawings of men in drag based on photographs taken by Fenn.According to Whitney Museum of American Art curator, Donna De Salvo, Fenn's studio was a prototype for The Factory, Warhol's studio of the 1960s.

Historic preservation work
In 1961, Fenn purchased and restored the historic David Hand House, dated to the 1600s, in the Village of Sag Harbor on Long Island, New York. In 1972, he was appointed as a technical advisor to the Sag Harbor Historic Preservation Commission. The Sag Harbor Village District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 1973.

Later life
Otto Fenn moved permanently to Sag Harbor in 1975. He died on February 5, 1993 in Sag Harbor, New York.

15,247,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type0,"Nicholas C. Wasicsko (; May 13, 1959 – October 29, 1993) was an American politician from New York and the youngest-ever mayor of Yonkers, New York. As mayor he fought for the desegregation of public housing.

Early life and education
Wasicsko was born May 13, 1959, in Yonkers, to Nicholas and Anne Slota Wasicsko. He was of Slovak descent. Wasicsko attended public schools in Yonkers. He graduated from Gorton High School in Yonkers in 1977.

Wasicsko graduated from Manhattan College in 1981 with a degree in government and served for a year as a county police officer. His father died in 1985. In 1986 and 1987 he served as 7th Ward councilman while simultaneously attending New York Law School, from which he was graduated in 1987, the same year he was elected mayor. He was admitted to the bar in New York and Connecticut.

Career
On Nov. 3, 1987, at the age of 28, Wasicsko defeated six-term Republican-Conservative incumbent Angelo R. Martinelli, age 60, to become the youngest-ever mayor of Yonkers, and the youngest mayor in a major American city. Wasicsko won by a margin of 1,466 votes of the 42,700 cast.

The major issue in the 1987 election was the court-ordered integration of public housing in Yonkers. As a candidate, Wasicsko advocated ""for resisting the court-ordered integration by legal appeals."" Martinelli and Wasicsko ""had not taken dramatically opposite positions on the integration dispute, but ... Mayor Martinelli had become identified with much of the emotion surrounding the issue,"" contributing to his loss.

Wasicsko waged an aggressive battle to set in motion a housing desegregation plan for the city. Although he received numerous accolades for his position, including a runner-up citation for the 1991 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, opposition was equally strong, and he received death threats.

The city council initially signed a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Yonkers NAACP on a housing plan, but in August 1988, on a procedural vote, the city council voted 4 to 3 to rescind its support for the binding consent decree. A federal court proposed fines to the city of Yonkers that would have risen within weeks to $1 million per day, and fines for the individual Yonkers city council members who opposed the integration plan of $500 per day, and would have jailed them within a month. On September 9, 1988, with the fines mounting, city services being curtailed, and 630 city employees about to be laid off, the city council relented, and the housing integration plan was approved.

As a result of the controversy, Wasicsko lost a bid for re-election as mayor in 1989.  Once out of office, Wasicsko practiced law, taught at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and hosted a local radio talk show. He returned to elected office in 1992 as 2nd District councilman. He was named Democratic minority leader.

In 1993 he made an unsuccessful primary run for City Council President.

Death
Wasicsko was found dead of an apparent suicide at 5:20 p.m. on Friday, October 29, 1993, at the age of 34. He was found sitting against a tree on a grassy hill overlooking the grave of his father at Oakland Cemetery in Yonkers, New York, with a single gunshot wound in his head. He owned a licensed 38-caliber pistol, and the gun was found in his right hand. There was speculation at the time that Wasicsko feared an ongoing corruption investigation of the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, of which Wasicsko was a board member and former chairman, would tarnish his reputation but investigators said they had no reason to believe Wasicsko was corrupt.

Personal life
Wasicsko married Nay Noe, a former secretary, on May 18, 1991, at St. Casimir's Church in Yonkers. He lived with his wife and mother in a gabled green Victorian house in Yonkers.

Media
In 1999, former New York Times writer Lisa Belkin wrote the book Show Me a Hero about Wasicsko and the desegregation case. A six-episode HBO television miniseries of the same name, based on the book, written by David Simon and journalist William F. Zorzi and directed by Paul Haggis, premiered on August 16, 2015. Oscar Isaac played Wasicsko and later won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film for his performance.

Brick by Brick: A Civil Rights Story, a 2007 documentary film about the Yonkers desegregation struggle, featured Wasicsko prominently as a lonely proponent of compliance with federal court orders to build low income and affordable housing in 1988.

20th-century American politiciansMarv is a fictional character in the graphic novel series Sin City, created by Frank Miller. In the 2005 film adaptation and its 2014 sequel, he is played by Mickey Rourke. He first appears in The Hard Goodbye and follows with appearances in A Dame to Kill For, Just Another Saturday Night, and Silent Night.  He makes a brief cameo in Blue Eyes (as featured in Lost, Lonely, and Lethal).

Marv has been well received both as a comic book character and a film character.

Appearances in the Sin City series
Marv is one of the major characters of the series, and appears or is mentioned in nearly every book. He is the protagonist of the first Sin City ""yarn"", The Hard Goodbye, as well as two shorter installments, Silent Night and Just Another Saturday Night. He also has a supporting role in A Dame to Kill For.

The Hard Goodbye
The Hard Goodbye begins as Marv has sex with a beautiful blonde prostitute named Goldie, only to wake up to find her dead and himself framed for her murder. He escapes from the cops and vows that he will avenge Goldie's death, killing his way through a chain of small-time thugs before learning the identity of Goldie's killer to be a mute and cannibalistic serial killer named Kevin. Kevin is the ward of Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark, and is thus under the protection of the powerful Roark family.

Marv finds Kevin, but is knocked out and finds himself in Kevin's basement, which is decorated with the heads of prostitutes mounted on the mantle. Marv also discovers that his parole officer, Lucille, is Kevin's next intended victim; he has already eaten her hand. He escapes with Lucille, who is killed by a squad of Sin City police. Marv, hearing from Lucille that Goldie was a prostitute, heads off to Old Town for more information before being ambushed by Goldie's twin sister Wendy, who also believed that Marv killed her sister. Marv convinces Wendy of his innocence and reluctantly takes her along to the infamous Roark family farm to subdue Kevin. Knocking Wendy out so she would not witness what will occur next, Marv inflicts the most brutal form of death he can imagine: sawing off Kevin's legs and leaving him to be eaten by his own pet wolf. Marv then finds Cardinal Roark, who admits that he and Kevin had been killing and cannibalizing prostitutes together and that Kevin killed Goldie for knowing too much. Marv kills Roark in an unspecified (but presumably grisly) manner before the police burst in and shower Marv with bullets.

Marv survives, however, creating a problem for the Roark family and the corrupt police force as he possesses knowledge that would have the city implode. The police threaten to kill Marv's mother unless he confesses to the murders that Roark and Kevin committed; Marv agrees, but only after breaking an attorney's arm in three places. He has a steak and a beer for his last meal. He is sentenced to die in the electric chair. Before his execution, Wendy visits him one last time to thank him for everything he has done. Marv goes to the chair, but survives the first jolt, defiantly saying to his executioners: ""Is that the best you can do, you pansies?"" They have to pull the switch again to finish him off, announcing ""He's gone"".

A Dame to Kill For
In A Dame To Kill For (which is set just before The Hard Goodbye) Marv becomes a sidekick of sorts to his good friend Dwight McCarthy, agreeing to help him rescue his former lover Ava Lord. When it is revealed to be a set-up, he rushes a mortally wounded Dwight to Old Town, where he is taken in by his former 'associate' Gail. Shortly afterwards, Marv becomes involved with Goldie.

Silent Night
In Silent Night, Marv rescues a young girl from sexual torture. The story is told with almost no dialogue.

Just Another Saturday Night
In Just Another Saturday Night, Marv wakes up on the side of a highway, surrounded by dead men, and tries to piece together how he got there.

Physical appearance
Marv is depicted as an extremely imposing,  man with a flattop buzzcut, a falcon-like nose and a heavily scarred face, making him unappealing to the opposite sex. He has a massive frame and is distinctly broad-shouldered, generally towering over his fellow characters. He is usually seen dressed in an overcoat, white undershirt, leather pants and combat boots.

Personality
In the book Sin City: The Making of the Movie, creator Frank Miller describes the creation of Marv as a juxtaposition of his two biggest influences: film noir and medieval stories. The result was the idea for a character he called ""Conan in a trench coat.""

In the film Sin City his good friend Dwight remarks ""most people think Marv is crazy. He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century. He'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield swinging an axe into somebody's face. Or in a Roman arena, taking his sword to other gladiators like him.""

Even for someone his size, Marv has an unusual level of speed which, coupled with his well developed fighting skills, incredible strength and pain tolerance, allow him to bring down nearly anyone who challenges him or breaks his personal code of ethics with startling ease. He notes with a measure of grudging respect in The Hard Goodbye that Kevin is the only person to ever successfully sneak up on him. Marv is also fond of long trench coats, and immediately prior to killing someone in possession of such a coat, he often remarks something to the effect of ""That's a damn fine coat you're wearing"", after which he takes their coat, especially if the one he had was damaged.

He suffers from an unnamed mental condition that causes him to ""get confused"", which, judging from his own awareness of his illness and the effects it is shown to have, probably involves short-term memory loss and possibly hallucinations. He also fears ""turn[ing] into what they always said [he] was gonna turn into- a maniac, a psycho killer."" Lucille, his parole officer, supplies him with medication (presumably antipsychotics) through her girlfriend Claire to control these effects of his condition. Claire, a psychiatrist, once tried to analyze him, but he claims she got ""too scared.""

Marv has convinced himself that he doesn't have a particularly high intellect, but he shows a surprising amount of intelligence when needed, noticeably an ability to logically deduce confusing and complex events quite accurately, sometimes based on scarce or conflicting information, and his skills in combat also imply a degree of intelligence from a tactical viewpoint. However, in most situations he just smashes his way through conflicts, such as kicking down a door and sending police flying, or charging a squad of heavily armed cops whilst only armed with a hatchet. In at least one instance, after being tied to a chair by Gail, who states that knots are her specialty, she and the rest of the girls of Old Town are startled to find out Marv was able to untie himself while being beaten by her, all without anyone in the room even noticing.

Marv has a well-developed skill and a strong appetite for torture. He never blinks, nor seems to think twice about inflicting the slowest, most creatively painful death he can possibly implement on his worst enemies. He often speaks in a soft, plain-spoken, calm, almost nonchalant demeanor, showing no sign of hesitation or fear, even while committing gruesome killings. Marv shows little to no fear in dangerous situations, even when heavily outnumbered, and faces them with a dry laconic humor. In The Hard Goodbye, instead of panicking when cornered by several members of the SWAT team, upon being asked to open the door, he lights up a cigarette and very calmly states ""I'll be right out."", before successfully fighting his way out of the building.

While Marv has no compunction about maiming and killing anyone he feels has wronged him or those close to him, even he has his limits. He is deeply afraid of winding up as ""a maniac [or] a psycho killer"" (as mentioned previously). Marv will only kill someone if, as he himself puts it, ""I know for sure I ought to."" He makes it a point to avoid unnecessarily hurting or killing those who have not earned it in his eyes, and also notes with some amusement that he enjoys confrontations with paid hitmen, since he never feels guilty about what he does to them. A perfect example of his resolve to avoid causing unnecessary harm is when he knocks out Wendy rather than let her watch him dismember Kevin; he believed Wendy witnessing Kevin's dismemberment would cause her a lifetime of nightmares, and would therefore be unnecessarily hurting her, a belief which also superseded his otherwise ironclad rule against hitting women. He also adheres unrelentingly to his own personal code of honor, which dictates the repayment of debts and chivalry towards women, stating that ""it really gets my goat when guys rough up dames"", even refusing to lay a finger on Gail, who wrongly believed he had killed several prostitutes under her employ, after she tied him to a chair and tortured him for information. He also highly values kindness, often going out of his way to repay kindness shown to him. As such, he will defend anyone whom he considers a friend or has shown him kindness until he is no longer capable, or he feels the debt has been repaid, whichever comes first. As a devout Catholic, Marv condones the violence and blood on his hands, both figurative and literal, as justice against those who would do evil in the world, even if Marv's personal brand of justice might fly in the face of Catholic teachings. It may be best paraphrased as ""It may be God's job to judge a man's evil deeds, but it Marv's job to arrange the meeting."" noting that some things in this world are, in Marv's own words, ""worth going to Hell for"".

Marv is shown to have a platonic relationship with Nancy, being a sort of guardian angel to her, especially after an incident in which ""some frat boyfriend of hers roughed her up"". Another platonic relationship is with his social worker, Lucille, who is a lesbian. While Marv has no objections to her being a homosexual, or to homosexuality in general, he simply cannot fathom why Lucille is a lesbian, stating ""that with a body like hers, she can have any man she wanted."" Marv also has a soft spot for children, suggested when he rescues a little girl from pimps in Silent Night, as well as for animals, as shown when he knocks out, rather than kills, Kevin's wolf, which he only does as a matter of necessity to maintain the element of surprise, since Kevin's wolf had otherwise done nothing to wrong him.  Throughout the story, Marv often shows a good-natured, humorous side, unresentful of even the worst that fate can throw at him and often showing a wry laconic sense of humor at the absurdity of his situations.

The one woman Marv loves above all others is his mother. His mother, who is blind, has a nigh-supernatural sense of hearing, and can hear Marv tip-toeing around the house, even when he is completely silent.  She dotes on her only son, keeping his room exactly as he left it when he moved out, and shows concern for him when people come looking for him.  He, in turn, treats her with great respect and is very protective of her, doing his best to keep her from harm or anyone who would even threaten to hurt her. For instance, when an assistant DA threatens her life after he refuses to sign a false confession, Marv signs it (after fracturing the assistant DA's arm in three places)

Movie appearance
Marv is played by Mickey Rourke in the first film adaptation; Rourke took to the role despite the heavy amount of make-up work required and the minimal use of sets and even other actors. Because of the speed at which the film was shot (and the fact that most of the cast who appeared in multiple stories hadn't yet been cast), several of the people Rourke is seen interacting with weren't necessarily there during the day it was shot. During the scenes at Kadie's, he never met or interacted with Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen or Jessica Alba, all of whom were yet to be cast or scheduled for filming; those scenes were all shot on different days several months later. Similarly, Rutger Hauer and Elijah Wood never met Rourke either. Hauer was one of the last people to be cast and his scene was shot months after The Hard Goodbye had finished principal photography. Wood and Rourke were shot fighting each other's respective stunt doubles.

He also makes a cameo appearance in the segment That Yellow Bastard at the same bar where John Hartigan goes to look for Nancy Callahan, just as featured in The Hard Goodbye.

Rourke reprises his role as Marv in the 2014 sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.

Rourke's portrayal of the character was very popular among audiences and critics, winning awards from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, Online Film Critics Society, Chicago Film Critics Association, and the Irish Film and Television Awards.  On the Sin City DVD, Frank Miller commented that ""After [the interview] with Rourke, I was only able to get down one note: 'He IS Marv!'""

Merchandising

In 1999, Marv's likeness was captured in the form of three McFarlane Toys action figures, all depicting scenes from ""The Hard Goodbye.""  One comes with Kevin's severed head and a gun, while another figure was made with bandages on his face. The latter also comes in black and white and a gun, while the other, known as ""Death Row Marv"", comes with an electric chair.

Death Row Marv was comparably rare to most other action figures on the market, as it was offered exclusively to comic book specialty stores and was not made available to larger chains such as Toys R Us and Walmart.  Despite the fact that this was a collectible marketed solely towards adults, it caused a considerable amount of controversy.

In 2005, the license for Sin City toys has been acquired by NECA, who has also done their own versions of ""Death Row Marv"".

In 2007, Marv was announced to be in the second series of Marvel Toys' Legendary comic book heroes action figure line. Shortly afterward, another company, Dynamic Forces announced a full series of Sin City comic figures, which will start with a repaint of the Marvel Toys Marv figure.

In popular culture
In 2006, French country troubadour Steffan Rock recorded a song called ""The Return of Marv"", which is a tribute to both the character and Mickey Rourke.

Marv and the film adaptation of Sin City was parodied in the Robot Chicken episode ""Bionic Cow"". Marv is portrayed as a gruff, mean-spirited protector of cats and grandmas in ""Virtue City"". He was voiced by Hugh Davidson.

Reception
Marv has been well received both as a comic book character and a film character. Marv was ranked as the 24th greatest comic book character in Wizard magazine. Empire magazine also ranked Marv as the 26th greatest comic book character of all time writing that ""Marv is a grade A patsy, the fall guy, the hapless hero at the center of a conspiracy that he can't even begin to understand but with a traditional Miller tweak... [he is] a force of nature, cutting a path through the corrupt power-brokers of the city, until his pound of flesh (and more) has been exacted."" Also in 2008, Empire Magazine ranked Marv as the 82nd greatest film characters: ""He ain't too bright, but it turns out that Marv, despite his seemingly indestructible (if bandage-swathed) exterior, has a soft center."" IGN also listed Marv as the 75th greatest comic book hero of all time, writing that ""Sin City is a place where only the strong and sadistic can survive. Marv is a little of both, but he also has a noble streak and an unbreakable sense of loyalty towards those few people who can see beneath his craggy exterior and recognize the good man within.""

24,248,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type8,"The Central Zoo is a  zoo in Jawalakhel, Nepal. It is home to some 870 animals in 109 species, and is operated by the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC). Although it was originally a private zoo, it was opened to the public in 1956.

During the Bhoto Jatra festival, celebrated near the zoo, the zoo may see upwards of 34,000 visitors in a single day after they come to see a historical jeweled vest at the culmination of the Rato Machchhindranath jatra.

History

The Central Zoo was established in 1932 by Rana Prime Minister Juddha Shumser as a private zoo, and came under government control in 1950. It was opened to the public in 1956, and in December 1995, the government handed over responsibility of the zoo to the National Trust for Nature Conservation. Although work is not complete, the NTNC has been upgrading the facilities so that animals can live in larger enclosures that simulate their natural environment. It is also working towards turning the zoo into a research and educational facility, as well as remaining a tourist attraction.

The central pond at the zoo was built during the rule of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, and at one time was the source of water for Patan.

Animals

The zoo is home to about 870 animals in 109 species, including 15 of 38 endangered local species including Royal Bengal tigers and one-horned rhinoceros, as well as many animals from around the world including hippos, siamang, ostriches, chimpanzee, lemur, and many birds.

Administrative parts

The town part of Butovice and the village of Nová Horka are administrative parts of Studénka.

Geography
Studénka is situated on both sides of the historical border between Moravia and Silesia; Butovice and Nová Horka lies in Moravia and the town proper in Silesia. Studénka is located about  northeast of Nový Jičín and  southwest of Ostrava.

Studénka lies in the Moravian Gate on the left bank of the Oder River. Two sets of fish ponds are located in the municipal territory.

History
The first written mention of Studénka is from 1436. The village of Butovice was first mentioned in 1324 and Nová Horka in 1374. For centuries, Studénka was an agricultural village, and its population was Czech; Butovice was focused on cattle breeding and pond farming and had a predominantly German population.

In 1467–1569, Studénka was owned by the lords of Fulštejn, then it was owned by the Pražma of Bílkov family, who joined it to the Bílovec estate. After the Bohemian Revolt, the properties of the family were confiscated, and in 1634 the village was acquired by Václav of Vrbno, who joined it to the Fulnek estate. In the 18th century, Studénka was bought by the Mönnich family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by the Wahlstatt family.

In 1881 and 1890, the railway lines Studénka–Štramberk and Studénka–Bílovec were opened, and in 1900, a factory for the production of railway cars was established. The factory became the main employer in the region and contributed to the development of the village.

In 1959, until then an independent municipality Butovice was merged with Studénka and Studénka obtained the statute of a town.

Demography

Economy
The traditional production of railway cars ended in 2006 and the Vagónka Studénka company was restructuralized. Since 2006, the factory has been a manufacturer of metal products known as MSV Metal Studénka.

Transport
Studénka lies on the international railway line between Kraków and Prague, and was the scene of the 2008 Studénka train wreck and the 2015 Studénka train crash.

Sport
SK Studénka is a Czech handball club which plays in the top tier. The football club MSV Studénka and ice hockey club HC Studénka play in the lower amateur tiers.

Sights

The Studénka Castle is formed by two Baroque buildings, known as Old Castle and New Castle. The Old Castle was built in 1705 and the New Castle in 1750. A tower was added in 1860–1863. Today the castle is used for cultural and commercial purposes and houses ceremonial hall, library, elementary art school, and Railway Cars Museum.

The most valuable sacral building is the parish Church of Saint Bartholomew. It was built in neo-Gothic style in 1880 on the site of an older wooden church from the early 16th century.

Populated places in Nový Jičín DistrictPeire d'Alvernhe or d'Alvernha (Pèire in modern Occitan; b. c. 1130) was an Auvergnat troubadour (active 1149–1170) with twenty-one or twenty-four surviving works. He composed in an ""esoteric"" and ""formally complex"" style known as the trobar clus. He stands out as the earliest troubadour mentioned by name in Dante's Divine Comedy.

Life
According to his vida, Peire was a burgher's son from the Diocese of Clermont. As testified to by his vida, his popularity was great within his lifetime and afterwards. Said to be handsome, charming, wise, and learned, he was ""the first good inventor of poetry to go beyond the mountains"" (i.e. the Pyrenees) and travel in Spain. He passed his time in Spain at the court of Alfonso VII of Castile and that of his son Sancho III in 1157–1158. It is possible that he was present at a meeting between Sancho of Castile, Sancho VI of Navarre and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona in 1158. The author of his vida, editorialising, considers his poems to have been the greatest until Giraut de Borneill and his melodies to have been the best ever. The anonymous biographer records that his information about Peire's later years comes from Dalfi d'Alvernha. It has been suggested that Dalfi was the author of the vida.

According to an accusation of fellow troubadour Bernart Marti, Peire entered upon a religious life early, but quit Holy Orders for a life of itinerant minstrelsy. He may be the same person as the Petrus d'Alvengue and Petrus de Alvernia who appear in surviving documents from Montpellier dated to the year 1148. Peire appears to have cultivated the favour of the ruling family of the Crown of Aragon, and his poems contain allusions to the counts of Barcelona and Provence. Perhaps he was following the fashion of the lords of Montpellier of his time, who, though vassals of the Count of Toulouse, were partial to the Aragonese. At the same time Peire did garner the support of Raymond V of Toulouse. In his wanderings he may have spent some time at Cortezon, at the court of the minor nobleman and troubadour Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Peire lived a long into old age, and performed penance before dying.

Poetry
Peire wrote mostly cansos, which, as his vida points out, were called vers in his day. He also invented the ""pious song"" and wrote six such poems dealing with serious themes of religion, piety, and spirituality. Even in his more profane works, however, one can detect the moralising influence of Marcabru, with whom in whose old age he was possibly acquainted. One of Marcabru's late songs is a satire of an early one by Peire d'Alvernhe. Marcabru's complexity was also imparted to Peire.

On the topic of courtly love, Peire, who had abandoned the religious life early, came to abandon the claims of fin'amor (""fine love"") later. When Peire espouses love of the Holy Ghost over cortez' amors de bon aire (""well-spirited courtly love"") he is the only troubadour to ever use the term ""courtly love"". Marcabrunian influence can be seen here too. In a later Crusade song, Peire defended Marcabru's abandonment of the carnal amar. He advocates gran sabers ni purs (""great and pure wisdom"") through bon'amor (""good love""). Along with Bernart Marti, Bernart de Venzac, and Gavaudan, Peire was part of a ""Marcabrunian school"". Nonetheless, as mentioned above, Bernart Marti attacked Peire for claiming superior spiritual status:
E quan canorgues si mes
Pey d'Alvernh'en canongia,
a Dieu per que.s prometia
entiers que peuys si fraysses?
Quar si feys, fols joglars es
per que l'entiers pretz cambia.
Peire's aesthetic philosophy esteemed the ""whole song"" (vers entiers), which is what he termed his completed pieces, denigrating all others' works as incomplete and imperfect. Nonetheless, from Marcabru Peire picked up a notion of the trobar braus as a legitimate format for ""rough"" themes.

One anonymous song of the Fifth Crusade, Lo Senhre que formet lo tro, written between Spring 1213 and July 1214 has been attributed to Peire d'Alvernhe, but the dating makes that impossible. In a tenso between a Bernart (probably Bernart de Ventadorn) and an unnamed Peire, perhaps Peire d'Alvernhe, the latter argues that ""it is not becoming for ladies to make love-pleas; it is fitting that men plead with them and beg their mercy.""

By far, however, Peire's most famous work is Chantarai d'aquest trobadors, a sirventes written at Puivert (Puoich-vert) in which he ridicules twelve contemporary troubadours (""a poetical gallery"") and praises himself. It has been conjectured that this piece was first performed in the presence of all twelve of the ridiculed poets in late Summer 1170 while an embassy bringing Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England, to her Spanish groom Alfonso VIII of Castile sojourned at Puivert. If the above date is not accepted, it can be probably dated later than 1165—since Giraut de Borneill was only active from c.1170—and certainly before 1173, when Raimbaut d'Aurenga died. The Monge de Montaudon later composed a parody of Peire's satire, Pos Peire d'Alvernhl a chantat.

Chantarai d'aquest trobadors is near universally regarded today as playful parody and not as a work of serious literary or artistic criticism. The obscurity of most of the ridiculed poets and the attack upon such personal characteristics as appearance and manners has been cited in support of the view that the parody was done in the presence of all twelve victims, further supporting the conclusion that the parody was good-natured. Besides the criticism of a personal nature, many of the criticism launched by Peire allude to the works of the others, notably those of Bernart de Ventadorn and Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Music
Peire's vida acclaimed him an accomplished singer and the greatest composer of melodies for verses yet known. Peire's famous Chantarai d'aquest trobadors contains a final tornada indicating its musical nature, though its own melody has not survived:

Only two of Peire's melodies still exist: one of Dejosta.ls breus jorns e.ls lonc sers, a canso, and another of his tenso. Modern notations of both are provided in Aubrey, The Music of the Troubadours.

On the whole, Peire's music is more melismatic than that typical of the troubadours and it mimics the trobar clus style of his lyrics.

It is noted as The Miracles' last studio album with original lead singer Smokey Robinson, who retired from the act to concentrate on his duties as Vice President of The Motown Record Corporation. The album charted at #46 on the Billboard Pop Album chart, and featured two singles: the appropriately named ""We've Come Too Far to End It Now"", which matched the parent album's chart position on the Billboard singles chart, charting at #46, and reached the Top 10 of the Billboard R&B singles chart, charting at #9, and ""I Can't Stand to See You Cry"", which charted at #45 Pop, and #21 R&B.

The album also featured a cover of The Stylistics' 1971 hit ""Betcha By Golly Wow"", the ""Theme from Love Story"", and covers of the Michael Jackson solo hit, ""Got to Be There"" (featuring outstanding guitar work by Miracle Marv Tarplin), and The Chi-Lites'#1 hit, ""Oh Girl"". The album also features songs composed by Ashford & Simpson, Stevie Wonder and Syretta Wright, Bobby Miller, who was responsible for The Dells' long string of hits, and Motown producer Johnny Bristol, but curiously neither Smokey nor any of the other Miracles contributed to the writing on this album and Smokey himself produced only two tracks, the aforementioned ""Got to Be There"" and ""Love Story"".

The release of this album coincided with the group's final nationwide tour, before replacing Smokey with Billy Griffin. As of 2018, Flying High Together has yet to be issued on CD, but several of its songs have shown up on various Miracles foreign and domestic CD compilations. The Miracles' next studio album was 1973's Billy Griffin-led Renaissance.

The band was composed of Scottish-born David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), drummer Chris Frantz, bassist Tina Weymouth, and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as ""one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s"", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with an anxious, clean-cut image.

As former art school students who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their 1977 debut album, Talking Heads: 77, to positive reviews. They collaborated with producer Brian Eno on a trio of critically acclaimed releases—More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980)—which blended their art school punk sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti. By the early 1980s, they began to expand their band by including a number of additional musicians in recording sessions and stage shows, notably guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.

After a hiatus, Talking Heads hit their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Top 10 hit ""Burning Down the House"" from the album Speaking in Tongues and released the concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme. For these performances, the band was joined by Worrell, guitarist Alex Weir, percussionist Steve Scales, and singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt. In 1985, Talking Heads released their best-selling album, Little Creatures. They produced a soundtrack album for Byrne' film True Stories (1986), and released their final album, worldbeat-influenced Naked (1988), before disbanding in 1991. Without Byrne, the other band members performed under the name Shrunken Heads, and released an album, No Talking, Just Head, as the Heads in 1996.

In 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their albums appear in Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and three of their songs (""Psycho Killer"", ""Life During Wartime"", and ""Once in a Lifetime"") were included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Talking Heads were also number 64 on VH1's list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In the 2011 update of Rolling Stones ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"", they were ranked number 100.

History

1973-1977: Early years
In 1973, Rhode Island School of Design students David Byrne (guitar and vocals) and Chris Frantz (drums) formed a band, the Artistics. Fellow student Tina Weymouth, Frantz's girlfriend, often provided transportation. The Artistics dissolved the following year, and the three moved to New York City, eventually sharing a communal loft. After they were unable to find a bassist, Weymouth took up the role. Frantz encouraged Weymouth to learn to play bass by listening to Suzi Quatro albums. Byrne asked Weymouth to audition three times before she joined the band.

The band played their first gig as Talking Heads opening for the Ramones at CBGB on June 5, 1975. According to Weymouth, the name Talking Heads came from an issue of TV Guide, which ""explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as 'all content, no action'. It fit."" Later that year, the band recorded a series of demos for CBS, but did not earn a record contract. However, they drew a following and signed to Sire Records in November 1976. They released their first single in February the following year, ""Love → Building on Fire"". In March 1977, they added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band the Modern Lovers, on keyboards, guitar, and backing vocals.

The first Talking Heads album, Talking Heads: 77, received acclaim and produced their first charting single, ""Psycho Killer"". Many connected the song to the serial killer known as the Son of Sam, who had been terrorizing New York City months earlier; however, Byrne said he had written the song years prior. Weymouth and Frantz married in 1977.

1978–1980: Collaborations with Eno

More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978) was Talking Heads' first collaboration with producer Brian Eno, who had previously worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie, John Cale and Robert Fripp; the title of Eno's 1977 song ""King's Lead Hat"" is an anagram of the band's name. Eno's unusual style meshed with the group's artistic sensibilities, and they began to explore an increasingly diverse range of musical directions, from post-punk to psychedelic funk to African music, influenced prominently by Fela Kuti and Parliament-Funkadelic. This recording also established the band's relationship with Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. More Songs About Buildings and Food included a cover of Al Green's ""Take Me to the River"". This broke Talking Heads into the general public's consciousness and gave the band their first Billboard Top 30 hit.

The collaboration continued with Fear of Music (1979), with the darker stylings of post-punk rock, mixed with white funkadelia and subliminal references to the geopolitical instability of the late 1970s. Music journalist Simon Reynolds cited Fear of Music as representing the Eno-Talking Heads collaboration ""at its most mutually fruitful and equitable"". The single ""Life During Wartime"" produced the catchphrase ""This ain't no party, this ain't no disco."" The song refers to the Mudd Club and CBGB, two popular New York nightclubs of the time.

Remain in Light (1980) was heavily influenced by the afrobeat of Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti, whose music Eno had introduced to the band. It explored West African polyrhythms, weaving these together with Arabic music from North Africa, disco funk, and ""found"" voices. These combinations foreshadowed Byrne's later interest in world music. In order to perform these more complex arrangements, the band toured with an expanded group, including Adrian Belew and Bernie Worrell, among others, first at the Heatwave festival in August, and later in their concert film Stop Making Sense. During this period, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz also formed a commercially successful splinter group, Tom Tom Club, influenced by the foundational elements of hip hop, and Harrison released his first solo album, The Red and the Black. Likewise, Byrne—in collaboration with Eno—released My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, which incorporated world music and found sounds, as well as including a number of other prominent international and post-punk musicians. All were released by Sire.

Remain in Lights lead single, ""Once in a Lifetime"", became a Top 20 hit in the UK, but initially failed to make an impression in the USA. It grew into a popular standard over the next few years on the strength of its music video, which was named one of Time's All-TIME Best Music Videos.

1981–1991: Commercial peak and breakup
After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2.

1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, ""Burning Down the House"". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last.

Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles ""And She Was"" and ""Road to Nowhere""), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, ""Wild Wild Life"", and the accordion-driven track ""Radio Head"". Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on ""hiatus"". In 1987 Talking Heads released a book by David Byrne called What the Songs Look Like: Contemporary Artists Interpret Talking Heads Songs with Harper Collins that contained artwork by some of the top New York visual artists of the decade.

In December 1991, Talking Heads announced that they had disbanded. Frantz said that he learned that Byrne had left from an article in the Los Angeles Times, and said: ""As far as we're concerned, the band never really broke up. David just decided to leave."" Their final release was ""Sax and Violins"", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in 1990.

1992–2002: Post-breakup and final reunion
Weymouth, Frantz, and Harrison toured without Byrne as Shrunken Heads in the early 90s. In 1996, they released an album, No Talking, Just Head, under the name the Heads. The album featured a number of vocalists, including Gavin Friday of The Virgin Prunes, Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. It was accompanied by a tour with Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action to prevent the band using the name The Heads, which he saw as ""a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name"". The band briefly reunited in 1999 to promote the 15th anniversary re-release of Stop Making Sense, but did not perform together.

Harrison produced records including the Violent Femmes' The Blind Leading the Naked, the Fine Young Cannibals' The Raw and the Cooked, General Public's Rub It Better, Crash Test Dummies' God Shuffled His Feet, Live's Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper and The Distance to Here, No Doubt's song ""New"" from Return of Saturn. Frantz and Weymouth have produced several artists, including Happy Mondays and Ziggy Marley. The Tom Tom Club continue to record and tour intermittently.
Talking Heads reunited to play ""Life During Wartime"", ""Psycho Killer"", and ""Burning Down the House"" on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, joined on stage by former touring members Bernie Worrell and Steve Scales. Byrne said further work together was unlikely, due to ""bad blood"" and being musically ""miles apart"". Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as ""a man incapable of returning friendship"" and saying that he doesn't ""love"" her, Frantz, and Harrison.

Influence
AllMusic stated that Talking Heads, one of the most celebrated bands of the 1970s and 1980s, by the time of their breakup ""had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop"". Talking Heads' art pop innovations have had a long-lasting impact. Along with other groups such as Devo, Ramones, and Blondie, they helped define the new wave genre in the United States. Meanwhile, the more worldly popularities like 1980's Remain in Light helped bring African rock to the western world.  Their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme, was critically acclaimed upon its theatrical release, and is considered one of the best concert films ever released.

Talking Heads have been cited as an influence by many artists, including Eddie Vedder, Foals, the Weeknd, Vampire Weekend, Primus, Bell X1, the 1975, the Ting Tings, Nelly Furtado, Kesha, St. Vincent, Danny Brown, Trent Reznor, Franz Ferdinand and Radiohead, who took their name from the Talking Heads song ""Radio Head"" from the 1986 album True Stories. The Italian filmmaker and director Paolo Sorrentino, in receiving the Oscar for his film La Grande Bellezza in 2014, thanked Talking Heads, among others, as his sources of inspiration.

18,251,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type0,"Nicholas Clayton Mullens (born March 21, 1995) is an American football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles, where he surpassed Brett Favre's single-season record for passing yardage (4,476) and touchdown passes (38). He played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2017 to 2020. Mullens also played for the Philadelphia Eagles.

Early life
Mullens was born to Suzanne and Mark Mullens on March 21, 1995 in Little Rock, Arkansas and grew up in Hoover, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham. He is the grandson of Ernie Tabor, who pitched in the Philadelphia Phillies minor league system in the 1950s. His uncle, Scott Tabor, pitched for the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team, and holds the school record for most career wins. He also pitched professionally in the minor leagues. Mullens graduated from Spain Park High School in Hoover.

High school career
Mullens played football for Spain Park, emerging as the team's starting quarterback. During his senior season, 2012, Mullens threw for 3,649 yards and 40 touchdowns, against only seven interceptions, en route to winning the 2012 Gatorade Player of the Year award for the state of Alabama. He had totaled 8,605 career passing yards, finishing his high school career with the 7th most passing yards in AHSAA history, to go along with 40 passing touchdowns.

After originally verbally committing to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Mullens changed course on national signing day following a last-minute visit to the University of Southern Mississippi, signing instead with the Golden Eagles.

College career
After starting the 2013 season with a 0–6 record, mired in an 18-game losing streak, Southern Miss head coach Todd Monken inserted true freshman Mullens as a starter for game seven, a home game against the North Texas Mean Green. The young team was overmatched by North Texas, however, suffering a 55–14 loss in which Mullens went 12-for-31 passing for 210 yards and one touchdown, while suffering three interceptions and a lost fumble.

In his second collegiate game, a loss to Marshall, Mullens became the first true freshman starting quarterback in Southern Miss history to pass for more than 300 yards in a single game, a feat never accomplished during his freshman year by the school's most famous football alumnus, Brett Favre.

On November 30, 2013, Mullens played a key role in helping Southern Miss end its losing streak at 24 games with a five-touchdown performance against the University of Alabama-Birmingham, which also happened to be the college that he originally committed to.

Mullens passed for 1,776 yards as a freshman in 2013. As a sophomore in 2014, he started 10 games and completed 218 of 365 attempts for 2,470 passing yards and 12 touchdowns.

In the 2015 regular season, Mullens completed 331 of 521 passes (63.5%) for 4,476 yards and 38 touchdowns — school records for passing yardage and touchdown passes. He ranked sixth among NCAA Division I FBS quarterbacks in passing yardage. Mullens' efforts were instrumental in a reversal of fortunes of the Southern Miss football program, with the team posting a 9–5 record for the year just two seasons after snapping its abysmal 24-game losing streak. He started all 14 games as the Golden Eagles finished with more than 7,000 yards of offense for the first time in school history.

In 2016, Mullen made 11 starts and completed 243 of 384 attempts, for 3,272 yards and 24 touchdowns, averaging 297.5 passing yards per game. 
On October 1, 2016, against the Rice Owls, he threw for a collegiate career-high 591 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in the 44–28 victory.

In four seasons at Southern Miss (2013–2016), Mullens played in 44 games (41 starts) and completed 928 of 1,546 attempts for 11,994 yards and 87 touchdowns. He finished his collegiate career as the career passing leader in every statistical category. His 11,994 yards passing and 87 touchdown passes dwarfed the 7,695 yards and 52 touchdowns registered by former NFL great Brett Favre during his four years with the Golden Eagles.

Statistics

Professional career

San Francisco 49ers

2017 season

On May 4, 2017, Mullens signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent. He entered training camp as the fourth backup quarterback on the depth chart behind veterans Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley, and rookie C. J. Beathard.

On September 2, 2017, Mullens was waived as part of the 49ers' final roster cuts, but he was signed to the practice squad the next day. On January 2, 2018, the 49ers signed Mullens to a reserve/futures contract after he spent his entire rookie season on the practice squad.

2018 season

On September 1, 2018, Mullens was waived by the 49ers and was signed to the practice squad the next day. On September 26, 2018, the 49ers promoted Mullens to their active roster after starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL and was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season. The terms of his new contract were for two years and $1.05 million.

On November 1, 2018, Mullens was named the starter for the 49ers' Week 9 game against the Oakland Raiders on Thursday Night Football after Beathard suffered a wrist injury in the previous game against the Arizona Cardinals. Mullens finished his NFL debut and first NFL start completing 16 of 22 pass attempts for 262 yards and three touchdowns as the 49ers won 34–3. His passer rating of 151.9 was the highest since 1970 for a quarterback with at least 20 passing attempts in a debut. Mullens was also the first player in 49ers history to throw three touchdowns in his first game for the team. He completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Pierre Garçon in the first quarter to mark his first NFL touchdown. The following week against the New York Giants, Mullens threw for 250 yards, one touchdown, and was intercepted twice by linebacker BJ Goodson as the 49ers lost by a score of 27–23 on Monday Night Football. Mullens made his first road start during Week 12. Facing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he threw for 221 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions as the 49ers lost by a score of 27–9. During Week 13 against the Seattle Seahawks, Mullens finished with a career-high 414 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the 49ers lost by a score of 43–16. In Week 14 against the Denver Broncos, he passed for 332 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the 49ers won by a score of 20–14. In Week 15, Mullens threw for 275 yards and a touchdown to help the 49ers defeat the Seattle Seahawks in overtime by a score of 26–23, marking the first time the 49ers beat the Seahawks since 2013. In the regular-season finale against the Los Angeles Rams, he finished with 282 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions in the 48–32 loss.

Mullens finished the 2018 season with 2,277 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and ten interceptions.

2019 season

During the 2019 season, Mullens primarily served as the backup to Jimmy Garoppolo. He only appeared in one game in the 2019 season. The 49ers reached Super Bowl LIV, but the team lost 31–20 to the Kansas City Chiefs.

2020 season

On March 5, 2020, Mullens was assigned a one-year, $750,000 exclusive-rights free agent tender by the 49ers. He signed the contract on May 1, 2020. On September 20, 2020 in a game against the New York Jets, Mullens came in after halftime after Jimmy Garoppolo suffered a leg injury. In the game, Mullens completed 8 of 11 passes for 71 yards and an interception in a 31–13 victory. Mullens was named the starter for Week 3 against the New York Giants. In the 36–9 victory, he passed for 343 yards and one touchdown.  In Week 4 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Mullens posted a career low passer rating of 72.6 in which he threw a pick six to linebacker Alex Singleton, thus resulting in Mullens getting benched for C. J. Beathard. Without Mullens, the 49ers would lose 25–20 to the Eagles. 

In Week 8 against the Seattle Seahawks, Mullens came into the game in the fourth quarter after Jimmy Garoppolo left the game with an ankle injury. Mullens rallied the 49ers back in the game by completing 18 of 25 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns but the 49ers lost 27–37. Mullens was named the starter for the 49ers again for the 49ers' Thursday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers due to Garoppolo being sidelined indefinitely due to his ankle injury. In Week 13, against the Buffalo Bills, he had 316 passing yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 34–24 loss.

On December 22, 2020, it was announced that Mullens would miss the rest of the season with an elbow injury he suffered in the 49ers 41–33 loss against the Dallas Cowboys. He was placed on injured reserve three days later. Mullens was scheduled to become a restricted free agent following the season, but the team did not extend a tender to him at the start of the new league year and he became an unrestricted free agent.

Philadelphia Eagles
On June 14, 2021, Mullens signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. On August 28, 2021, Mullens was waived by the Eagles.

Cleveland Browns
Mullens was signed to the Cleveland Browns' practice squad on September 1, 2021. Mullens was elevated to the Browns' active roster on October 21, 2021 prior to their game that evening, and reverted to the practice squad the following day. 

For the Week 15 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders, Mullens was named the starting quarterback after the Browns experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, which included fellow quarterbacks Baker Mayfield and Case Keenum testing positive. In addition, the game was moved from Saturday, December 18, to Monday, December 20, the first game of the season to be postponed due to COVID-19. During the game, Mullens threw a touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter, giving the Browns the lead. Derek Carr subsequently led a successful drive down the field, which ended with the Raiders kicking a field goal and winning 16–14. Mullens completed 20 of 30 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown in the loss before reverting back to the practice squad later that week.

Cleveland Browns playersWilliam Barry Holmes (6 January 1928 – 10 November 1949) was a rugby union player who played for the England national rugby union team and the Argentina national rugby union team. As of 2011 he is the only player to have been capped at senior level by both those two countries.

Holmes was born in Buenos Aires on 6 January 1928 to British parents. He was educated at St. George's College, Quilmes, and began his rugby union career playing for the Old Georgian Club in Buenos Aires. He travelled to Britain to continue his education at Queens' College, Cambridge and was selected to play for Cambridge University R.U.F.C. in The Varsity Match twice, playing on the wing in 1947 and at fullback in 1948. Holmes returned to Argentina in 1948 as part of the 1948 Oxford-Cambridge rugby union tour of Argentina, a touring team made up of players from both Cambridge University RUFC and Oxford University RFC which won all nine of its tour matches, including two against the Argentina national team.

Holmes's form for Cambridge University in the 1948–49 season led to two appearances in the trial matches for the England team and also an invitation to play for the Barbarians in their annual fixture against Leicester. His performance in the second trial match clinched his selection at fullback in England's team for their opening match of the 1949 Five Nations Championship against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park and he retained his place for the whole championship. Holmes won four caps for England and scored a conversion in each match against Ireland and France for a total of four points.

After playing on the Barbarians' 1949 tour of South Wales, Holmes returned to live in Argentina and was selected for the national team after only two games for Old Georgians. He was capped twice for Argentina against France in August and September 1949 but did not score any points. He was married in November 1949 and moved to Salta but died of typhoid fever on 10 November 1949, less than a week after his wedding.

England rugby historian Barry Bowker described Holmes as a ""steady fullback"" while Clem Thomas, a teammate at Cambridge and a Wales international himself, called him ""a marvellous man and a great footballer"" and said that the news of his death ""depressed us enormously"".

The park is by far the largest of 24 state parks in Indiana, and occupies —making it one of the larger state parks in the United States.  It is Indiana's most visited state park, and has about 1.3 million visitors each year.  Although Bloomington, Indiana, is the closest city, the park is closer to the small town of Nashville in Brown County.  Brown County is named for General Jacob Brown, who fought in the War of 1812 and became Commanding General of the United States Army.

The park opened in 1929, and was dedicated in 1932 as a memorial to Indiana humorist Frank McKinney ""Kin"" Hubbard.  Although Hubbard lived and worked in Indianapolis, he was a frequent visitor to Nashville and the surrounding woods.  The park's Abe Martin Lodge is named after Hubbard's fictional backwoodsmen character used to convey Hubbard's humor and witticisms.

Brown County and its park are known for their scenic views of the hills of southern Indiana.  Both are the home of a wide variety of trees that attract visitors each year when the vegetation transforms to its autumn colors.  The park also contains many trees that flower in the springtime.  Visitors will find a rustic atmosphere, enhanced by an infrastructure that was mostly constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.  In addition to the park's lodge, cabins can be rented and campsites are available.  The park has trails for hiking, biking and horseback riding.  It has two lakes for fishing that complement the surrounding forests and provide a water source for the local wildlife.  The area's beauty attracts artists and photographers worldwide.

History

Brown County
Brown County was created in 1836 from portions of Monroe, Jackson, and Bartholomew counties, and is named after General Jacob Brown, a hero of the War of 1812.  Early settlers tried farming in Brown County's hilly woodlands, leading them to clear the forests.  Beginning in the 1840s and continuing for the rest of the century, most of Brown County's forests were cleared.  At first, the largest trees were cut for lumber used in the construction industry.  In later years, smaller trees were cleared for furniture wood, barrels, railroad ties, and firewood.  The rugged land eventually became difficult to farm because of poor quality soil.  A combination of poor farming practices and erosion caused by deforestation depleted the soil's nutrients.  Many farmers abandoned the area.

Beginning
At least two people played major roles in the creation of Brown County State Park.  Richard Lieber, an Indianapolis businessman who became the first director of the Indiana Department of Conservation, visited Brown County in 1910.  Lieber was so impressed with the beauty of the land that he built a cabin near Nashville and suggested that a portion of the county should be set aside for a state park.  Lieber eventually became known as ""the father of Indiana's state parks"", and the state opened 10 state parks (including Brown County) during his tenure as director of the Indiana Department of Conservation.  Lieber was not the only one from Indianapolis that was impressed with Brown County.  In 1923, the Order of Elks expressed interest in establishing a state park in Brown County.

Lee Bright lived in the small Indiana town of Nashville in Brown County.  Bright believed that creation of a state park would restore the economic health of the region through tourism. His idea proved difficult to accomplish, since Indiana law did not allow purchasing land for a state park using state funds.  The law did allow funds to be used for a game preserve.  By 1926, Bright, working as the state's agent, purchased enough land to start a game reserve in Brown County.

Game preserve
Brown County's game preserve was created in late 1924.  During November, 1924, the Indiana Department of Conservation appointed a game warden to manage the preserve.  The new manager was a resident of Nashville, and familiar with the area.  It was also announced that much of the land would be reforested.  A total of   of Brown County land was designated for the propagation of wildlife.  Plans were made to surround the reserve with wire fencing, and game wardens patrolled the area.  Deer and small game were brought in to propagate.  Additional acreage was added in 1927, increasing the reserve to over . During the same year, an observation tower was constructed on Weed Patch Hill, the highest point in the area.  A dam was constructed in 1928 to create an artificial lake that was expected to cover .  It was planned to stock the lake with game fish then allow fishing after two or three years.  The lake was completed by the spring of 1929, and plans were announced to build a second (and larger) lake.  By January 1929, the preserve covered about .  Funds from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses were used to acquire the additional land.

State Park
In 1927, the Indiana state legislature passed a law allowing county commissioners to acquire land for the purpose of establishing a state park, and donate the land to the state conservation department.  Brown County State Park was the fourth such park established after this legislation.  In 1929, Brown County commissioners gave the state conservation department  of land adjacent to the Brown County Game Preserve for the creation of a state park. Four parks had been donated using other means before the legislation, making Brown County State Park Indiana's eighth state park.

In 1933, eleven Civilian Conservation Corps groups were established for Indiana's state forests, game preserves, and state parks.  Each group had 200 workers involved in the construction of buildings, bridges, trails, roads, and water supplies.  One project was a large shelter in the Brown County game preserve.  After training, workers from the Corps arrived in Brown County in 1934.  The Corps began constructing much of the park's extant infrastructure.  They worked to prevent erosion by reforesting with walnut, pine, and spruce trees.  A second camp for the Civilian Conservation Corps opened in the park in 1938.  The CCC Trail—the park's Trail 2—is one built by the Corps.  The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020 for its CCC elements.

Beginning in 1941, the Brown County Game Preserve and Brown County State Park were unified as a single state park. Since that time, two portions of the park have been designated as nature preserves—giving them additional protection from development.  Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve was established in 1970 and consists of  in Ogle Hollow containing the rare yellowwood tree. The second preserve is the  Ten O'Clock Line Nature Preserve.  This preserve was designated in 2010, and is Indiana's largest.  It also contains yellowwood trees, and is the home of some of Indiana's deep forest species, including the red bat, timber rattlesnake, and broad-winged hawk. The term ""Ten O'Clock Line"" refers to a treaty with the Miami Indians from the early 1800s.

The 1987 Pan American Games, hosted in Indianapolis (roughly  north), utilized Brown County State Park as the venue for the road race cycling competition.

Kin Hubbard
Frank McKinney ""Kin"" Hubbard (1868 – 1930) was an American humorist-cartoonist whose humor and witticisms were expressed through fictional backwoods characters living in Brown County.  His work (usually a cartoon and a sentence or two) appeared every day on the back page of the Indianapolis News, and was syndicated in about 200 newspapers throughout the country.   Hubbard was named to the Ohio Journalism Hall of Fame in 1939, and the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 1967.

In 1932, Brown County State Park was dedicated in honor of Kin Hubbard.  Abe Martin was Hubbard's main character, and Brown County State Park's Abe Martin Lodge is named in his honor.  A picture of Hubbard hangs in the lounge of the lodge, and a collection of Hubbard memorabilia is in a room nearby.

Description
Brown County State Park is the largest of the 24 state parks managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.  It is in the center of Indiana's southern half, ""just minutes"" from the town of Nashville, Indiana.  The park occupies  in Brown County.  It has three entrances, adjacent to state roads 46 and  135.  The northern entrance is close to the Abe Martin Lodge, Saddle Barn, tennis courts and a swimming pool.  Large trucks and recreational vehicles must use the western entrance, due to a historic covered bridge that has a 3-ton weight limit and a 9' overhead clearance at the northern entrance.  Campers bringing horses must use the southeast entrance, which leads to a specialized campground with hitching posts known as the Horsemen's Camp.  Interstate 65's Columbus exit is about  east of the park.  Indiana University and the city of Bloomington, Indiana, are less than  away.

Brown County is nationally known for its outdoor scenery and dramatic views from southern Indiana hilltops.  Brown County State Park affords a number of vistas that overlook wide swaths of deciduous forest that display a large array of colors in the fall.  Peak visitation is in the fall during the leaf-changing season.   In spring the dogwood, redbud, and serviceberry trees are in bloom.  About 1.3 million people come to the park each year, including overseas visitors.

Brown County State Park is sometimes called ""the Little Smokies"" because of similarities with the Great Smoky Mountains.  Activities available in the park include camping, fishing, biking, hiking, and seasonal horseback riding.  Many of these activities are available all year.  Overnight visitors may stay in the campgrounds, rental cabins, or the Abe Martin Lodge.  The park has a nature center and a nature preserve.  Within the park boundaries are two manmade lakes: the  Ogle Lake, and  Strahl Lake.  The park contains nine mountain bike trails totaling .  Four of the trails are rated as beginner trails, two are considered intermediate, and two advanced.  The last trail is rated for experts and is  long.  A total of slightly over  of hiking trails range from easy to rugged terrain.  The park has over  of roads and  of bridle trails.  The third highest point in Indiana is located on Trail 10 near a  high fire tower.  This point, known as Weed Patch Hill, has an elevation of .  When settlers first arrived at this hill, they found only a patch of weeds—a tornado had destroyed the trees—leading to the name.  Hesitation Point is another vantage point for scenic views.

Natural resources

Flora

The most important tree in the park is the stain (Cladrastis lutea).  This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana.  Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark).  The park also contains at least two types of maple trees:  black, sugar, red and silver. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows.  Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm.  Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash.  The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.

Fauna
Mammals typically found in Brown County State Park include white-tailed deer, bobcats, opossum, eastern gray squirrels, and chipmunks.  The larger sycamore trees are sometimes the home of raccoons and flying squirrels.  Red bats live in the park's Ten O'Clock Line nature preserve.  Other animals include the American toad, the eastern box turtle, the spotted salamander, and the red-backed salamander.  Two species of venomous snakes are native to the park: the timber rattlesnake and the copperhead.  The two lakes contain bass and bluegill.

The park has good bird viewing areas along the trails, near the two lakes, and at the Nature Center. The hooded warbler, pileated woodpecker, and ruffed grouse nest in the park.  Goldfinches and northern cardinals can be seen at feeders near the Nature Center.  The pileated woodpecker, Acadian flycatcher, eastern wood pewee, white-breasted nuthatch, wood thrush, and yellow-billed cuckoo can all be observed in the park's Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve.  Owls and woodpeckers are known to occupy sycamore trees.  The cerulean warbler, whippoorwill, and broad-winged hawk all live in the Ten O'Clock Nature Preserve.  Wild turkeys can be seen (and heard) along the park's Trail 10, known as the Fire Tower Trail.  Other bird species in the park include the blue jay, the crow, the junco, the white-breasted nuthatch, and the robin.

Geology
Glaciers from the most recent ice ages did not reach south far enough to flatten the land in Brown County, though glacier meltwater helped deepen gullies in the region, and made hills steeper.  Brown County State Park's Weed Patch Hill is the highest point in the area, at  above sea level.  The region is part of the Knobstone Escarpment land form, which consists of steep hills and valleys located between northern Brown County and the Ohio River.  The rocks in this area contain significant amounts of silica, and were part of a large delta system over 330 million years ago.  Brown County's rocks are part of the Borden Group, and are mostly siltstone.  Limestone, dolomite, and chert are the Borden Group's secondary rocks.

Climate
The Brown County area has a humid subtropical climate, classified as ""Cfa"" in the Köppen climate classification system. Precipitation is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, and temperatures can be relatively high.  The record high temperature over the last 99 years for county seat Nashville is .  The record low over the last 99 years is .  May is the month with the most precipitation, and February has the least.  Most of the area's snowfall occurs in December, January, and February.

Recreation and facilities

Places to stay
The park's Abe Martin Lodge, built in 1932, has 30 guest rooms, two lobbies, a gift shop, and a full-service restaurant.  An annex to the lodge has 54 more rooms.  An indoor water park was added recently.  Rental cabins are available nearby.  Each of 20 two-story family cabins can accommodate up to 8 people, and 56 rustic cabins are available.  Campers have the choice of two classes of campgrounds—all with restrooms and showers.  The Class A campgrounds have electrical hook-ups, while the Class B do not.  A horseman's campground is available with one portion having electrical hook-ups, showers, and toilets—while the other portion is more primitive.

Activities
Sight seeing, birdwatching, mountain biking, fishing, hiking and horse riding are all popular activities at Brown County State park.  The park has over  of mountain bike trails, including trails endorsed by the International Mountain Bicycling Association and Bike Magazine.  Four beginner trails are  to  long.  The expert trail is  long. During July 2018, Bicycling magazine named Brown County one of ""The Top 6 Secret Mountain Bike Destinations in the US"", and listed the park's recently completed Hobbs Hollow as a must-ride trail.

Fishing is available at two lakes to holders of a state fishing license.  Bass and bluegill are stocked at Ogle Lake and the smaller Strahl Lake.  Rowboats and electric trolling motors are permitted on Ogle Lake to holders of an Indiana Department of Natural Resources lake permit.  Boats are not allowed on Strahl Lake.  Licenses and permits are available at the park office, and bait at the park's country store.

The park has 12 hiking trails that total over .  These trails can be used to access places of interest in the park, including the two lakes, the Ogle Hollow Nature Preserve, Hesitation Point, and lookout towers.  The CCC Trail is a moderate difficulty  trail built by the Civilian Conservation Corps.  This trail ""crosses over impressive stone bridges, stairways, and retaining walls and passes by the Lower Shelter and the North Lookout Tower, both CCC projects"".

Horseback riding is one of the fastest growing forms of recreation.  Brown County State Park has over 20 horse trails, and 11 are wide enough that riders can ride two abreast.  These trails range from  to nearly  in length. Horseback riders have their own entrance to the park, in the park's southeast corner, which leads to the horsemen's campground—also in the southeast of the park. There are facilities typical of the park's regular and primitive campgrounds and hitch rails.  A maximum of six horses per campsite is allowed, and horse permits are mandatory.  On the other side of the park, a saddle barn is open from late March through October.  Trail rides with a guide, pony rides, and hayrides are available.  The barn is located on the north side of the park, not far from the Abe Martin Lodge.

Winter sports include cross-country skiing, sledding, and ice fishing.  Cross-country skiing can be done in open fields within the park, though the park does not maintain any trails specifically for skiing, and does not rent ski equipment.  Some hills suitable for sledding are located near the park's swimming pool.  Ice fishing is allowed at both lakes for those with a state fishing license.  Roads to the lakes sometimes closed due to ice or snow.

Other facilities
A country store is open during the warm season with food, firewood, souvenirs, and bait for fishing.  The nature center has a bird observation window and nature exhibits.  The country store and nature center are located in the southern portion of the park.  A swimming pool and tennis courts are located on the north side near the Abe Martin Lodge.  The Olympic-size swimming pool is open from Memorial Day to no later than Labor Day.  The park has at least 10 picnic areas, with tables and grills and some with nearby playgrounds and toilet facilities.  Picnic shelters can be reserved for fees that vary by shelter.

Animals described in 1978John G. Fary (April 11, 1911 – June 7, 1984) was a U.S. Representative from Illinois. He represented the Illinois's 5th congressional district

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Fary attended Saint Peter and Paul grammar school and graduated from Holy Trinity High School. His father was a tavern owner. He grew up in the ""Back of the Yards""/McKinley Park neighborhood of Chicago's Southside. He attended Loyola University Chicago, Real Estate School of Illinois and Mid-West Institute. He served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1955 to 1975. In the legislature, he sponsored and co-sponsored bills to assist tavern owners and senior citizens and once sponsored a bill to raise the speed limit on Illinois highways to 80 miles an hour. The accomplishment he was most well known for was to relegalize the playing of Bingo for charitable purposes in the state of Illinois in 1971. This game had been outlawed as form of illegal gambling. Church and veterans' organizations had used the game as a source of revenue. His partner in this campaign was Republican W.J. ""Bingo Bill"" Murphy.

He was a member of the Knights of Columbus, LaSalle General Assembly, Moose, Eagles, Kiwanis, Lions, Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union and Chamber of Commerce. His hobbies were fishing, hunting and golfing. He lived above a tavern he and his wife owned at 36th Street and Damen Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. He briefly marketed a brand of whiskey called ""Bingo Bourbon"" to commemorate the passage of the Bingo law. He was one of the organizers of ""The Donkey Saurkraut Club"". He was also an insurance and real estate broker. He would entertain children by making bunny rabbits out of a handkerchief and a could make a variety of bird calls from a blade of grass.

Fary was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-fourth Congress by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative John Kluczynski and reelected to the three succeeding Congresses (July 8, 1975 – January 3, 1983). He served on the Aviation Subcommittee and was instrumental in rebuilding Midway Airport. He was one of several congressmen who pursued federal funding for a flood control plan for the South Side called the Little Calumet Watershed Plan, which Congress eventually approved. He was defeated in the 1982 Democratic primary by Chicago Alderman Bill Lipinski.  He was named 1978 National Citizen of the year by a Polish newspaper in Buffalo, NY. In 1982, a railway bridge on 67th and Cicero in the Southside of Chicago was named in his honor. He died in Chicago, Illinois, June 7, 1984 at Rush Presbyterian St Luke's Hospital. He was interred at Resurrection Cemetery, Justice, Illinois. The funeral procession of nearly 100 cars was escorted to the church by Chicago police. Seven Roman Catholic priests, led by Bishop Alfred Abramowicz, auxiliary bishop of Chicago and pastor of Five Holy Martyrs Church celebrated the requiem mass accompanied by the bishop's choir and violinists from the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. 250 mourners were in attendance.

1997 filmsThe Stouffville Spirit are a Junior ""A"" ice hockey team from Whitchurch–Stouffville, Ontario, Canada. The Stouffville Spirit are members of the Central Canadian Hockey League of the Ontario Hockey Association.

History
From 1970 until 1984, the Stouffville Clippers were members of the Central Junior C Hockey League.  From 1984 until 1995, the team was on a long hiatus.  The Clippers were brought back in 1995, changed their name to the Spirit a season later, and have been members of the OPJHL ever since.
Junior hockey has a long and storied history in Stouffville.

The 1947 Stouffville Red Wings won an OHA championship. Junior hockey was popular in Stouffville through the 1960s, right into the early 1980s.

The Spirit was founded in 1995. George Stavro, who was granted the franchise by the Ontario Hockey Association, was the team's first coach and general manager. Junior hockey hadn't been played in Stouffville since 1984, when the OHA's junior C Stouffville Clippers folded.

But Stavro didn't last a full season in the Provincial Junior A Hockey League.

In mid-season, he sold the franchise to Stouffville businessman Ed Hakonson, who had tried to obtain a junior A franchise for Stouffville earlier in the '90s. Former Stouffville minor official Wally Crowder was named general manager, and Steve Sedore of Georgina head coach.

The Spirit struggled on and off the ice over the first three seasons. Sedore was replaced as coach by Stouffville minor hockey grad Dan Larmer. Larmer played junior hockey in southern Ontario and college hockey at Mercyhurst in Pennsylvania, before a brief pro career.

A move of home games at the Whitchurch-Stouffville Recreation Complex, from Saturday nights to Thursdays, improved attendance. But the Spirit didn't make the playoffs in its first three seasons.

A new regime took over Spirit hockey operations in 1998. New Spirit general manager Dieter Schmidt had been manager and head coach Brian Perrin was associate coach with the successful Newmarket Hurricanes' organization, before accepting promotions in Stouffville.

The Spirit has made the playoffs ever since. Its regular season record has improved annually.

Players have advanced to college and major junior hockey since Year 1 of the Spirit.

Hakonson sold shares in the hockey club to Stouffville-area resident Zeev Werek and Larry Goldberg in 1999, then sold the rest of the team to Werek and Goldberg a year later. David Laren joined the Spirit in 2002 as an equal partner. Goldberg left the group in 2005.

Schmidt retired as GM after the 2000-2001 season. His replacement is Stouffville native Ken Burrows, who in 10 years with the Spirit has been vice-president of hockey, assistant coach and scout.

A volunteer board of directors oversees the operation of the Spirit.

The Spirit is proud to be affiliated with the Whitchurch-Stouffville Minor Hockey Association and the Uxbridge Bruins Junior C Hockey Club.

35,256,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type4,"Kathleen Edwards (born July 11, 1978) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. Her 2002 debut album, Failer, contained the singles ""Six O'Clock News"" and ""Hockey Skates"". Her next two albums – Back to Me and Asking for Flowers – both made the Billboard 200 list and reached the top 10 of Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. In 2012, Edwards' fourth studio album, Voyageur, became Edwards' first album to crack the top 100 and top 40 in the U.S., peaking at #39 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and #2 in Canada. In 2012, Edwards' song ""A Soft Place To Land"" won the SOCAN Songwriting Prize, an annual competition that honours the best song written and released by 'emerging' songwriters over the past year, as voted by the public. Her musical sound has been compared to Suzanne Vega meets Neil Young.

Early life 
Edwards, the daughter of a diplomat, spent portions of her youth in Korea and Switzerland. Her father is Leonard Edwards, former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. At age 5, Edwards began classical violin studies that continued for the next 12 years. As a teenager she lived overseas, where she spent much of her time listening to her brother's records of Neil Young and Bob Dylan. Her brother also bought her her first record, a Tom Petty album.  After high school she decided not to attend post-secondary education, instead opting to play local clubs to pay the bills.

Music career
In 1999, Edwards recorded a six-song EP entitled Building 55 and pressed 500 copies. By the fall of 2000, she was on tour across Canada managing her own gigs. In 2001, she wrote seven of the ten songs for her 2002 debut release Failer.

Edwards played at SXSW in 2002 and was signed to Rounder Records and MapleMusic shortly after. Failer was released in Canada in the fall of 2002 on MapleMusic Recordings.  In January 2003 Failer was released by Rounder Records in the US and internationally.  Rolling Stone declared her one of year's most promising new acts and Blender said that Failer songs possessed ""an indefinable pull that makes you love the characters they describe, no matter how fucked up they are."" The New York Times praised Edwards as a writer whose songs can ""pare situations down to a few dozen words while they push country-rock towards its primal impulses of thump and twang.""  She made  her television network debut on the Late Show with David Letterman where she performed ""Six O'Clock News.""

In 2005, Edwards released Back to Me, which also garnered considerable critical acclaim, and led to the release of the singles ""Back to Me"" and ""In State"". The track ""Summerlong"" was also featured on the soundtrack of the movie Elizabethtown starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst. 
  

In 2008, Edwards released her third studio album, Asking for Flowers. It was described by the San Francisco Bay Guardian as ""her finest album to date"", and was a shortlisted nominee for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize. In contrast with 2005's Back to Me, on which Edwards relied on her working band, Asking for Flowers predominantly features session musicians.

In fall 2010, Edwards began working on her fourth studio album in Wisconsin. Voyageur was released in January 2012. It includes the single ""Change the Sheets,"" and was co-produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.

She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman on January 17, 2012, singing ""Change the Sheets"" from her new album Voyageur.

In November 2019, Edwards released ""It's Christmastime (Let's Just Survive)"", her first new single since Voyageur, on the Dualtone Records compilation album A Dualtone Christmas.

In May 2020, Edwards released the single ""Options Open"" and announced Total Freedom, her first new album in eight years. The album was released on August 14, 2020.

Musical collaborations
In 2005, Edwards lent her vocals to the duet ""The Plan"", recorded with Matt Mays and El Torpedo for their self-titled album. In 2006, she was nominated for Juno Awards for Songwriter of the Year and Adult Alternative Album of the Year for Back to Me. In 2007, Edwards worked with John Doe, of the punk rock band X, on his solo album A Year in the Wilderness. She sings on three tracks.

In 2008 Edwards sang backup vocals on Bryan Adams' album 11, and supported one of his tours. In 2009, she joined Adams on stage to sing one of Adams' songs, ""Walk on By"".
In 2011 Edwards contributed vocals on Arkells' song ""Agent Zero"", off their second album Michigan Left. ""Soft Place to Land"", one of two songs on Edwards' Voyageur album co-written with The Long Winters frontman John Roderick, won the 2012 SOCAN Echo Songwriting Prize.

She co-wrote the song ""Good Woman"", from Maren Morris's 2019 album Girl.

Personal life
In 2004 Edwards married guitarist and collaborator Colin Cripps.  They divorced in 2011. Edwards was later in a relationship with Justin Vernon, Wisconsin-born singer/songwriter and front-man of the band Bon Iver. Edwards and Vernon separated in 2012.

Edwards stepped back from the music scene in 2014, launching a coffee house in Stittsville called Quitters along with Rick Tremblay (who was her manager when she worked in a downtown Starbucks in the 1990s). She insisted that she is not leaving music but just taking a break, and that the name Quitters is ""kind of tongue-in-cheek"".

As of 2018, Edwards continued to perform sporadically, including a number of new songs. In August 2019, following the suicide of American singer-songwriter Neal Casal, Edwards opened up on Twitter about the struggle with depression that led her to take time away from her music career.

In the International System of Units, the position of the moving object is measured in meters relative to the origin, while the time is measured in seconds. Placing position on the y-axis and time on the x-axis, the slope of the curve is given by:

Here  is the position of the object, and  is the time. Therefore, the slope of the curve gives the change in position divided by the change in time, which is the definition of the average velocity for that interval of time on the graph. If this interval is made to be infinitesimally small, such that  becomes  and  becomes , the result is the instantaneous velocity at time , or the derivative of the position with respect to time.

A similar fact also holds true for the velocity vs. time graph. The slope of a velocity vs. time graph is acceleration, this time, placing velocity on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Again the slope of a line is change in  over change in :

where  is the velocity, and  is the time. This slope therefore defines the average acceleration over the interval, and reducing the interval infinitesimally gives , the instantaneous acceleration at time , or the derivative of the velocity with respect to time (or the second derivative of the position with respect to time). In SI, this slope or derivative is expressed in the units of meters per second per second (, usually termed ""meters per second-squared"").

Since the velocity of the object is the derivative of the position graph, the area under the line in the velocity vs. time graph is the displacement of the object. (Velocity is on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. Multiplying the velocity by the time, the time cancels out, and only displacement remains.)

The same multiplication rule holds true for acceleration vs. time graphs. When acceleration is multiplied

Variable rates of change

The expressions given above apply only when the rate of change is constant or when only the average (mean) rate of change is required. If the velocity or positions change non-linearly over time, such as in the example shown in the figure, then differentiation provides the correct solution. Differentiation reduces the time-spans used above to be extremely small (infinitesimal) and gives a velocity or acceleration at each point on the graph rather than between a start and end point. The derivative forms of the above equations are

Since acceleration differentiates the expression involving position, it can be rewritten as a second derivative with respect to time:

Since, for the purposes of mechanics such as this, integration is the opposite of differentiation, it is also possible to express position as a function of velocity and velocity as a function of acceleration. The process of determining the area under the curve, as described above, can give the displacement and change in velocity over particular time intervals by using definite integrals:

TextDrive was incorporated in California in May 2004 with Allen as chief executive officer and Jason Hoffman as president and chief operating officer. TextDrive was positioned as ""a hosting company run by and for people who love publishing on the web.""

Lifetime hosting crisis at Joyent, relaunch and shutdown of TextDrive

On August 16, 2012, individuals who had provided start-up and development funding to Joyent (and its predecessor, TextDrive) in exchange for lifetime shared hosting accounts with Joyent were informed, via email, that their lifetime hosting accounts would be deleted on October 31, 2012. Depending on the nature of their initial investment, they were offered either one or three free years of hosting on a Joyent SmartMachine, the company's cloud hosting solution, after which they would be moved to a regularly billed account. Customer backlash to the announcement turned out to be fierce.

On August 30, 2012, TextDrive co-founder Dean Allen announced that he was relaunching TextDrive as a separate company which will carry on Joyent's shared hosting business and honor the ""lifetime"" agreements. Allen relaunched TextDrive in late 2012 using Joyent infrastructure. At the time, he was confident he would succeed in building a viable business similar to DreamHost.

On March 3, 2014, Dean Allen announced the shutdown of TextDrive:

As anyone looking for decent support or even useful information over the past few months can attest, the revival of TextDrive has not been a success.

What began in mid-2012 as an exciting challenge fuelled by good intentions and lean resources quickly turned into a cleanup project with almost no resources.

It is disappointing to report that after a year and a half of uphill battles and unimagined setbacks, after several costly efforts to regroup and find another way, options to keep TextDrive growing have run out, and we will cease operations on the 14th of March, 2014.

For those who wish to know, details of what went wrong will be made available once shutdown operations have completed.

Sorry to have let you down.

File hostingThe Mill Branch archaeological site is located in Warren County, Georgia west of Augusta and south of Thomson. It is located in the Brier Creek watershed. A reservoir was deemed necessary to assist in kaolin processing during times of drought. For this project to commence, a permit was needed from the Corps of Engineers, which required a cultural resource impact study to first be done.  J.M. Huber Corporation contracted Southeastern Archaeological Services to do an initial survey of the area in 1988 with additional data recovery in 1990. J.M Huber Corporation determined that two sites surveyed by Southeastern Archaeological Services, specifically 9WR4 and 9WR11, could not be avoided or preserved. Huber no longer owns this property. These two sites were excavated between April 23 and May 31, 1990. The field report, Archaeological Investigations at Mill Branch Sites 9WR4 and 9WR11 Warren County, Georgia, was published in 1995 and compiled by R. Jerald Ledbetter.

9WR4
Site 9WR4 was located on the west bank of Brier Creek with the northern boundary set by Little Brier Creek. The site measured about 1.20 hectares in size.  9WR4 was divided into northern, southern, and southeastern areas due to topography.  
This site was excavated in all three sections using heavy machinery in conjunction with manual spadework. A smooth bucket backhoe was used to excavate a total of eighteen trenches as well as a 20 m x 20 m block and a 25 m x 25 m block. The trenches were then cleaned and smoothed by hand trowel. 
Artifacts emphasizing the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland periods were identified.  Five types of features were found throughout 9WR4: unlined midden pits, rock lined midden pits, rock clusters, post molds, and an early dwelling.

Pit House
A feature described as ""the single most important discovery on 9WR4"" was found in the southern section.   This feature was a Late Archaic midden filled pit house. Charcoal found in the hearth was radiocarbon dated to 1900-1950 B.C.  The distribution of artifacts suggested that the artifacts were accumulated over time, and not used as fill after abandonment of the dwelling.  
This large rectangular feature measured about 5m x 4m x 35 cm and had a volume of about 5650 liters.  There was no evidence of multiple structures present at one time.

9WR11
Site 9WR11 was located to the south of 9WR4 and just across Mill Branch which forms the northern border of the site. The site measured to about 1.20 hectares making this site about the same size as 9WR4, but due to a mature hardwood presence, fewer blocks were excavated.  
This site was surveyed using a systematic series of shovel tests, and then heavy machinery was used to clear four trenches to a maximum depth of 40 cm except for Trench 1 which was dug to a maximum of 1.2 m.   A smooth backhoe was used to create the trenches, and they were all 3 m wide and ranged in length from 9 m - 22.5 m.  Trench 3 was expanded into an excavation block. 
9WR11 was a Late Archaic primary lithic workshop site.   The majority of the artifacts found were lithic. Some pottery was found from later periods suggesting that the site may have been used as a secondary workshop in later periods.

It was built between about 1920 and 1949 by artist Henry Varnum Poor (1887–1970).  It combines elements of rustic Arts and Crafts Movement vernacular with elements of the Modern movement.  Also on the property are a studio dated to 1957; a small half-timbered mill building, 1921; woodshop, ca. 1920–1930; an outdoor kiln from 1957; bridge, ca. 1950; and a terraced garden, 1926.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. About the same time the town of Ramapo purchased the house for $1.3 million with help of a $496,000 grant from the New York State. There were also plans for contribution of furnishings and art from family heir Peter Varnum Poor, but thereafter, collections and restoration efforts barely moved or slid back through at least 2015.

National Register of Historic Places in Rockland County, New YorkThe Story Begins is the debut extended play by South Korean girl group Twice. It was released by JYP Entertainment on October 20, 2015, through KT Music. It features six tracks, including the lead single, ""Like Ooh-Ahh"", which was composed by Black Eyed Pilseung and is a blend of several different genres.

Following the formation of Twice through the survival show Sixteen, which concluded in July 2015, the group made their official debut three months later. The group promoted their debut EP on several South Korean music show programs, with the EP meeting moderate commercial success, peaking at number three on the Gaon Album Chart and selling over 40,000 copies by the end of 2015.

Background and release
On February 11, 2015, JYP Entertainment founder Park Jin-young announced the company's collaboration with Mnet to air Sixteen, a competition survival show that would decide the lineup of an upcoming girl group, the first under JYPE in five years, following the debut of Miss A in 2010. The show, which featured a total of 16 candidates, began airing on May 5.

The show concluded on July 7, with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung being selected as the seven Twice members. Park then made the controversial decision of adding two eliminated contestants: Tzuyu, who was known as the ""audience's pick"" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. It was then announced that the new girl group under JYPE would be making their debut in the later half of 2015.

On October 7, JYPE confirmed that Twice would make their official debut on October 20, with the agency releasing a group teaser image. On October 9, Twice released a group teaser image and confirmed that the lead single for their upcoming album is titled ""Like Ooh-Ahh"". The following day, the group revealed more details about their EP titled The Story Begins, posting a picture of the album's track list revealing six songs in total. On October 12, the group released individual teaser videos featuring Nayeon, Momo, and Mina, which depicted certain notable characteristics or personalities of each member. In each of their respective videos, zombies made an unexpected but short appearance. Later on the same day, individual teaser photos of the three members were uploaded. On October 13, individual teaser photos of Sana, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu were released. The following day, teaser photos for Jeongyeon, Jihyo, and Dahyun were uploaded.

On October 15, the group uploaded two teaser images featuring all the members. On October 16, they uploaded a music video teaser clip revealing a part of their choreography for ""Like Ooh-Aah"". The members were depicted to be dancing in the middle of a zombie horde. On October 17, Twice uploaded an album highlight medley featuring audio instrumental snippets for all tracks in the EP. A day before the release of their album, the group held a live countdown broadcast on V Live.

The Story Begins and its title track ""Like Ooh-Ahh"" was officially released on October 20.

Composition 
The Story Begins is an EP consisting of six tracks. The title track ""Like Ooh-Ahh"" is produced by Black Eyed Pilseung, who had previously worked with other artists under JYP Entertainment including Miss A and Got7. The song was sonically described as a color pop track which incorporates various genres such as hip hop, R&B, and rock. The second track ""Do It Again"" was written by Park Jin-young, lyrically describing the excitement one feels after receiving a confession of love from another person, and was previously performed by Twice in Sixteen. ""Going Crazy"" is another song that was first performed by the group during Sixteen, and lyrically talks about uncontrollable feelings due to infatuation. The song ""Truth"" is classified as a song incorporating pop dance, punk, and ballad. ""Candy Boy"" is described to be a love song, with the song's lyrics depicting how a person can meet their loved one even in dreams. The album's closing track ""Like a Fool"" is an acoustic song that tells about a girl's heartache after being unable to confess to their romantic interest.

Promotion

On the same day as the release of The Story Begins, Twice held a live showcase at the AX-Korea in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, wherein they performed ""Like Ooh-Ahh"" alongside the dance tracks ""Going Crazy"" and ""Do It Again.""

Twice promoted their album by appearing and performing on several South Korean music programs. The group made their first-ever music show appearance on M Countdown on October 22, performing ""Like Ooh-Aah"" and ""Do It Again"". This was followed by performances on KBS2's Music Bank on October 23, MBC's Show! Music Core on October 24, and on SBS' Inkigayo on October 25, among other performance dates. The group also made their appearance on the SBS Gayo Daejeon 2015 held on December 27, performing the album's title track.

On January 22, 2016, Twice performed ""Like Ooh-Aah"" alongside a cover of Miss A's ""Bad Girl Good Girl"" and Wonder Girls' ""So Hot"" on You Hee-Yeol's Sketchbook. On April 24, the group performed at the KCON Japan 2016 in a special broadcast done by M Countdown.

Commercial performance
The Story Begins debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart for the week ending October 24, 2015 and peaked at number three two weeks later. By the end of October, the EP sold a total of 17,100 physical copies. At the end of 2015, the album reached 49,904 copies sold.

72,265,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type0,"The Calhoun–Ives Historic District, or more formally the Calhoun Street–Ives Road Historic District, is a locally and nationally designated rural agricultural historic district in the town of Washington, Connecticut.  It is located a mile north of the village of Washington Depot, Connecticut.  It runs along Calhoun Street and Ives Road. It is characterized by modestly scaled 18th and 19th century farmhouses, together with accompanying agricultural outbuildings, farm fields, and fruit orchards, set along roads lined by stone walls. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

Description and history
The Calhoun-Ives area of northwestern Washington was first settled in the 1730s, when it was part of the towns of Woodbury and Kent.  The earliest settlers, members of the Calhoun, Ives, and Averill families, purchased land from Native Americans.  At first, the local farmers engaged in subsistence farming, but by the mid-19th century a trend toward market-driven dairy farming took hold, and is reflected in the changed layouts and outbuildings of the district's farm properties.

The historic district encompasses virtually all of the properties fronting in Calhoun Street and Ives Road.  Including the agricultural fields, the district is about  in size, including a land area extending to Baldwin Hill Road in the south, Kielwasser Road in the north, and in part to Bee Brook Road in the east.  The oldest house, built by James Calhoun c. 1765, is at 156 Calhoun Street.  There are many examples of 19th-century barns and other farm outbuildings, and several of the house are high-quality examples of Greek Revival architecture.

Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in ConnecticutStand Up and Cheer! is a 1934 American Pre-Code musical film directed by Hamilton MacFadden. The screenplay by Lew Brown and Ralph Spence was based upon a story idea by Will Rogers and Philip Klein. The film is about efforts undertaken during the Great Depression to boost the morale of the country. It is essentially a vehicle for a string of vaudeville acts and a few musical numbers. The film is best known for providing the first big breakthrough role for legendary child actress Shirley Temple. A little known bit player before the film, by the end of the year, she appeared in 10 movies, including 4 starring roles in major feature-length films.

Plot
The President of the United States decides that the true cause of the Great Depression (raging when the film was released) is a loss of ""optimism"" as a result of a plot by financiers and bankers who are getting rich from the Depression. The President then appoints Lawrence Cromwell as secretary for the newly created Department of Amusement. Cromwell creates an army of entertainers and sends them out across the country. Much of the action centers around Cromwell auditioning acts in his office (with interruptions from janitor ""George Bernard Shaw"", played by Stepin Fetchit). At the end, as a musical production number breaks forth, Cromwell looks out of his office window and sees the Depression literally, instantaneously lift.

Production
During production, the film was known as ""Fox Follies"". Perhaps the most memorable scene in the movie was the song and dance number by James Dunn and Shirley Temple titled ""Baby Take a Bow"". Temple, who was signed to a $150/week contract initially guaranteed for just two weeks while the film was in full production, did not have enough time to learn the dance routine for the film and instead used a routine she learned from Meglin's. Dunn then learned the routine from her. In recording the sound track for the song, her voice accidentally cracked on the last note, but the producers actually liked it and kept it in. Before filming the dance routine, she slipped and fell while walking in, cutting her head. To remedy this, her mother covered the cut with a spit curl. As filming of the dance number started, Temple's potential quickly became apparent. By the time she was finished, she was brought straight into Fox Film offices and had her contract extended to a year with a seven-year option. The number became so popular that it would serve as the title to her next film, Baby Take a Bow, also starring Dunn.

Reception

Critical reception
Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote that the film ""often comes close to a conception of what a modern Gilbert and Sullivan opus might be. It is true that there are several intrusive numbers which have little to do with the bright pivotal idea, but they have the virtue of being good entertainment."" John Mosher of The New Yorker reviewed it as mediocre, writing it had ""a few good numbers and a lot of very dreary libretto work."" Film Daily reported ""Despite a weakness in construction that has left it with a few air pockets, this musical jamboree has several highlights that will suffice to satisfy the patrons and make them pass the word around."" It added that Shirley Temple ""just about steals the show and leaves the customers hungry for more of her."" ""Richly satiric, the story introduces hilarious types and presents a delightfully mad picture of Washington"", wrote the New York Daily Mirror. The New York Herald Tribune wrote that it was ""successful neither as musical comedy nor hilarious fantasy, but it must be granted certain pleasant features. Amazingly enough, one of them is a child actress."" The New York Daily News wrote that although it ""was designed to wipe away our fears and blues over these hard times by insisting that the depression is over, I'm afraid it is going to have just the opposite effect. Little Shirley Temple earned the only burst of spontaneous applause.""

The film was given a strong endorsement by Variety, especially the work of ""newcomer"" Shirley Temple, whom they cited as the film's ""unofficial star."" Although modern scholars often point to the film as an example of typical Great Depression entertainment, Variety expressed reservations about its theme. ""This musical is a hodge-podge principally handicapped by a national depression premise. Americans now like to think of themselves in the light of being on the upturn and having rounded that long-awaited corner, so Cheer'''s plot motivation is basically questionable [and] open to debate.""

Accolades
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers – Nominated

Releases
The film premiered April 19, 1934 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

The film was a box office disappointment for Fox.

Eleven minutes of footage were deleted for modern home video release, most of it racial in nature. In 2009, the film was available on both videocassette and DVD in the original black-and-white version and a computer-colorized version of the original.  Some versions included theatrical trailers and other special features.

Merchandise
The polka-dot dress worn by Shirley Temple in her song and dance number with Dunn served as the model of the dress used on the first Shirley Temple dolls made by toy manufacturer Ideal in 1934. In 1958, Temple's television show, Shirley Temple's Storybook went into production. At the time, she persuaded various manufacturers to release ancillary merchandise including the Baby Take a Bow'' polka-dot dress (Edwards 233).

The duo comprised Dorothy ""Dottie"" Moore (born 1959, Norristown, Pennsylvania) and Keith Bolling (born 1957, Frankford, Pennsylvania).  Moore, then aged 12, was discovered by record producer and songwriter Jesse James when he was asked to speak to local children at her school.  She sang and danced at the event, and James later got agreement from her mother to form a duo around her.  Keith Bolling was the son of Sam Cooke and a member of Frankford High School's Ambassadors of Song, and under James' direction a duo was formed.  ""Chee-Chee"" (Moore) and ""Peppy"" (Bolling) took their performing names from those of their pet dogs.

Chee-Chee and Peppy's first single, ""I Know I'm In Love"", written, arranged and produced by James and released by Buddah Records, reached #12 on the Billboard R&B chart and #49 on the pop chart in spring 1971, and was followed by ""Never Never Never"", which reached #46 on the R&B chart.  The duo's later recordings were less successful, but they issued an LP, Chee Chee & Peppy, in 1972.  They also appeared on TV shows including American Bandstand, and toured with Linda Jones, opening for Ray Charles, James Brown, Gladys Knight and others.

The original pair disbanded in the early 1970s, but in 1981 James produced a second album by Chee Chee and Peppy, Super You, which again featured Moore as Chee-Chee but a different singer, Charles Gamble, as Peppy.  Dottie Moore-Thomas later became a member of the Word of Deliverance Mass Choir led by Bishop Bobby Hilton in Forest Park, Ohio.

The season featured 24 competing teams from 13 different countries.

The competition began on October 24, 2006, at the Olympic Pavilion in Badalona, Spain, with Panathinaikos winning 82-79 against DKV Joventut. The final of the competition was held on May 6, 2007, in the Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece, the home court of Panathinaikos, with Panathinaikos defeating the defending champions, CSKA Moscow, by a score of 93-91.

Teams 
As announced on the official Euroleague site.

Regular season 
The first phase was a regular season, in which the competing teams were drawn into three groups, each containing eight teams. Each team played every other team in its group at home and away, resulting in 14 games for each team in the first stage. The top 5 teams in each group and the best sixth-placed team advanced to the next round. The complete list of tiebreakers was provided in the lead-in to the Regular Season results.

If one or more clubs were level on won-lost record, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:
 Head-to-head record in matches between the tied clubs
 Overall point difference in games between the tied clubs
 Overall point difference in all group matches (first tiebreaker if tied clubs were not in the same group)
 Points scored in all group matches
 Sum of quotients of points scored and points allowed in each group match

Group C

Top 16 
The surviving teams were divided into four groups of four teams each, and again a round robin system was adopted, resulting in 6 games each, with the two top teams advancing to the quarterfinals. Tiebreakers were identical to those used in the Regular Season.

The draw was held February 5, at 13:00 CET (1200 UTC) in Barcelona, in accordance with Euroleague rules.

The teams were placed into four pools, as follows:

Level 1: The three group winners, plus the top-ranked second-place team
 CSKA Moscow, Tau Cerámica, Panathinaikos, Dynamo Moscow
Level 2: The remaining second-place teams, plus the top two third-place teams
 Winterthur FC Barcelona, Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv, Olympiacos, Benetton Treviso
Level 3: The remaining third-place team, plus the three fourth-place teams
 DKV Joventut, Efes Pilsen, Pau-Orthez, Unicaja
Level 4: The fifth-place teams, plus the top ranked sixth-place team
 Lottomatica Roma, Aris TT Bank, Prokom Trefl Sopot, Partizan

Each Top 16 group included one team from each pool. The draw was conducted under the following restrictions:
 No more than two teams from the same Regular Season group could be placed in the same Top 16 group.
 No more than two teams from the same country could be placed in the same Top 16 group.
 If there is a conflict between these two restrictions, (1) would receive priority.

Another draw was held to determine the order of fixtures. In the case of two teams from the same city in the Top 16 (CSKA Moscow and Dynamo Moscow, Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, FC Barcelona and Joventut Badalona) they were scheduled so that every week only one team would be at home.

Quarterfinals 

Each quarterfinal was a best-of-three series between a first-place team in the Top 16 and a second-place team from a different group, with the first-place team receiving home advantage. Quarterfinals were played on April 3 and 5, 2007, with third games to be played April 12 if necessary.

In 2005, the Spiritual Organisation of Muslims in Moldova headed by Talgat Masaev was denied registration despite the appeal of the Mission to Moldova of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

In March 2011, the Islamic League of Moldova (Liga Islamică din Moldova), an NGO representing Moldova's Muslims, was registered by the Moldovan Justice Ministry as the first legally recognized Muslim association in Moldova. It had applied for registration in 2008. 

The Moldovan Orthodox Church opposed the recognition of Islam and joined protests with conservative groups.

As of 2011, officially there were just 2,000 Muslims in Moldova. But the Islamic League of Moldova  head Sergiu Sochirca said the number was closer to 17,000, though not all of them were registered as Muslims due to suppression of Islam in the past.

Demographics
There are 2,009 Muslims living in Moldova according to the 2014 Moldovan census, an increase from the 1,667 Muslims that lived in Moldova according to the 2004 Moldovan census.  Most of the Muslims live in Chișinău (985 people), followed by Gagauzia (176 people), Bălți (76 people), Anenii Noi (68 people) and Cahul (54 people).

MoldovaTrương Minh Giảng (, 1792 – 1841) was a general and official of Vietnam during the Nguyễn dynasty.

Early life
Trương-Minh Giảng was born in Gia Định (modern Ho Chi Minh City). He came from an important aristocratic family of southern Vietnam, the Trương-Minh family from which also comes the scholar Trương Minh Ký (1855-1900). His father, Trương-Minh Thành was the minister of ceremony (Lễ bộ Thượng thư) of Emperor Gia Long. Giảng passed the triennal exam with the grade of hương cống in 1819. He became a military mandarin in the service of Emperor Minh-Mang and was appointed major general.

Career
A rebellion was launched by Lê Văn Khôi in Gia Định in 1833. This was an important revolt in southern Vietnam, Giảng was sent to put down the rebellion together with Tống Phúc Lương, Nguyễn Xuân, Phan Văn Thúy and Trần Văn Năng.

Two Siamese generals, Bodindecha and Phra Klang, led troops to attack the Vietnamese provinces of Hà Tiên and An Giang and Vietnamese imperial forces in Laos and Cambodia. Giảng and his 10,000 soldiers defeated the Siamese army in Cambodia, and installed Ang Chan II as a client king of Cambodia. Giảng was appointed Governor-General of Cambodia and stayed in Phnom Penh to watch the king.

In 1835 Ang Chan II died without heir. Giảng installed Ang Mey as a client queen. He ordered all Cambodian women to wear Vietnamese-style pyjamas instead of the khmer sampot (similar to the sarong), grow their hair long in Vietnamese style. Phnom Penh was renamed with a Vietnamese name: Trấn Tây Thành (鎮西城), or ""Western Commandery"". Many Wats (temples) were destroyed during this period, and numerous ethnic Vietnamese came to Cambodia.

Cambodia became a part of Vietnam in 1841, and Ang Mey was deposed and exiled to Gia Định. Many Cambodian were infuriated, and revolted against the Vietnamese rule. Seizing the opportunity, Siam invaded Cambodia in an attempt to install Ang Duong on the throne as their own puppet, triggering the Siamese–Vietnamese War (1841–45). Giảng tried to resist but failed. The new emperor Thiệu Trị suddenly decided to withdraw all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia following the advice of Tạ Quang Cự.

Giảng died suddenly on his way back to Huế. Sources stated that he committed suicide by taking poison together with other two senior generals to avoid punishment from the emperor.

Competitors at the 2001 Mediterranean GamesHMS Charlotte was a mercantile schooner that Royal Navy hired or chartered in 1796 (or earlier), purchased in 1797 and commissioned in 1798. In her brief military career in the Caribbean she captured two small enemy privateers before she herself fell prey to a French privateer. The British recaptured her a little more than a year later but then broke her up in 1799 rather than recommissioning her.

Cruising
The Royal Navy armed Charlotte with eight 6-pounder guns and gave her a crew of 60 men. There are no records of any of her dimensions. She was commissioned under Lieutenant John Williams. A letter from Commander James Athol Wood of  reporting on the recapture of a vessel on 9 March 1796, states that he put ""The Officers on Board the Charlotte Sloop, Lieutenant Williams..."".

On 29 May 1797 Charlotte captured the French schooner Mort, off Dominica. Mort was armed with four guns and had a crew of 36 men. She had not made any captures since leaving Guadeloupe.

On 9 September Charlotte  captured the Dutch privateer Esle Andeneming, of Surinam. Esle Andeneming was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 38 men. She was provisioned for a three-month cruise and was nineteen days out, not having captured anything, when Charlotte captured her off the Demerary river.

Capture
Lieutenant John Thicknesse replaced Williams. Shortly thereafter, on 16 October 1798 the French 14-gun privateer Enfant Prodigue captured Charlotte off Cap Français or Cape François, Hispaniola. Charlotte suffered one man wounded before she struck her colours. A second, smaller schooner and two large armed launches supported Enfant Prodigue in the attack on Charlotte, which suffered considerable damage. Her main boom topping lift and all the braces had been shot away. One gun had been dismounted and two others disabled by broken breeches, leaving her with only five guns to continue the action. Surrounded by the enemy and unable to manoeuvre, Thicknesse was forced to surrender. Charlottes low casualty rate was a consequence of the French tactic of firing high to disable rigging. The subsequent court-martial honourably acquitted Thicknesse of the loss.

Recapture
The French Navy took her into service as Vengeur. However, on 24 November 1799,  recaptured her and three other armed vessels as well, off Cape Triburon as the four French vessels were becalmed while on their way from Cape François to Jacquemel. Vengeur was armed with eight brass 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 91 men.  shared in the capture.

Fate
The Royal Navy chose to break up Charlotte/Vengeur rather than recommission her.

The Pinewood Centre is run by Wokingham Without Parish Council.

History
Pinewood is known for its dense forest of pine trees. Following clearance of parts of the area in the twentieth century, a number of buildings were erected around the crossroads. The London Open Air Sanatorium for tuberculosis patients was opened in 1901 before becoming the Pinewood Sanatorium and then the Pinewood Hospital. Pine trees were thought to be beneficial for sufferers of the disease. It closed in 1966. In 2011, efforts were underway to turn the remains of the hospital into a museum.

It is organised into a fibronectin III module domain-like fold, comprising only beta strands. Its function is not known, but it may be involved in interaction with the enzyme substrate, chitin. It is separated by a hinge region from the catalytic domain; this hinge region is probably mobile, allowing the N-terminal domain to have different relative positions in solution.

1880s establishments in IowaThe Pittsburgh Line is the Norfolk Southern Railway's primary east–west artery in its Pittsburgh Division and Harrisburg Division across the U.S. state of Pennsylvania and is part of the Keystone Corridor, Amtrak-Norfolk Southern's combined rail corridor.

The Pittsburgh Line spans  between its namesake city of Pittsburgh and the state capital in Harrisburg, crossing the Allegheny Mountains through the Gallitzin Tunnels west of Altoona and the famous Horseshoe Curve in the process. Its east end connects with the railroad's Harrisburg Line to Reading and Philadelphia, and the west end connects to the Fort Wayne Line to Conway, Pennsylvania, and points west in Ohio and Indiana.

The Pittsburgh Line is arguably Norfolk Southern's busiest freight corridor, where 50 to 70 trains traverse the line daily.

History
The Pittsburgh Line was originally owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). It began as two rail lines, the Middle Division Main Line which was part of the PRR Middle Division and the Pittsburgh Division Main Line which was part of the PRR Pittsburgh Division. The Pennsylvania Railroad combined the Middle Division Main Line and the Pittsburgh Division Main Line into one rail line, forming the Pittsburgh Line, though at the time the Pittsburgh Line was not referred to by that name. At the same time the Middle Division and the Pittsburgh Division were also combined.

The Pennsylvania Railroad eventually combined the merged Middle Division/Pittsburgh Division Main Line with their main rail line to Philadelphia, forming the Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now known as the Keystone Corridor). The Main Line served as the PRR's primary route across Pennsylvania, continuing its existence through the Penn Central years and the early years of Conrail.

Conrail broke the PRR Main Line into two rail lines again, reestablishing the Pittsburgh Line and the PRR Philadelphia main line which eventually became known as the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line, now under the ownership of Amtrak. The Pittsburgh Line received its current name in the 1980s under Conrail.

The Pittsburgh Line was passed down to the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999 during the breakup of Conrail between Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation.

Major terminals
The Pittsburgh Line is marked with three major freight terminals at its ends. On its east end, Harrisburg Terminal handles the bulk of the railroad's intermodal traffic, with a handful of intermodal trains originating and terminating there. Across the Susquehanna River in Enola is Norfolk Southern's major freight terminal in the Greater Harrisburg area: Enola Yard, which handles almost all manifest freight traffic that passes through the area. Many of the Pittsburgh Line's manifest freight trains originate or terminate here, with a few continuing south to Baltimore and points east, while others bypass Enola and cross the Rockville Bridge over the Susquehanna to Harrisburg bound for Allentown and points east.

On its west end, the Pittsburgh Line becomes the Fort Wayne Line after crossing the Allegheny River bridge, where trains travel  to reach Conway Yard. Conway is the hub of activity in Western Pennsylvania, where many trains originate and terminate, with many of those trains being the same freight trains that originate and terminate at Enola Yard, respectively. Conway is the hub of operations for Norfolk Southern in the Greater Pittsburgh area, featuring a hump yard and a crew change point for virtually all Pittsburgh and Fort Wayne Line trains.

Routing

From Harrisburg/Enola, the railroad travels northwest following the path of the Susquehanna River parallel to U.S. Route 11/15, passing through the communities of Marysvile, Cove, and Duncannon. At Duncannon, the Pittsburgh Line leaves the Susquehanna and follows the path of the smaller Juniata River, which it will follow for much of its length to Altoona. This segment is unofficially dubbed the ""Middle Division"", after the Pittsburgh Line's predecessor, the Middle Division Main Line which was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) Middle Division. U.S. Route 22 follows the route for much of its length here. Once at Altoona, the railroad arrives at the base of the Allegheny Mountain Front, which it must climb to reach Johnstown and Pittsburgh.

Altoona is the site of the Norfolk Southern (NS)'s Juniata Shops, the largest locomotive repair facility on the NS system. Originally constructed by the PRR in 1850, this large complex of shops is what gave the city of Altoona its worth and structure.

Leaving Altoona, the railroad travels at a 1.76% grade up the east slope of the Alleghenies, negotiating the famous Horseshoe Curve during that climb. Past the curve, the Pittsburgh Line continues to climb a grade of 1.86% to the small town of Gallitzin, where the mainline reaches the top of its climb at  above sea level, the total westward climb from Altoona amounting to . From there, the railroads descends the Alleghenies' west slope to Johnstown, a total distance of about . From Johnstown, the Pittsburgh Line follows the path of the Conemaugh River on both of its banks to Conpit Junction, where the line divides. Westbound and lighter eastbound trains take the again-graded Pittsburgh Line west towards Pittsburgh, while heavier eastbound trains take the Conemaugh Line on an easier routing from Pittsburgh, which continues to follow the Conemaugh River. The Conemaugh Line joins back in with the Pittsburgh Line at CP-PENN in Pittsburgh. The line's westernmost end is at CP-WEST PITT by Pittsburgh's Amtrak station, where it crosses the Allegheny River to form the Fort Wayne Line.

Allegheny Mountains and Horseshoe Curve

Until reaching Altoona, the Pittsburgh Line is a double-track mainline from Duncannon. Once at Altoona, a third track is added for the climb up the Allegheny Mountains. The line goes back to two at Conpit Junction, where the Conemaugh Line remains a single-track route.

On the east slope of the Alleghenies, the tracks traverse remote mountainous terrain at a grade of about 1.8%. Roughly halfway up the westward ascent lies the Horseshoe Curve. Originally constructed by the PRR in 1854, the 220-degree curve was the solution for the railroad to gain enough elevation around a valley to reach the higher land across to continue west. Constructed mainly by immigrants, the curve was built by cutting into the hillside around Kittanning Point and filling in the necessary places for the railroad right-of-way to be laid. Today, the curve functions as a tourist attraction for both railroad enthusiasts and the rest of the public, and is a magnet for drawing visitors from all over the globe. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and boasts a visitors park in the apex of the curve adjacent to the Pittsburgh Line tracks, as well as a visitors center and gift shop.

Past the curve, the Pittsburgh Line continues west to Gallitzin, passing through MG Interlocking a mile west of Horseshoe Curve, whose old PRR interlocking tower is also on the historic register, though off-limits to the public. East of Gallitzin, the railroad passes through Bennington Curve, the site of a PRR passenger wreck in 1947 killing 16 people and injuring over 100. Past Bennington Curve at a railroad timetable station called ""SF"", the three tracks split. Tracks 2 (bi-directional) and 3 (westward) continue on towards Gallitzin at their same ascent, while Track 1 (eastward) diverges up a 2.46% grade known as ""The Slide"", which is a downhill-only track restricting trains to traveling no more than  over its steep grade. Both sets of main tracks pass through tunnels to exit and crest in the town of Gallitzin. Tracks 2 and 3 pass through the new Allegheny Tunnel, while Track 1 passes through the New Portage Tunnel. A third tunnel can be seen; the Gallitzin Tunnel, which used to house Track 3 before the Allegheny Tunnel was heightened and widened to house Tracks 2 and 3 as well as doublestack container traffic on intermodal trains in 1994. Upon its completion in 1995, the Gallitzin Tunnel was officially closed.

Past Gallitzin, the railroad passes through the small town of Cresson, where all of the Pittsburgh Line's tracks come back together. Here is also where a locomotive helper base is located, as well as interchange(s) with the RJ Corman Railroad. Also located in Cresson is the Station Inn, a bed and breakfast run exclusively for railroad enthusiasts, which features a long sheltered porch showing a close and clear view of the Pittsburgh Line tracks.

Past Cresson, the railroad passes down the Alleghenies' west slope, through the towns of Lilly, Cassandra, Portage, Wilmore, Summerhill, South Fork, Mineral Point, Parkhill, and East Conemaugh before reaching Johnstown at the bottom of the mountain. South Fork is the junction of the South Fork Secondary, a coal route used to reach local mines in the area which generates a train or two a day bound for various destinations.

Helpers

Helper locomotives are used by Norfolk Southern to assist heavy trains over mountainous portions of the Pittsburgh Line. Helper crews are mainly based in Altoona and Conemaugh/Johnstown, though some helpers are called as far away as Pittsburgh. For many years, EMD SD40-2 locomotives held down pusher duties in the Altoona Helper Pool until 2009, when newer SD40E locomotives constructed by Juniata began to phase out the older locomotive models. The SD40E's finally filled the ranks of the SD40-2's in the summer of 2010. Both locomotive models are rated at , and are either used in pairs or pairings of pairs. The latter are known as ""4-Bangers"" on the mountain by local railfans. In late 2019, Norfolk Southern began bringing in SD70ACUs to replace the previous SD40E fleet. In April 2020, nearly 50% of Altoona's helpers are SD70ACUs.

Passenger operations

Today, a pair of Amtrak passenger trains is the only passenger service that remains on the Pittsburgh Line. Amtrak's Pennsylvanian trains make the following Pennsylvania station stops on the Pittsburgh Line: Harrisburg, Lewistown, Huntingdon, Tyrone, Altoona, Johnstown, Latrobe, Greensburg, and Pittsburgh.

In May 2013 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agreed to US$3.8 million in funding to subsidize the passenger line.

52,271,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type1,"Janet Lippman Abu-Lughod (August 3, 1928 – December 14, 2013) was an American sociologist who made major contributions to world-systems theory and urban sociology.

Early life
Raised in Newark, New Jersey, she attended Weequahic High School, where she was influenced by the works of Lewis Mumford about urbanization.

Academia

Janet Abu-Lughod held graduate degrees from the University of Chicago and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her teaching career began at the University of Illinois, took her to the American University in Cairo, Smith College, and Northwestern University, where she taught for twenty years and directed several urban studies programmes. In 1950-1952 Abu-Lughod was a director of research for the American Society of Planning Officials, in 1954-1957 – research associate at the University of Pennsylvania, consultant and author for the American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods. In 1987 she accepted a professorship in sociology and historical studies at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, from which she retired as professor emerita in 1998. Upon retirement she held visiting short-term teaching appointments at Bosphorous University in Istanbul and on the International Honors Program at the University of Cairo. She published over a hundred articles and thirteen books dealing with urban sociology, the history and dynamics of the World System, and Middle Eastern cities, including an urban history of Cairo that is still considered one of the classic works on that city: Cairo: 1001 Years of the City Victorious.

In 1976 she was awarded a John Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for Sociology. Abu-Lughod received over a dozen prestigious national government fellowships and grants to research in the areas of demography, urban sociology, urban planning, economic and social development, world systems, and urbanization in the United States, the Middle East and the Third World.

She was especially well-known for her monograph Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350  wherein she argued that a pre-modern world system extending across Eurasia existed in the 13th Century, prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Immanuel Wallerstein. In addition, she argued that the ""rise of the West,"" beginning with the intrusion of armed Portuguese ships into the relatively peaceful trade networks of the Indian Ocean in the 16th century, was not a result of features internal to Europe, but was made possible by a collapse in the previous world system.

Abu-Lughod in her works approaches the social and economic development of global cities with the commitment to seeing and acting on possibilities for constructive social change. The span of her works goes from micro-level studies of territoriality and social change, to the analysis of the diffusion of global cities in the Western and Arab world, to historical studies of medieval cities.

At the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario he won the six mile race with a time of 30:49.6 mins, despite stopping over the finish line after what he thought was the last lap and being told that there was a lap to go. The official had inadvertently turned over two discs instead of one. He beat Ernie Harper from England. In the three mile race (equivalent to 5000 meters) he did not finish.

At the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles he finished fourth in both the 5000 metre event and the 10000 metre competition.

He did not compete in the national championships in 1935 and 1936 as he was working as a stonemason and could not spend the necessary time training, but competed against two Japanese runners who were visiting New Zealand in 1937. Like Malcolm Champion before him he was then for some years Custodian at Auckland's Tepid Baths.

Railway lines in Greece
Metre gauge railways in GreeceKarate was first introduced to American service men after World War II by Japanese and Okinawan karate masters.

Many of these US servicemen took their newfound skills to the United States and established their own dojos. Many Japanese karate instructors were also sent to popularize the martial art in the United States. Robert Trias was the first American to open a karate dojo in the United States.

Joey Rhodes was one of the first karate instructors to transform point kumite (sparring) into full contact United States karate. As the captain of the Eastern Illinois University karate team, Rhodes transformed karate into a popular activity through his numerous invitational open style tournaments, clinics, and camps. Rhodes is the founder of Rhodes Karate Schools and started his training in 1968 with the Japan Karate Association.

History
In 1946 Robert Trias, a returning U.S. Navy veteran, began teaching private lessons in Phoenix, Arizona. Other early teachers of karate in America were Ed Parker (a native Hawaiian and Coast Guard veteran who earned a black belt in 1953), George Mattson (who began studying while stationed in Okinawa in 1956), and Peter Urban (a Navy veteran who started training while stationed in Yokosuka in 1954).

Prior to 1946, most karate teachers outside Japan were in the Territory of Hawaii (not yet a state). Many of those teachers taught Kempo, to Asians and locals only — one such teacher was James Mitose. It was through Mitose that one style of Kempo (Kosho Shorei Ryu) was introduced to the world through William Chow, one of his black belts, who then went on to modify it and train Adriano Emperado, Ed Parker, Ralph Castro, and a host of other future grandmasters, some of whom brought the modified art to the U.S.

In the 1950s and early 60s several other Asian karate teachers began arriving in America to seek their fortunes, and to aid in the popularization of the art. They included Hidetaka Nishiyama, Teruyuki Okazaki, Takayuki Mikami, Tsutomu Ohshima, Richard Kim, Takayuki Kubota  and Kazumi Tabata. Several Koreans also came to America in those days to introduce the Korean version of the martial arts (not yet known by the term taekwondo). They included Jhoon Rhee, Henry Cho, Kim Soo, and Jack Hwang.

In spite of the presence of these Asian instructors, karate was primarily spread in the early days by American-born teachers. They included Trias (called the ""Father of American Karate""), Don Nagle, Parker, Mattson, and Urban, plus pioneers like Harold Long, Steve Armstrong, Allen Steen, Ernest Lieb, Pat Burleson, Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis.

The 1960s saw tremendous growth in karate's popularity in the United States. By the 1970s there were even professional karate tournaments, a precursor to full contact karate and kickboxing.

USA National Karate-do Federation
The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was the official organization responsible for the running of all amateur sports in the United States, established in 1888.  The AAU was officially charged with the organization and operation of many sports in the US. During this time, karate was one of the committees in the organization and was not an independent governing body.

The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 enabled the governance of sports in the US by organizations other than the AAU. This act required each sport to set up its own National Governing Body (NGB). Each of these governing bodies would be part of the United States Olympic Committee, but would not be run by the Committee. Thus, the USA National Karate-do Federation was born in 1996.

Founders of American Karate systems
No individual can truly claim to be the founder of ""American Karate"" because it is an eclectic mix of systems and styles. Many instructors have taken what they considered to be the best of different systems to devise a curriculum that worked for them and their students. Some individuals who have claimed to be founders of their own systems of ""American Karate"" are listed here, some of whom have claimed 10th degree or higher black belt ranks for themselves. In Asian culture, most 10th degree black belts (typically represented by a Red Belt) were awarded only upon the death of the Grandmaster by his successor.

Tsutomu Ohshima, after being taught by Gichin Funakoshi, traveled to America and brought Shotokan Karate, as well as creating the Caltech Karate Club, the first American university karate club, in 1957. Master Ohshima is a 5th degree black belt, the highest rank in Shotokan Karate of America. The reason being when Master Funakoshi received his belt as a 5th degree and not caring for rank, Master Ohshima didn't want to go higher than his master, setting the limit at five levels of black belt rank.

Allen R. Steen is a 10th degree black belt who earned his 1st degree in 1961, in Tae Kwon Do from Jhoon Rhee. Steen opened the first karate school in Texas in 1962 and became known as the ""Father of Texas Blood and Guts Karate."" He also gained fame for defeating Chuck Norris and Joe Lewis in a single evening to win Ed Parker's Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1966.

Joe Lewis was often called the ""Muhammad Ali"" of American sport karate. He amassed many firsts including the first World Professional Karate Champion and the first U.S. Heavyweight Champion. He began his martial studies while a 20-year-old U.S. Marine stationed in Okinawa in 1964. He earned a black belt in a record 18 months and due to his outstanding tournament career was named the ""greatest karate fighter of all time"" by his peers in a Black Belt Magazine survey. Lewis died in 2012.

Joey Rhodes is a fifth degree Black Belt (following Master Ohshima’s rank philosophy) recognized as an innovative pioneer in the USA collegiate Karate community for introducing full contact Karate. His United States style blended Japan and Korean techniques, weapons training, and Tameshiwari, (breaking - Rhodes felt physical and psychological confidence were instilled in his upper ranking students because of this test and trial) along with adherence to Gichin Funakoshi twenty precepts, brought unity between many practitioners and schools. Many fellow law enforcement officers adopted Rhodes effective self defense and Tonfa  techniques in the United States. Rhodes retired from martial arts to become an ordained minister.

J. Pat Burleson is a 10th-degree black belt. He received his 1st degree black belt in 1963 in Tae Kwon Do by Allen Steen. Burleson was Allen Steen's first black belt student. Steen, in turn, was Jhoon Rhee's first black belt student in America in 1962. Burleson based his system on Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do, and Wado-Ryu. His website says he is one of the founders of American Karate and his claims have been based on his legitimacy of winning the first National Karate Championships in 1964 in Washington D.C.

Jim R. Harrison is a 9th-degree black belt. He received his 1st degree black belt in Judo and Jujitsu in 1962, Tang Soo Do in 1963, Shorin-Ryu Karate in 1964, having trained under Bob Kurth, Kim Soo Wong and Jim Wax. In 1964 he opened his Bushidokan dojo in Kansas City where he competed, trained several regional and national champions, and hosted major tournaments.

Ernest Lieb was a 10th degree black belt. He received his 1st degree black belt in 1958. Mr. Lieb based his system on Chi Do Kwan, Karate, Judo, Jiu Jitsu, and Aikido. In 1964 Lieb was one of the first teachers to put the word ""American"" in front of karate.

Edmund K. Parker, Sr. was the founder of American Kenpo Karate. He received his black belt in 1953 from William Chow. Parker based his system on Chow's Chinese Kenpo Karate. Parker was one of the first to commercialize karate in America and became known by many as the ""Father of American Kenpo Karate"" because he originated the first ""Americanized"" version of karate.

Keith D. Yates is a 10th degree black belt. He received his 1st degree black belt in 1968 in Tae Kwon Do by Allen Steen. Yates was Allen Steen's youngest black belt student at the time. After a successful tournament career, Yates went on to become a respected teacher and author. He has served on the editorial boards of most of the major martial arts publications and has authored or co-authored 13 books. He also sits on the governing boards of several international martial arts organizations.

John Worley is a 10th degree black belt. He received his 1st degree black belt in 1967 in Karate under the tutelage of Charles Loven, and Texas karate legend Master Instructor J. Pat Burleson. Worley also studied with Jhoon Rhee and was one of the top instructors in the Jhoon Rhee Institute in Washington, D.C., before leaving to found the National Karate system of schools in Minnesota in 1973. Along with co-founder and fellow 10th degree black belt Larry Carnahan, Worley has grown the National Karate schools into one of the most successful sport and Americanized karate systems in North America. In 1977, Worley and Carnahan also founded the Diamond Nationals Karate Championships.

Robert Trias is considered by many to be the father of American karate.

International competition

America is not traditionally considered a ""world power"" in Sport Karate, and its record in Karate World Championships is poor for a country its size and wealth.

Karate World Championships

Reception
Following the inclusion of judo at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, there was growing mainstream Western interest in Japanese martial arts, particularly karate, during the 1960s. By the 1970s, martial arts films (especially kung fu films and Bruce Lee flicks from Hong Kong) had formed a mainstream genre and launched the ""kung fu craze"" which propelled karate and other Asian martial arts into mass popularity. However, mainstream Western audiences at the time generally did not distinguish between different Asian martial arts such as karate, kung fu and tae kwon do.

American Karate experienced an explosion of popularity in the 1970s and 1980s thanks to such movies as The Karate Kid. American Karate is still popular since the 1990s and can hold its own with other martial arts like Taekwondo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and MMA because today it offers many of these same techniques.

In some case as with all arts one of the major criticism of martial arts teaching in the United States, is the common practice in American of teaching primarily for profit, at the expense of good quality self-defense instruction. These are often mocked as McDojos. This is not true in all cases.

It was part of the West Indies squadron and served transporting U.S. sailors, marines and supplies to the pirate infested waters of the Caribbean and was used to search out and attack pirate ships and pirate strongholds.

Acquisition and commissioning
In 1822, the U.S. Navy purchased Terrier at Baltimore, Maryland, for service in Commodore David Porter's (1780–1843) ""Mosquito Fleet"" in conjunction with the campaign to suppress pirates in the West Indies. Outfitted at Norfolk, Virginia, during the latter part of 1822, she was commissioned sometime early in 1823 as USS Terrier with Lieutenant Robert M. Rose in command.

Operational career
Terrier departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the other ships of Porter's squadron on 15 February 1823. The ships reached St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies on 3 March 1823 and began patrolling the coast of Puerto Rico the next day.

Terrier and the seven other shallow-draft schooners acquired at Baltimore were ideally suited to the work of exploring the coastal shallows and shoal waters of the Caribbean where the pirates were based. For the next two years, Terrier operated out of the depot Porter established at what is now Key West, Florida, and remained almost continually on station even during the two outbreaks of yellow fever – in the autumn of 1823 and the summer of 1824 – which sent the majority of the squadron's ships north to healthier latitudes. Terriers area of concentration was the northern coasts of Cuba and Puerto Rico, where havens for the pirates abounded and the authority of the Spanish Empire – weakened by the Spanish struggle against Spains former colonies in Central America and South America – proved almost non-existent.

Undoubtedly, Terrier participated in many of the small expeditions and skirmishes of the squadron, but there is only one documented instance of her capturing a prize. That event occurred early in 1824, when she succeeded in retaking a French ship which had been seized by pirates. Unfortunately, the pirate crew escaped ashore to Spanish territory, a refuge into which Americans could not legally pursue them. Terrier operated in the West Indies until 1825.

Disposal
In 1825, a slackening in seaborne piracy enabled the U.S. Navy to begin disposing of its special-purpose, shallow-draft ships on the West Indies station. Terrier was one of the ships sold – presumably at auction – during 1825.

Saudi Professional League playersThe Dobermann, (; ) or Doberman Pinscher in the United States and Canada, is a medium-large breed of domestic dog that was originally developed around 1890 by Louis Dobermann, a tax collector from Germany.  The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, these procedures are now illegal and it is often considered cruel and unnecessary. Dobermans have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.

Dobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and properly trained, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.

Appearance 
World breed standards are published by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.
It should also appear elegant and noble.

The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males typically have a muscular and intimidating appearance. Females are usually thinner, but should not be spindly.
The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard differs from the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards, with the latter being an often larger and heavier dog. This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.

Size and proportions 
Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as  at the withers; The Kennel Club in the UK quotes  as being ideal. The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is , with  being ideal. The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.

The standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility. The ideal weight of male dogs is described as  and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be .

Color 
Two different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for black (B) and one for color dilution (D). There are nine possible combinations of these alleles, which can result in four different color phenotypes: black, blue, red, and fawn (Isabella). The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one dominant allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as black, black and rust, or black and tan. The red, red rust, or brown coloration occurs when the black gene has two recessive alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The blue Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The fawn coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.

Expression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called Color Dilution Alopecia, a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.

In 1976, a ""white"" Doberman Pinscher was whelped and was subsequently bred to her son, who was also bred to his litter sisters. This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to ""fix"" the mutation. This severe inbreeding only intensified the production of ""white"" dogs, it also amplified their health problems. White Dobermans are not recognized within professional breeders and continue to be reproduced by unethical breeders marketing them as rare in order to charge more for an animal that would never win a show competition. The white colored Doberman is prone to suffer long term medical conditions ranging from: poor hearing or complete deafness, poor vision or complete blindness, behavioral/temperament issues, cancers (predominately skin cancer), amongst others. White/Albino Dobermanns are actually a cream color with white markings, blue eyes, and pink nose. Although this is consistent with albinism, the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown. The animals are commonly known as tyrosinase-positive albinoids, lacking melanin in oculocutaneous structures. This condition is caused by a partial deletion in the SLC45A2 gene.

Tail 
The Dobermann's natural tail is fairly long, but individual dogs often have a short tail as a result of docking, a procedure in which the majority of the tail is surgically removed shortly after birth.

The practice of docking has been around for centuries and is older than the Dobermann as a breed. The historical reason for docking is to ensure that the tail does not get in the way of the dog's work. However, docking has always been controversial. Docking and cropping (see below) have been written out of the Breed Standard by FCI and IDC, and dogs born after 2016 will not be allowed to participate in FCI or IDC shows without a full tail and natural ears. This is mirrored in most EU and Commonwealth countries. In the UK, dogs with docked tails have been banned from show for a number of years and the practice is now illegal for native born dogs. Veterinary Certificates are required as proof to avoid prosecution on imported animals. It has also been made illegal in many other European countries, as well as Australia. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia, and Japan (as well as a number of other countries with Dobermann populations), where it remains legal.

Ears 
Dobermanns often have their ears cropped, a procedure that is thought to be done for functionality for both the traditional guard duty and effective sound localization. According to the Doberman Pinscher Club of America, ears are ""normally cropped and carried erect"". Like tail docking, ear cropping is illegal in many countries and has never been legal in some Commonwealth countries.

Intelligence 

Canine intelligence is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties involved in a wide range of mental tasks, such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. The Doberman Pinscher has been ranked amongst the most intelligent dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations. Psychologist Stanley Coren ranks the Dobermann as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of obedience command training, based on the selective surveys answered by experienced trainers (as documented in his book The Intelligence of Dogs). Additionally, in two studies, Hart and Hart (1985) ranked the Doberman Pinscher first in the same category, and Tortora (1980) gave the Dobermann the highest rank in general trainability. Although methods of evaluation differ, studies have consistently shown that the Doberman Pinscher, along with the Border Collie, Standard Poodle, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, and Rottweiler, are the most trainable breeds of dog.

Aggression 
Although they are considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive. As a personal protection dog, the Dobermann was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, fearless, and willing to defend its owner from attackers (especially from other guard dogs), but sufficiently obedient and restrained to do so only on command. These traits served the dog well in its role as a personal defense dog, police dog, or war dog, but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient.

They can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the most likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.

There is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders. Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits. Although many contemporary Doberman Pinschers in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard.

The personality of the Doberman Pinscher is known to be unique. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined. Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine personality or temperament by using statistical techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability. Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.

In addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs, and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers, Husky-type dogs, wolf-dog hybrids and Alaskan Malamutes. According to this Center for Disease Control and Prevention study, one of the most important factors contributing to dog bites is the level of responsibility exercised by dog owners.

Health
The Dobermann's lifespan is about 10–13 years on average. The breed is prone to a number of health concerns. Common serious health problems include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),
 cervical vertebral instability (CVI), von Willebrand's disease (a bleeding disorder for which genetic testing has been available since 2000), and prostatic disease. Less serious common health concerns include hypothyroidism and hip dysplasia. Canine compulsive disorder is also common. Studies have shown that the Doberman Pinscher suffers from prostatic diseases (such as bacterial prostatiti, prostatic cysts, prostatic adenocarcinoma, and benign hyperplasia), more than any other breed. 
 
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in Dobermanns. This disease affects the breed more than any other. Nearly 40% of DCM diagnoses are for Dobermann Pinschers, followed by German Shepherds at 13%. More recent studies based on European dogs, however, has indicated that DCM affected rates are much higher for this population than their American relatives: around 58% of European Dobermanns will develop DCM within their lifetime. Research has shown that the breed is affected by an attenuated wavy fiber type of DCM that affects many other breeds, as well as an additional fatty infiltration-degenerative type that appears to be specific to Dobermann Pinscher and Boxer breeds.
This serious disease is likely to be fatal in most Dobermanns affected.

Roughly a quarter of Dobermann Pinschers who develop cardiomyopathy die suddenly from seemingly unknown causes, and an additional fifty percent die of congestive heart failure. Among female Dobermanns, the sudden death manifestation of the disease is more common, whereas males tend to develop congestive heart failure.  In addition to being more prevalent in Dobermanns, this disease is also more serious in the breed. Following a diagnosis, the average non-Dobermann has an expected survival time of 8 months; for Dobermann Pinschers, however, the expected survival time is less than two months. Although the causes for the disease are largely unknown, there is evidence that it is a familial disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Investigation into the genetic causes of canine DCM may lead to therapeutic and breeding practices to limit its impact.

History

Dobermanns were first bred in the 1880s by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in Apolda, Thuringia, Germany, a tax collector who ran the Apolda dog pound. With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after Dobermann's death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s.

The breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the Beauceron, German Pinscher, Rottweiler and Weimaraner. The single exception is the documented crossing with the Greyhound and Manchester Terrier. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's The Dobermann Pinscher (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The American Kennel Club believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.

After Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an ""n"" from Dobermann's surname.

During World War II, the United States Marine Corps adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official war dog, although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.

In the United States, the American Kennel Club ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.

Popularity
The Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time. It is a relatively new breed, less than 150 years old. According to the latest ranking in 2017 by the American Kennel Club, Dobermanns are the 16th most popular dog breed. Dobermanns started to become popular when they were used in World War II as guard dogs. In the 1970s, Dobermanns had their fair share in movies. They starred in the 1972 American film The Doberman Gang. Dobermanns also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Shows in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing.

Songs written by Thorsten BrötzmannFrederick George Burgess (16 July 1871 – 31 March 1951) was a British politician and trade unionist.

Burgess worked on the railways for many years and became active in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and its successor, the National Union of Railwaymen.  Increasingly holding prominent offices in the union, including secretary of the Maidstone branch for seventeen years, he also served on various government committees during World War I.  He also became active in the Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully for Maidstone at the 1918 general election.  Despite his lack of success, he left the railway industry the following year (refusing a post as night porter at NUR headquarters), and worked as a political agent and lecturer, also producing political cartoons and articles under the pseudonym of ""Battersea Bowser"".

At the 1929 general election, Burgess stood in York and won the seat.  He lost it at the 1931 general election, then moved to contest Accrington in 1935, but was again unsuccessful.  In 1937, he was elected to represent Camberwell North West on London County Council, serving until 1949.  He also served on Camberwell Metropolitan Borough Council. He served as Camberwell's mayor from 1947 until 1949, taking over from his wife Jessie Burgess who held the role from 1945 to 1947.

41,280,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type6,"Halocnemum strobilaceum is a species of flowering plant in the subfamily Salicornioideae of the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea and parts of the Middle East and central Asia, where it grows in coastal and inland salt marshes, alkali flats, and other habitats with saline soils.

Description
Halocnemum strobilaceum is a much-branched, semi-prostrate, sub-shrub with erect branches up to a metre or so high. The woody stems at the base are jointed and have sterile, rounded or conical shaped buds, arranged in whorls on the terminal part of each portion. The erect stems are  cylindrical and succulent, with green joints that turn yellow as they age. The stubby, bluish-green, scale-like leaves clasp the stem at each node. The flowers are hermaphrodite and very small, and are arranged in whorls of three on the upper part of the branches.

Distribution and habitat
Halocnemum strobilaceum is found around the coasts bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. It is also present in the Middle East and central Asia as far east as Mongolia and China. In Iran and Pakistan, it grows in the muddy coastal swamps immediately inland from the mangroves (Avicennia marina) that border the coast of the Persian Gulf. In the delta region of the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, it dominates some plant communities in the salt marsh habitats. In Abu Dhabi it grows in lagoons with muddy substrates in association with Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, and along the storm ridges of shelly sand that form higher up the beach. Gelatinous crusts of cyanobacteria sometimes form in depressions in the ground, and when these get dusted with windblown sand, H. strobilaceum colonises these habitats too. It grows along the sandy Tunisian coast, forming hummocks, growing alongside Bassia muricata, Cutandia memphitica and Traganum nudatum.

In northwestern China in the provinces of Xinjiang and Gansu, it is one of the dominant plants on saline plains, on the shores of salt lakes and at the edges of alluvial fans. Along with glasswort and A. macrostachyum, H. strobilaceum was one of the first plants to recolonise oil-polluted marshland in the Persian Gulf after the soil had been churned up and aerated by the action of crabs.

Gastropods described in 1818Extensive growth, in economics, is growth in the quantity of output produced based on the expansion of the quantity of inputs used. It contrasts with intensive growth, which arises from inputs being used more productively. For example, GDP growth caused only by increases in population or territory would be extensive growth. Thus, extensive growth is likely to be subject to diminishing returns. It is therefore often viewed as having no effect on per-capita magnitudes in the long-run. 

Reliance on extensive growth can be undesirable in the long-run because it exhausts resources. To maintain economic growth in the long-run, especially on a per-capita basis, it is good for an economy to grow intensively—for example, by improvements in technology or organisation, thereby shifting the economy’s production possibilities frontier outward.

Track listing

Critical reception

The album was generally well received by critics. Pitchfork wrote that ""Compared to Primordial’s past successes, the stripped-and-centered approach might seem simplistic, but the hour-long result is more immediate because of it. From beginning to end, Fallen feels like a compulsory listen."" About.com's Dan Drago also praised the album, concluding in his review that ""Where Greater Men Have Fallen is more proof of their ability to grow and maintain such a high level of songwriting. Equal in stature to their last two releases, they seem to be reaching new heights and very few bands can match their passion. They have once again released a sure candidate for album of the year.""

Many critics were particularly complimentary towards A.A. Nemtheanga's vocals on the album. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kim Kelly wrote that ""Alan Averill is a vocal powerhouse, soaring atop melodic black/folk metal compositions that channel doom and gloom as well as triumph. [...] When Averill howls ""The heart of your motherland will be ripped from her chest,"" a million ghosts cry out with him.""

Republican
ConnecticutMassimiliano Antonio ""Max"" Cavalera (, born August 4, 1969) is a Brazilian singer, guitarist, and songwriter who currently plays in heavy metal bands Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy, and Killer Be Killed. In 1984, he co-founded the death metal/thrash metal band Sepultura with his brother Igor Cavalera and was the band's lead singer and rhythm guitarist until 1996. Cavalera was also involved in a short-lived side project called Nailbomb.

Early life and career 
Max Cavalera's father, Graziano Cavalera, was an employee of the Italian Consulate in Belo Horizonte. He died at 41 years of age, when Max was nine years old. Cavalera's family was in a state of financial crisis and family turbulence when he formed Sepultura with his younger brother Igor. In the early 1990s, he relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. He did not begin to make spiritual music until after he quit Sepultura. His earlier lyrics for Soulfly were influenced by religion and spirituality, though he is critical of religion. His later albums, starting with Dark Ages, began to incorporate lyrical themes of violence, warfare, anger and hatred. His albums have all been dedicated to God, and he has often been depicted by the press as a man of religion, especially in the United States, something that Cavalera himself says he does not understand:

I do hate a lot of ""religion"", but people like Christ – yeah they inspire me. I mean if you look at Christ, He was hanging around with the lowlifes, prostitutes and the losers you know, not going around with those high society motherfuckers you see trying to sell Jesus today!

When asked in an interview whether he was a Christian and whether Soulfly was a Christian band, he said:

No. I mean, if I was a Christian I would wear all these different kinds of omens. Because Christian people are so close-minded. A priest would not accept that. So I don't like the concept of Christianity in terms of being so close-minded. It is the same with music. Sometimes I compare preachers to close-minded musicians or close-minded listeners, who only like one kind of music. Some preachers are the same. And they don't tolerate Hindus, Buddhists or whatever. Only them. It's bullshit. So Soulfly is not a Christian band at all. Very much opposite. But we are very spiritual. Spiritual has nothing to do with Christianity anyway. It has been here since the beginning of time.

In another interview, he was asked about the Varg Vikernes church burnings. He quoted, ""I support church burnings 100 percent, but why don't we just burn everything. Mosques, temples, all religious buildings."" However, he later claimed his views changed about the church burnings and called them ""too violent"". He has stated that he does believe in God, ""But it might be different than the God the preacher preaches about.""

Of enduring influence to his music, is the untimely death of his stepson, Dana Wells, who was killed after the release of Roots in 1996. The songs ""Bleed"", ""First Commandment"", ""Pain"", ""Tree of Pain"" and ""Revengeance"" are tributes to Wells, as well as Deftones' song ""Headup"", in which Cavalera featured and co-wrote. He reunited with his brother Igor, in their band Cavalera Conspiracy, and wrote and performed on Soulfly's Conquer, released in 2008.

Cavalera appears in the 2009 video game Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned as himself on the ingame radio station LCHC.

In 2013, Cavalera released his autobiography, titled My Bloody Roots; his co-writer was the British author Joel McIver and the book's foreword was written by Dave Grohl.

Guitar style 

Cavalera is known for playing his guitar with only four strings; with the B and high E strings opted out. The inspiration struck when he broke both strings one day and he did not bother to replace them. A friend later commented that the guitar looked better without them, thus it became his trademark.

Personal life 
Since 1992, Cavalera has lived in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife Gloria (b. 1953) and his five children: Igor Amadeus (b. 1995), Zyon (b. 1993), Jason (b. 1986), Richie (b. 1985), and Roxanne (b. 1983). The three eldest, Gloria's children, were adopted by Cavalera, making Cavalera their legal father. Zyon, Igor, and Richie have all collaborated with Cavalera in his various projects. Three of his sons are also active in music, with Richie fronting Incite and Igor and Zyon performing in Lody Kong. Jason tours as Zyon's drum tech, amongst other various duties behind the scenes. In 2012 and 2013, Zyon toured with Soulfly after David Kinkade's retirement, and now he is a regular member as drummer. Igor briefly filled in as bassist for Soulfly in 2015 after Tony Campos left the band, and toured as keyboardist and co-vocalist during Soulfly's Point Blank Tour. Igor was born with type 1 diabetes, and Max and Gloria set up the ""Iggy Fund"" in 1998 to help other families get necessary medicine for their children with juvenile diabetes.

Collaborations 

Cavalera has collaborated with many different artists while in Sepultura and Soulfly. In 2003 he joined forces with former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters' frontman Dave Grohl to produce ""Red War"" for the self-titled release of Dave Grohl's metal project, Probot.

Musicians 
Cavalera has worked with the following musicians:

Cavalera appeared in The Scorpion King in an off-camera role, providing the guttural screams for Dwayne Johnson.

Expendable space launch systemsSaul Matthews  was an enslaved African American who spied for the Continental Army during American Revolutionary War.  He spied on the British, obtaining valuable information for the Patriots. As a result of this, he was given his full freedom from slavery by the Virginia legislature in 1792:  ""In consideration of many very essential services rendered to this Commonwealth during the late war … full liberty and freedom … as if he was born free.""

Slavery 
Born in Virginia, Saul Mathews was a slave of Thomas Mathews.

American Revolutionary War 
In 1781 General Cornwallis and his troops captured Portsmouth, Virginia. Saul Matthews was under the command of Colonel Josiah Parker when several times Parker ordered him to go into British camps and spy on them. He always returned with much success and information, even though he was forced back into slavery for about 10 years. In 1792 he successfully petitioned the Virginia General Assembly for freedom again.

Players of American football from PennsylvaniaThe National Museum of American Jewish History (NMAJH) is a Smithsonian-affiliated museum at 101 South Independence Mall East (S. 5th Street) at Market Street in Center City Philadelphia.  It was founded in 1976.

In March 2020, The National Museum of American Jewish History filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking relief from debt incurred by the construction of its Independence Mall home. The museum's debts included over $30 million to bondholders, and an additional $500,000 to unsecured creditors; at the time of the bankruptcy filing, the museum was paying 20% of its annual budget in interest payments. The filing followed several years of decreasing attendance, revenue, and fundraising. The museum's operations were not affected by the bankruptcy. The museum exited bankruptcy in September 2021.

History

With its founding in 1976, the then– museum shared a building with the Congregation Mikveh Israel.

In 2005, it was announced that the museum would be moved to a new building to be built at Fifth Street and Market Street on the Independence Mall. The site was originally owned by CBS' KYW radio and KYW-TV. The project broke ground on September 30, 2007. The  glass and terra-cotta building was designed by James Polshek and includes an atrium, a  area for exhibits, a Center for Jewish Education, and a theater. The structural engineer was Leslie E. Robertson Associates.

The project, including endowment, cost $150 million. The opening ceremony was held November 14, 2010 and was attended by over 1,000 people, including Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Michael Nutter, Governor Ed Rendell, and Rabbi Irving Greenberg. The building opened to the public November 26, 2010.

In 2012 Ivy Barsky was appointed as the CEO of the museum and she served until 2019. During her tenure the George Washington 1790 letter was given on permanent loan.

In March 2020 the museum closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and staff wages were reduced. In May the museum furloughed two thirds of its staff without pay. The acting CEO was Misha Galperin who had taken over when Barsby resigned the year before. The staff were not entitled to some benefits because of the museum being in chapter 19 protection.

In August 2020, following the signing ceremony for the Great American Outdoors Act in which President Donald Trump mispronounced the name of Yosemite National Park as ""yo-semites"", the museum's online gift shop experienced a surge in sales for a pre-existing, similarly phrased ""Yo Semite"" T-shirt. Sales of the shirt, which brought in $30,000 in the three days following Trump's statement and led to continued sales thereafter, provided unexpected international publicity and required financial assistance to the museum.

Exhibitions
Exhibits use pieces from the museum's collection which includes over 30,000 objects and ranges from the Colonial period to the present day. Exhibits have focused on the lives and experiences of Jews in America, with past exhibitions centering on Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Leonard Bernstein. Professor Jonathan Sarna of Brandeis University led the development of the core exhibit for the museum.

To Bigotry No Sanction: George Washington and Religious Freedom

In 2012, the NMAJH held a special exhibition that featured one of the most important documents pertaining to religious freedom in the United States. The letter was written in 1790 to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, addressing the new country's religious freedom. George Washington's letter expressed the new government's commitment for religious freedom and equality for all faiths. The exhibition included numerous artifacts as well as early printings of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Hall of Fame and Gallery
Established in 2010, the National Museum of American Jewish History Hall of Fame and a related permanent exhibition gallery honors the lives of prominent Jewish Americans. The initial class of eighteen inductees was chosen both by a public vote and a panel of historians and experts. Inductees were elected in one of eight categories. In its opening year, the exhibit contained a film about the inductees’ lives and artifacts, including Sandy Koufax’s baseball mitt and sheet music from Irving Berlin. The exhibition was renamed the Ed Snider 'Only in America' Gallery and Hall of Fame in honor of the former chairman of Comcast Spectacor.

History
""Gloriæ Dei Cantores"" was founded in 1988 by Elizabeth C. Patterson, who served as its Director/Conductor until 2012. It is based at the Church of the Transfiguration in Orleans, Massachusetts. The ""Gloriæ Dei Cantores Schola"" specializes in Gregorian chant.

The choir sings in 18 languages, and has appeared on the concert stage and in recordings with such artists as Gerre Hancock, Keith Lockhart, John Williams, Samuel Adler, Mark O'Connor, Stephen Cleobury, George Guest, Daniel Pinkham, and Margaret Hillis. It has toured in 23 countries in Europe, Asia, and North America.

Highlights of the choir's career under Conductor Emeritus Elizabeth Patterson and current Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Richard K. Pugsley include three invitational tours of Russia, the opening of the 900th anniversary of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, Italy, live radio and television broadcasts with the BBC, film soundtracks, and the tree-lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Plaza.

The choir's collaborative ventures have included ten Holiday Tours with Keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops Orchestra, a sixteen-city US tour of Mozart's Requiem with Philippe Entremont and the Munich Symphony Orchestra, and performances of Mozart's Requiem with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic in Russia.

In October 2017, the choir and its associated Elements Theatre Company presented at the Church of the Transfiguration, Vaughn Williams' opera, The Pilgrim's Progress, to celebrate 500 years of the Protestant Reformation.

Recent concerts have featured Walton's The Twelve, Poulenc's Gloria Durufle's Requiem, Mozart's Mass in C minor, and Vaughan Williams' Dona Nobis Pacem, in collaboration with soloists Andrew Nolen and Jossie Pérez.

Discography
The choir has released a number of recordings on their Paraclete Recordings label.

Gordon Myers was Chairman of the Music Department, Columbia College, Columbia, South Carolina, from 1965 to 1968. He wrote a 90-minute choral work, ""God’s Trombones by James Weldon Johnson"" as his doctoral thesis, subsequently published by Eastlane Music Corporation. In 1996, Paraclete Press, the publishing house of the Community of Jesus, acquired the copyright. It was recorded by ""Gloriæ Dei Cantores"" in the mid 1990s. Using the masters, Paraclete Records prepared them for re-release in 2018. The Gloriæ Dei Cantores choir serves as chorus to Myers' baritone. C. Michael Bailey, writing for ""All That Jazz"" recommended the recording calling it, ""...a very listenable collection of Bible tales...""

""Alan Hovhaness: From the Ends of the Earth"" received a favorable review from Music Web International's Dan Morgan, who noted the acoustics of the Church of the Transfiguration. In reviewing Mozart Rare Choral Works, Michael Cookson said, ""...although there are episodes of unsteadiness and one or two uncomfortable vibratos it is hard to find too much fault with their performances.""

Reception
Everything I Need To Know received mixed reviews. A reviewer for the Sydney Morning Herald, although calling it ""a nostalgic trip with wonderful illustrations"", was disappointed about its lack of depth (""Perhaps the saddest part of Muldrow's otherwise uplifting book is her treatment of The Saggy Baggy Elephant.""), and that some stories (Scuffy the Tugboat, The Bunny Book) were not included.

It has also been reviewed by Kirkus Reviews that called it ""Chicken soup for fans of Golden Books"", Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, and Radio New Zealand.

It is a best seller.

The C-sharp major scale is:

Its relative minor is A-sharp minor (or enharmonically B-flat minor) and its parallel minor is C-sharp minor.

Characteristics 
A harp tuned to C-sharp major has all its pedals in the bottom position. Because all the strings are then pinched and shortened, this is the least resonant key for the instrument.

Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D-flat major since it only contains five flats as opposed to C-sharp major's seven sharps. However, Johann Sebastian Bach chose C-sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No. 3 in both books of The Well-Tempered Clavier, and Charles-Valentin Alkan chose C-sharp major for Etude Op. 35 No. 9 ""Contrapunctus"" in Twelve etudes in all the major keys, Op. 35. In Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6, Franz Liszt takes the unusual step of changing the key from D-flat major to C-sharp major near the beginning of the piece, and then soon back again to B-flat minor. Maurice Ravel selected C-sharp major as the tonic key of ""Ondine"" from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit. Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, Op. 17, in the key of C-sharp major.

The Allegro de concierto by Spanish composer Enrique Granados is written in C-sharp major. Canadian composer and pianist Frank Mills originally wrote and performed his instrumental hit ""Music Box Dancer"" in C-sharp major.  However, most modern piano editions have the piece written in the Key of C major.

Louis Vierne used C-sharp major for the ""Dona nobis pacem"" of the Agnus Dei of his Messe Solennelle in C-sharp minor.

Musical keys
Major scalesTalking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band was composed of Scottish-born David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), drummer Chris Frantz, bassist Tina Weymouth, and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described as ""one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s"", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with an anxious, clean-cut image.

As former art school students who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their 1977 debut album, Talking Heads: 77, to positive reviews. They collaborated with producer Brian Eno on a trio of critically acclaimed releases—More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980)—which blended their art school punk sensibilities with influence from artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic and Fela Kuti. By the early 1980s, they began to expand their band by including a number of additional musicians in recording sessions and stage shows, notably guitarist Adrian Belew, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, singer Nona Hendryx, and bassist Busta Jones.

After a hiatus, Talking Heads hit their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Top 10 hit ""Burning Down the House"" from the album Speaking in Tongues and released the concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme. For these performances, the band was joined by Worrell, guitarist Alex Weir, percussionist Steve Scales, and singers Lynn Mabry and Ednah Holt. In 1985, Talking Heads released their best-selling album, Little Creatures. They produced a soundtrack album for Byrne' film True Stories (1986), and released their final album, worldbeat-influenced Naked (1988), before disbanding in 1991. Without Byrne, the other band members performed under the name Shrunken Heads, and released an album, No Talking, Just Head, as the Heads in 1996.

In 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their albums appear in Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and three of their songs (""Psycho Killer"", ""Life During Wartime"", and ""Once in a Lifetime"") were included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Talking Heads were also number 64 on VH1's list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In the 2011 update of Rolling Stones ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"", they were ranked number 100.

History

1973-1977: Early years
In 1973, Rhode Island School of Design students David Byrne (guitar and vocals) and Chris Frantz (drums) formed a band, the Artistics. Fellow student Tina Weymouth, Frantz's girlfriend, often provided transportation. The Artistics dissolved the following year, and the three moved to New York City, eventually sharing a communal loft. After they were unable to find a bassist, Weymouth took up the role. Frantz encouraged Weymouth to learn to play bass by listening to Suzi Quatro albums. Byrne asked Weymouth to audition three times before she joined the band.

The band played their first gig as Talking Heads opening for the Ramones at CBGB on June 5, 1975. According to Weymouth, the name Talking Heads came from an issue of TV Guide, which ""explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as 'all content, no action'. It fit."" Later that year, the band recorded a series of demos for CBS, but did not earn a record contract. However, they drew a following and signed to Sire Records in November 1976. They released their first single in February the following year, ""Love → Building on Fire"". In March 1977, they added Jerry Harrison, formerly of Jonathan Richman's band the Modern Lovers, on keyboards, guitar, and backing vocals.

The first Talking Heads album, Talking Heads: 77, received acclaim and produced their first charting single, ""Psycho Killer"". Many connected the song to the serial killer known as the Son of Sam, who had been terrorizing New York City months earlier; however, Byrne said he had written the song years prior. Weymouth and Frantz married in 1977.

1978–1980: Collaborations with Eno

More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978) was Talking Heads' first collaboration with producer Brian Eno, who had previously worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie, John Cale and Robert Fripp; the title of Eno's 1977 song ""King's Lead Hat"" is an anagram of the band's name. Eno's unusual style meshed with the group's artistic sensibilities, and they began to explore an increasingly diverse range of musical directions, from post-punk to psychedelic funk to African music, influenced prominently by Fela Kuti and Parliament-Funkadelic. This recording also established the band's relationship with Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. More Songs About Buildings and Food included a cover of Al Green's ""Take Me to the River"". This broke Talking Heads into the general public's consciousness and gave the band their first Billboard Top 30 hit.

The collaboration continued with Fear of Music (1979), with the darker stylings of post-punk rock, mixed with white funkadelia and subliminal references to the geopolitical instability of the late 1970s. Music journalist Simon Reynolds cited Fear of Music as representing the Eno-Talking Heads collaboration ""at its most mutually fruitful and equitable"". The single ""Life During Wartime"" produced the catchphrase ""This ain't no party, this ain't no disco."" The song refers to the Mudd Club and CBGB, two popular New York nightclubs of the time.

Remain in Light (1980) was heavily influenced by the afrobeat of Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti, whose music Eno had introduced to the band. It explored West African polyrhythms, weaving these together with Arabic music from North Africa, disco funk, and ""found"" voices. These combinations foreshadowed Byrne's later interest in world music. In order to perform these more complex arrangements, the band toured with an expanded group, including Adrian Belew and Bernie Worrell, among others, first at the Heatwave festival in August, and later in their concert film Stop Making Sense. During this period, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz also formed a commercially successful splinter group, Tom Tom Club, influenced by the foundational elements of hip hop, and Harrison released his first solo album, The Red and the Black. Likewise, Byrne—in collaboration with Eno—released My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, which incorporated world music and found sounds, as well as including a number of other prominent international and post-punk musicians. All were released by Sire.

Remain in Lights lead single, ""Once in a Lifetime"", became a Top 20 hit in the UK, but initially failed to make an impression in the USA. It grew into a popular standard over the next few years on the strength of its music video, which was named one of Time's All-TIME Best Music Videos.

1981–1991: Commercial peak and breakup
After releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2.

1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band's only American Top 10 hit, ""Burning Down the House"". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme's Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last.

Three more albums followed: 1985's Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles ""And She Was"" and ""Road to Nowhere""), 1986's True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne's musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988's Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group's most successful hits, ""Wild Wild Life"", and the accordion-driven track ""Radio Head"". Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne's control and, after Naked, the band went on ""hiatus"". In 1987 Talking Heads released a book by David Byrne called What the Songs Look Like: Contemporary Artists Interpret Talking Heads Songs with Harper Collins that contained artwork by some of the top New York visual artists of the decade.

In December 1991, Talking Heads announced that they had disbanded. Frantz said that he learned that Byrne had left from an article in the Los Angeles Times, and said: ""As far as we're concerned, the band never really broke up. David just decided to leave."" Their final release was ""Sax and Violins"", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World. Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in 1990.

1992–2002: Post-breakup and final reunion
Weymouth, Frantz, and Harrison toured without Byrne as Shrunken Heads in the early 90s. In 1996, they released an album, No Talking, Just Head, under the name the Heads. The album featured a number of vocalists, including Gavin Friday of The Virgin Prunes, Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. It was accompanied by a tour with Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action to prevent the band using the name The Heads, which he saw as ""a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name"". The band briefly reunited in 1999 to promote the 15th anniversary re-release of Stop Making Sense, but did not perform together.

Harrison produced records including the Violent Femmes' The Blind Leading the Naked, the Fine Young Cannibals' The Raw and the Cooked, General Public's Rub It Better, Crash Test Dummies' God Shuffled His Feet, Live's Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper and The Distance to Here, No Doubt's song ""New"" from Return of Saturn. Frantz and Weymouth have produced several artists, including Happy Mondays and Ziggy Marley. The Tom Tom Club continue to record and tour intermittently.
Talking Heads reunited to play ""Life During Wartime"", ""Psycho Killer"", and ""Burning Down the House"" on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, joined on stage by former touring members Bernie Worrell and Steve Scales. Byrne said further work together was unlikely, due to ""bad blood"" and being musically ""miles apart"". Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as ""a man incapable of returning friendship"" and saying that he doesn't ""love"" her, Frantz, and Harrison.

Influence
AllMusic stated that Talking Heads, one of the most celebrated bands of the 1970s and 1980s, by the time of their breakup ""had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop"". Talking Heads' art pop innovations have had a long-lasting impact. Along with other groups such as Devo, Ramones, and Blondie, they helped define the new wave genre in the United States. Meanwhile, the more worldly popularities like 1980's Remain in Light helped bring African rock to the western world.  Their 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme, was critically acclaimed upon its theatrical release, and is considered one of the best concert films ever released.

Talking Heads have been cited as an influence by many artists, including Eddie Vedder, Foals, the Weeknd, Vampire Weekend, Primus, Bell X1, the 1975, the Ting Tings, Nelly Furtado, Kesha, St. Vincent, Danny Brown, Trent Reznor, Franz Ferdinand and Radiohead, who took their name from the Talking Heads song ""Radio Head"" from the 1986 album True Stories. The Italian filmmaker and director Paolo Sorrentino, in receiving the Oscar for his film La Grande Bellezza in 2014, thanked Talking Heads, among others, as his sources of inspiration.

 Sweeny (disambiguation)
 Justice Sweeney (disambiguation)The de Havilland DH 112 Venom is a British post-war single-engined jet aircraft developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. Much of its design was derived from the de Havilland Vampire, the firm's first jet-powered combat aircraft.

The Venom entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), where it was used as a single-seat fighter-bomber and two-seat night fighter. A dedicated model for aerial reconnaissance was also operated by the Swiss Air Force. The Venom functioned as an interim stage between the first generation of British jet fighters – straight-wing aircraft powered by centrifugal flow engines such as the Gloster Meteor and the Vampire – and later swept wing, axial flow-engined combat aircraft, such as the Hawker Hunter and de Havilland Sea Vixen. Accordingly, the type had a relatively short service life in the RAF, being withdrawn from frontline operations by the service in 1962 as a result of the introduction of more capable designs. However, it was used in combat during the Suez Crisis, the Malayan Emergency, and the Aden Emergency.

The Venom proved to be popular on the export market, being sold in substantial numbers to Iraq, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela. The Swiss Air Force was the last active military operator of the Venom, retiring their last examples during 1983. Large numbers of ex-military Venoms have since been acquired by private entities and several have continued to fly, performing aerial displays at various air shows, while many examples have been preserved in static display conditions in museums and as gate guardians. A specialised derivative, the Sea Venom, was produced as a navalised version of the aircraft suitable for carrier operations.

Development

Origins

In 1948, de Havilland proposed a development of the Vampire, furnished with a thinner wing and a more powerful engine, to serve as a high altitude fighter, designated as the Vampire FB 8. The design gradually shifted, becoming the DH 112 Venom, in order to fill an Air Ministry requirement, Specification F.15/49, which sought a fast, manoeuvrable and capable fighter-bomber to replace the Royal Air Force's (RAF) existing Vampires in that capacity. From the onset, the envisioned role had been intended as an interim fighter-bomber, while the development of aircraft capable of even greater performance had already been anticipated by the service.

Although generally similar in appearance to the preceding Vampire, sharing the distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure, the Venom was a completely new design. As originally designed, it was powered by the de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine, which was capable of generating 4,850lb of thrust, considerably more powerful than the earlier de Havilland Goblin that had been used on the Vampire. The Venom adopted a wing designed with a leading edge sweepback of 17.6 degrees, a minimised thickness/chord ratio reduced from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, while the trailing edge was straight; a pair of optionally-fitted wing tip tanks were also designed to be fitted without any negative impact on the aircraft's overall combat maneuvering capability.

In order to test elements of the new design, a single Vampire F 1 was converted and outfitting with the new Ghost engine. On 2 September 1949, the first Venom prototype, VV612, performed its maiden flight at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, piloted by John Derry. In May 1950, following the end of company trials, the prototype was delivered to RAF Boscombe Down for official trials by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). In the course of these trials, the aircraft proved capable of satisfactory performance, including the besting of some contemporary fighters during mock combat, while some minor faults were also uncovered. On 23 May 1950, the second prototype, VV613, officially joined the development programme; it was delivered to the A&AEE for further trials on 3 April 1951.

The first six production Venom also participated in trials performed by both de Havilland and the A&AEE. On 21 April 1952, the first delivery of a production-standard Venom, a single-seat fighter-bomber, occurred to the Central Fighter Establishment, where it was used for a full service evaluation prior to the type being cleared for active service. During 1952, the initial production model entered operational service with the RAF as the Venom FB 1. A total of 375 of this initial model were constructed.

Further development

On 22 August 1950, an improved Venom, the NF.2 night fighter, performed its first flight, piloted by John Derry. de Havilland had developed it from the single seat ground attack-oriented Venom to serve as a replacement for the Vampire NF 10. For this variant, the fuselage was redesigned to accommodate a two-man crew, (pilot and navigator/radar operator), seated in a side-by-side configuration, and an airborne interception radar installed in the extended nose. During late 1953, the Venom NF.2 entered squadron service, after being delayed to resolve minor problems that had been discovered. Specifically, preliminary handling trials had revealed unsatisfactory performance in poor weather conditions.

The Venom NF.2 was modified after being involved in several accidents in which pilots had difficulty making night-time approaches. Changes included the adoption of jettisonable clear canopies and alterations to the flight control surfaces, and the altered aircraft were re-designated NF.2As. The Venom NF.2 was soon followed by the NF 3, which was the ultimate night fighter variant of the Venom. It incorporated further improvements, including power-actuated ailerons and an improved air interception radar. In 1953, the Venom NF 3 performed its first flight; it entered operational service with the RAF during June 1955.

The final Venom for the RAF was the single-seat FB.4 which first flew on 29 December 1953. It entered service in 1955 and 250 were built. It was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine. It was the first Venom to be fitted with an ejector seat, as well as being furnished with redesigned tail surfaces and hydraulically-powered ailerons. The new rudder design prevented excessive yaw and eliminated incidents of rudder locking at low speeds. The FB 4 variant was the first to be compatible with the underwing fuel tanks.

The majority of the type's production was conducted by de Havilland themselves. Following the completion of an initial batch of 15 production Venoms, manufacturing was transferred from de Havilland's Hatfield facility to their larger production plant at Hawarden Airport. On 26 July 1952, the first Hawarden-built Venom was delivered to the RAF. In addition, the construction effort was augmented by numbers of Venom FB.1, FB.4 and NF.51 aircraft that were produced by Fairey Aviation at Manchester (Ringway) Airport. At one point, the production of further Venoms at the Bristol Aeroplane Company's Filton facility was considered but was ultimately not pursued. During the early 1950s, the prospects for Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione producing the type under license were explored; these did not materialise however. 

Due to substantial demand from the Swiss Air Force, a license production arrangement was established with a consortium of Swiss aviation manufacturers in 1953, who did produce large numbers of Venoms. In the early 1970s Swiss Venoms were equipped with a new extended nose to add space for the addition of a ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, an Identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder and a SAAB BT-9K ballistic computer for its ground attack ordnance.

Design
The de Havilland Venom was a jet-propelled combat aircraft, featuring a distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure. Originally developed as a ground-attack fighter, it served as an interceptor as well. It possessed a favourable rate of climb and other positive characteristics that lent itself well to combat operations, and represented a significant advance over the preceding Vampire. It was a sound ground attack aircraft, possessing good maneuverability, steadiness, endurance, handling, and a range of compatible stores. The Venom's manoeuvrability even gave it an edge against many dogfighters of the era, although its limited top speed proved to be a weakness in this role. Early issues, such as a rear spar weakness and flash fires due to the ingestion of vented fuel by the engine air intakes under some conditions, were quickly identified and overcome.

The Venom FB 1 was armed with four nose-mounted 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk V autocannons and could carry either two 1,000 lb (approx 450 kg) bombs or eight RP-3 60 lb (27 kg) air-to-ground rocket projectiles – the heavier bombs being an improvement over the Vampire FB 5. For additional range, each of the wing tips could accommodate the installation of a 75gal tip tank, freeing up the underwing stores positions for other stores and munitions, these were not jettisonable during flight. When installed, the tip tanks had the effect of improving the aircraft's roll rate, which was lower than many of its contemporaries. Early production Venoms commonly suffered from weaknesses within the wing structure, leading to flight limitations and warning markings being applied to distinguish them from typical aircraft.

The Venom FB 1 was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust Ghost 48 Mk.1 turbojet engine; later marks were equipped with increasingly powerful models. The engine was ignited using explosive cartridges, known as Coffman engine starters; at the time, many operators were not previously familiar with such means of start up. Early production models lacked ejection seats, which was subject to official criticism; in response, later production models were furnished with them. The airframe itself had a relatively short life due to having been designed for its role as a short term interim aircraft pending development of what would become the Hawker Hunter; in Swiss service, where the type was subject to a lengthy service life, several strengthening modifications were performed to more than double its viable lifespan. It was known for its simplicity in construction and relative cost-effectiveness, which contributed to its popularity to export customers.

Operational history

In August 1952, No. 11 Squadron become the first overseas squadron to convert to the Venom in exchange for their existing Vampires inventory; No. 11 was responsible for conducting the type's operational service trials for the service. Upon their introduction to service, none of the single-seat fighter-bomber Venoms were deployed to home-based squadrons; priority was given to overseas forces, such as the Second Tactical Air Force stationed in Germany as well as those stationed in hotter climates where the benefits of the more powerful engine were most felt, such as Cyprus, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

During September 1952, the Venom participated in its first NATO training operation, Exercise Mainbrace. In mid-1953, a second Venom wing, consisting of Nos. 14, 98 and 118 Squadrons, was formed at RAF Fassberg, Lower Saxony; a third wing, comprising No.s 16, 94, and 145 Squadrons, was also formed at RAF Celle, Lower Saxony, during the following year. In this capacity, the Venom was only operated for a short time, those squadrons stationed at RAF Faßberg transitioned to the Hawker Hunter in 1955, while those at RAF Celle were disbanded in 1957.

Throughout the mid-1950s, Venoms were dispatched to the furthest corners of the British Empire, being typically used to replace the Vampire in the fighter-bomber role. In August 1955, a flight of four Venoms conducted a 10,000 flight from RAF Habbaniya, Iraq to Wingfield Aerodrome, South Africa and back; while on the return leg of this journey, a speed record was set on the Cape Town-Pretoria route, covering the 807-mile distance in 1 hour 23 minutes.

On 6 May 1953, the first of the Venom night fighters was delivered to the RAF. From 1955 onwards, an improved model of the night fighter, the Venom NF.3, was introduced to squadron service. However, the night fighter Venom had only a relatively brief career with the RAF, having been procured to serve as an interim solution while more capable designs were developed. Accordingly, in 1957, the RAF's night fighter Venoms began to be withdrawn in favour of the newly introduced Gloster Javelin twin-engined all-weather fighter. In the night fighter role, the Venom was also adopted by export customers; the Swedish Air Force adopted the type as their principal night fighter in 1955 and operated three squadrons in this capacity.

RAF Venoms saw action during the Malayan Emergency, which took place between 1948 and 1960, although these aircraft did not commence operations until the mid-1950s with Nos. 45 and 60 Squadrons. While there, the Venom supported counterinsurgency operations against Communist guerrillas as part of Operation Firedog, the codename for RAF operations in Malaya. By 15 November 1957, the day on which the Venom was withdrawn from combat in the theatre, the type had conducted more than 300 strikes against guerillas. Several Venoms were lent to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for use during the same conflict, being operated by No. 14 Squadron RNZAF.

The Venom also saw combat service during the Suez Crisis during late 1956. The type was operated by Nos. 6, 8 and 249 Squadrons, flying from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. The Anglo-French invasion, codenamed Operation Musketeer, took place in response to the nationalisation of the Suez Canal by Egypt's leader, General Nasser. The air war began on 31 October 1956. The Venoms attacked a variety of military installations on the ground; only a single RAF Venom was lost throughout the crisis.

From 1956 onwards, Middle Eastern-based RAF squadrons progressively received the improved Venom FB 4. Starting in 1956, RAF Venoms were deployed during the Aden Emergency, where they were used in support of counterinsurgency operations against terrorists and rebel tribesmen in Aden and Oman. In 1957, British RAF Venoms participated heavily during Jebel Akhdar War in Oman to expand the territory of the Sultanate, which was a de facto British colony, in order to gain access to oil wells in the interior parts of Oman. The RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958 targeting insurgents, mountain top villages, water channels and crops in a war that remained under low profile. As the conflict progressed, squadrons equipped with the Venom were reequipped, mainly by the English Electric Canberra; in 1960, the final squadron in the region that used the type was reequipped with the Hawker Hunter.

Outside of the RAF, the Swiss Air Force were the most prolific user of the Venom. In addition to the domestic production of 136 ground attack-orientated models and its Ghost engine to power them, Switzerland also produced a dedicated aerial reconnaissance variant of the aircraft, which were outfitted with specially modified underwing fuel tanks that had automated cameras installed in the forward section. Swiss Venoms were also subject to multiple improvement and upgrade programmes, including life extension modifications, the addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio sets, and an improved license-built bombsight.

In 1962, all of the remaining Venoms in RAF service were withdrawn from first-line duties, having proven their worth in a variety of locations across the world, in peace and war, and in some of the most difficult climates the RAF has ever faced. The last non-RAF Venoms to leave active service were the aircraft in service with the Swiss Air Force, the last of which being retired from combat duties during the latter part of 1983. About 10–20 Venoms continue to fly as of 2017, performing at various air shows, while a number of examples are preserved in museums in the United Kingdom and abroad, in non-flying, static display condition.

Aircraft on display

The Venom has been preserved in significant numbers, mainly due to its longevity with the Swiss Air Force. In the UK, a number of Sea Venoms are preserved, along with examples of the NF 3 and Swiss-built FB.50 and 54. In Sweden, two examples of the NF.51 are preserved. There are many survivors in Switzerland, and other Swiss aircraft are scattered throughout Europe. One such aircraft is preserved in the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim, although in the colours of the Iraqi Air Force. In Australia, a number of Sea Venom FAW.53s have also survived. Venezuela has the only complete surviving British-built single-seat Venom.

Polish Aviation Museum (PAL) has British-built Sea Venom, which was used for experiments at de Havilland and Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, and then was transferred to Imperial War Museum, which sold it to PAL in 2013.

Although the Venom was, for a time, a popular and cheap warbird the number of airworthy aircraft is dwindling. There are two in the UK and one in New Zealand that fly regularly. World Heritage Air Museum fleet owns 1 Venom (tail number N202DM) and operated an additional Venom (tail number N747J). N747J crashed on 20 July 2018, while preparing for the EAA AirVenture Show, killing the pilot, World Heritage Aviation Museum co-founder, Martin J. Tibbits. All are licence-built Swiss examples.

Biala is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as R. Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (II) was the great-grandson of R. Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (""the Yid HaKadosh"") (1766 - 1813), the first Peshischa Rebbe. The dynasty was originally spread throuhout many towns in Poland, often taking the names of said towns. However after the Holocaust, the name ""Biala"" become synonymous with the entire dynasty. Today the dynasty is mostly concentrated in Israel, America and Switzerland.

The Yid HaKadosh established the Peshischa shcool of Hasidic thought based out of Przysucha, Poland. He breached a rationalistic and talmudic-centric approach to Hasidism which stood in contrast to the kabbalistic and miracle based court of Lublin. After his death, he was succeeded by his disciple, R. Simcha Bunem Bonhardt (1765 - 1827), who went on to become one of the foremost figures in Polish Hasidism. 
 Grand Rabbi Yerachmiel Tzvi Rabinowicz (1784 - 1834) - Son of the Yid HaKadosh, he supported himself as a watch maker and is best known for defending R. Simcha Bunem, after an attempted was made by several Hasidic dignitaries to ban Peshischa Hasidism.

72,297,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type3,"SNOTEL is an automated system of snowpack and related climate sensors operated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture in the Western United States.

There are over 730 SNOTEL (or snow telemetry) sites in 11 states, including Alaska. The sites are generally located in remote high-mountain watersheds where access is often difficult or restricted. Access for maintenance by the NRCS includes various modes from hiking and skiing to helicopters.

All SNOTEL sites measure snow water content, accumulated precipitation, and air temperature.  Some sites also measure snow depth, soil moisture and temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.  These data are used to forecast yearly water supplies, predict floods, and for general climate research.

History
Installation of SNOTEL began in the mid-1960s.  Its use in climate forecasting was not originally envisioned, but it has become the standard climate data for western U.S. locations which are elevated sufficiently to have at least a seasonal snowpack.  Ongoing algorithm upgrades correct and backfill missing data, while improvements in communications improve the overall quality of data collection.

Meteor burst technology

SNOTEL uses meteor burst communications technology to collect and communicate data in near-real-time. VHF radio signals are reflected at a steep angle off the ever-present band of ionized meteors existing from about 50 to 75 miles (80 to 120 km) above the earth. Satellites are not involved; the NRCS operates and controls the entire system.

Sites are designed to operate unattended and without maintenance for a year. They are battery powered with solar cell recharge. The condition of each site is monitored daily when it reports on 8 operational functions. Serious problems or deteriorating performance trigger a response from the NRCS electronics technicians located in six data collection offices.

The SNOTEL sites are polled by 2 master stations operated by NRCS in Boise, Idaho, and Ogden, Utah. A central computer at the NRCS's National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) in Portland, Oregon controls system operations and receives the data collected by the SNOTEL network.

System capabilities

Basic SNOTEL sites have a pressure sensing snow pillow, storage precipitation gauge, and air temperature   sensor. However, they can accommodate 64 channels of data and will accept analog and parallel or serial digital sensors. On-site microprocessors provide functions such as computing daily maximum, minimum, and average temperature information. Generally, sensor data are recorded every 15 minutes and reported out in a daily poll of all sites. Special polls are conducted more frequently in response to specific needs.

The new generation of remote sites, master stations, and central computer facilities allows for hourly interrogation of remote sites. The system has the ability to vary the configuration of a remote site by transmitting the appropriate commands telling the remote site what sensors to turn on or what parameters to send.

A variety of calculations can be made on any sensor channel. For example, the user can select maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, or circular averaging.

Each sensor can be accessed independently at a specific interval. For example, wind speed may be sensed every minute during the day to arrive at an average, while the snow pillow may be accessed every 15 minutes for the accumulated total.

System performance has increased over the years, mainly due to a better understanding of meteor burst communication characteristics and improved equipment.  While a 95 percent response to a system-wide poll is the standard, over 99 percent is common.

Data storage, management and accessibility
All data are received by the SNOTEL central computer, which in turn is linked to the Centralized Forecasting System (CFS) in the NWCC where data can be accessed. Once on the CFS the data is kept in a relational database, where various analysis and graphics programs are available. Current and historical data and analyses are available by dialing into the CFS, by disk or tape media, paper copy, and on the Internet.

The anchor has been used as a symbol for Rhode Island since the colony's founding in 1636, well before the region claimed statehood.

History
Rhode Island was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a Christian minister, Anne Hutchinson, and others seeking religious freedom from persecution in Massachusetts and Europe. The seal's words and emblems were likely inspired by the biblical phrase ""hope we have as an anchor of the soul,"" found in Hebrews, Verse 6:18-19. After Roger Williams received an official charter in England in 1644, the word ""Hope"" was placed over the seal's anchor and still remains. The outer circle of the seal reads Seal of the State of Rhode Island 1636.

Besides the seal, Roger Williams also used Biblical virtues when he named Providence, Rhode Island, and the islands in Narragansett Bay: Prudence Island, Patience Island, Hope Island, and Despair Island.

Legal enactment
The seal has been adopted by successive Rhode Island government authorities since 1644.  The current (2021) General Laws enactment asserts:
§ 42-4-2  State seal. – There shall continue to be one seal for the public use of the state; the form of an anchor shall be engraved thereon; the motto thereof shall be the word ""Hope""; and in a circle around the outside shall be engraved with the words, ""Seal of the State of Rhode Island, 1636"".

The rats' lack of vasopressin was the result of a naturally occurring genetic mutation.

The rats were being raised for laboratory use by Dr. Henry A. Schroeder and technician Tim Vinton, who noticed that the litter of 17 drank and urinated excessively.  The researchers determined that the rats failed to produce vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone, and they gave the rats to Dartmouth Medical School (DMS).  Researchers there determined that the rats had a mutation in the gene that regulates the production of vasopressin.

The DMS researchers bred the rats for distribution to scientists around the world to use in testing the possible role of vasopressin in any given biological function.  The Brattleboro rat was an early and naturally occurring precursor of the knockout rat.

92,303,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type5,"Deoxyepinephrine, also known by the common names N-methyldopamine and epinine, is an organic compound and natural product that is structurally related to the important neurotransmitters dopamine and epinephrine. All three of these compounds also belong to the catecholamine family. The pharmacology of epinine largely resembles that of its ""parent"", dopamine. Epinine has been found in plants, insects and animals. It is also of significance as the active metabolic breakdown product of the prodrug ibopamine, which has been used to treat congestive heart failure.

Occurrence
Epinine does not seem to occur widely, but it is present as a minor alkaloid in some plants, such as the peyote cactus, Lophophora williamsii, and a species of Acacia, as well as in Scotch Broom, Cytisus scoparius. This compound has also been isolated from the adrenal medulla of pigs and cows, and from the toad, Bufo marinus. It has also been detected in the locust, Locusta migratoria.

Chemistry

Preparation
The first total synthesis of epinine was reported by Buck, who prepared it from 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine (""homoveratrylamine"") by first converting the latter to its Schiff base with benzaldehyde, then N-methylating this with methyl iodide; hydrolysis of the resulting product was followed by cleavage of the methyl ethers using hydriodic acid to furnish epinine. A very similar synthesis, differing only in the use of dimethyl sulfate for the N-methylation, and HBr for the O-demethylation, but providing more extensive experimental details, was published by Borgman in 1973.

An earlier semi-synthesis (so-called because it began with the natural product laudanosine) due to Pyman is incorrectly cited by Buck, and the error carried over to the entry for epinine (under the name deoxyepinephrine) in the Merck Index.

Common salts of epinine are: hydrochloride, C9H13NO2.HCl, m.p. 179-180 °C; sulfate, (C9H13NO2)2.H2SO4, m.p. 289-290 °C; hydrobromide, C9H13NO2.HBr, m.p. 165-166 °C.

Structure
The X-ray structure of epinine hydrobromide has been reported.

Pharmacology
One of the most prominent pharmacological characteristics of epinine, its ability to raise blood pressure, was noted as early as 1910, by Barger and Dale, who reported that ""methylamino-ethyl-catechol"", as they called it, had about 1/7 x the pressor potency of epinephrine, but about 5 x the potency of dopamine (""amino-ethyl-catechol"") in cat preparations. The Buroughs Wellcome Co., for which Barger, Dale and Pyman (see ""Chemistry"" section) worked, subsequently marketed the hydrochloride salt of ""methylamino-ethyl-catechol"", under the name ""epinine"", as a substitute for epinephrine. Tainter further quantified the pressor activity of epinine in atropine-treated and anesthetized intact cats, showing that doses of 0.02-0.2 mg, given i.v., were about 1/12 as active as l-epinephrine, but that the effect lasted about twice as long (~ 3 minutes), and was accompanied by an increase in pulse rate.

Eventually, epinine was determined to be a non-selective stimulant of dopamine (DA) receptors, α-, and β-adrenoceptors, with the stimulation of D2 receptors leading to inhibition of noradrenergic and ganglionic neurotransmission. These studies, conducted using anesthetized animals, were amplified by van Woerkens and co-workers, who compared the effects of epinine and dopamine in unanesthetized pigs, so as to avoid any possible influences of an anesthetic. Drug doses were in the range of 1-10 μg/kg/min, administered by i.v. infusion over a period of 10 minutes. The results of these experiments showed that, in pigs, over the dose-range employed, epinine was more potent than dopamine as an agonist on D2, α-, and β2-receptors, but was weaker than dopamine as a D1-agonist. The β1-agonist effect of both compounds was weak or non-existent.

Comparable studies, in which blood pressure, heart rate and serum prolactin levels were measured after the administration of 0.5-4 μg/kg/min of epinine by i.v. infusion over a 15-minute period to healthy humans, were reported subsequently by Daul and co-workers. These investigators found that at lower doses (0.5 or 1.0 μg/kg/min), which produced plasma concentrations of 20-80 nM/L, epinine, in common with dopamine, caused a fall in prolactin level, but did not affect blood pressure or heart rate. At higher doses (2.0 or 4.0 μg/kg/min), epinine significantly increased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate. In contrast, dopamine caused an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate only.
Both drugs increased diuresis and natriuresis - effects that are thought to be due to the activation of renal D1 receptors.
It was concluded that at the lower doses, epinine and dopamine exerted their effects only at DA (D2) receptors, but did not activate α- or β-adrenoceptors. At the higher doses, epinine activated α-, β1- and β2-receptors to about the same extent, whereas dopamine showed only a mild stimulation of β1-receptors, without any effects on α- or β2-receptors. Additionally, it was observed that the effects of epinine were largely due to its direct action on receptors, while dopamine also produced some of its effects indirectly, by stimulating norepinephrine release.

Toxicity
LD50 for HCl salt: 212 mg/kg (mouse; i.p.). For comparison, it might be noted that dopamine has a LD50 of 1978 mg/kg under the same conditions.

50,304,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type2,"The white perch (Morone americana) is not a true perch but is a fish of the temperate bass family, Moronidae, notable as a food and game fish in eastern North America. In some places it is referred to as ""Silver Bass"".

The name ""White perch"" is sometimes applied to the white crappie.

Generally silvery-white in color, hence the name, depending upon habitat and size specimens have begun to develop a darker shade near the dorsal fin and along the top of the fish. This sometimes earns them the nickname ""black-back"". White perch have been reported up to  in length and weighing .

Although favoring brackish waters, it is also found in fresh water and coastal areas from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario south to the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, and as far east as Nova Scotia.
They are also found in the lower Great Lakes, Finger Lakes, Long Island Sound and nearby coastal areas, Hudson and Mohawk River system, Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay. It is also found occasionally in small land-locked lakes and ponds. The raw meat is of a somewhat pinkish hue, but when cooked, it is white and flaky. At times, a parasite known as Lironeca ovalis is located in the gills. They are only known to reduce the growing rate of white perch.

Diet
White perch are known to eat the eggs of many species native to the Great Lakes, such as walleye and other true perches. At times, fish eggs are 100% of their diet. They prefer to eat small minnows like mud minnows and fathead minnows. In the Chesapeake Bay, white perch commonly prey upon grass shrimp, razor clams, and bloodworms which are all common to the region.

Reproduction
White perch are a prolific species. The female can deposit over 150,000 eggs in a spawning session, lasting just over a week. Several males will often attend a spawning female, and each may fertilize a portion of her eggs. The young hatch within one to six days of fertilization. 

The white perch is currently recovering from a loss of population in the Hudson River.

Aquatic nuisance species
Some states consider the white perch to be a nuisance species due to its ability to destroy fisheries. They have been associated with the declines in both walleye and white bass populations because they feed heavily on baitfish used by those species and outcompete them for food and space. Many states have enacted laws forbidding possession of live white perch. Additionally, these states recommend not releasing captured white perch back into the water to help control its spread.

62,305,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type8,"Theological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God.  Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named Faith, Hope, and Charity (Love), and can trace their importance in Christian theology to Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13, who also pointed out that “the greatest of these is love.”

The medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues ""because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures"".

Background

1 Corinthians 13
The first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in St. Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, ""...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope..."" In 1 Thessalonians 5:8, he refers to this triad of virtues again, ""But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation.""

In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). ""So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."" First, because it informs the other two: ""It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."" According to Augustine of Hippo, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while ""Hope isn't hope if its object is seen"", and faith gives way to possession. This view is shared by Gregory of Nyssa.

Aquinas
Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (prudentia) and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed ""the Unity of the Virtues.""

Aquinas stated that theological virtues are so called ""because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures"".

In his treatment of the virtues, Aquinas viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.

Aquinas says ""Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found"". (De Veritate, xiv, 8)

Aquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.

Teaching by denomination

Catholic Church
The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that faith, hope and love ""dispose Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity.""

Moravian Church
Among essential beliefs, the Moravian Church teaches that ""God creates; God redeems; God blesses. And we respond in faith, in love and in hope."" As such, Moravian Christians teach to judge themselves ""by how deep our faith is, how expansive our love is, and how life affirming our hope is.""

Anglican Communion
Churches of the Anglican Communion also follow Augustine and Aquinas. ""Faith is a matter of knowledge of God which perfects the intellect...Hope is a matter of the perfection of the will...Love is a matter of perfection itself as love is the perfection of all powers."" Richard Hooker said regarding faith, that its'principal object is that eternal verity which hath discovered the treasures of hidden wisdom in Christ'; of hope that its 'highest object is that everlasting goodness which in Christ doth quicken the dead'; of charity, that its 'final object is that incomprehensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of Christ the Son of the Living God'.(Ecclesiastical Polity, bk.i, chap. xi)

Moral theology 

A person receives the theological virtues by their being ""infused""—through Divine grace—into the person. The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being (theos).
 Faith is the infused virtue, by which the intellect, by a movement of the will, assents to the supernatural truths of Revelation, not on the motive of intrinsic evidence, but on the sole ground of the infallible authority of God revealing. According to Hugh Pope ""[W]hat God says is supremely credible, though not necessarily supremely intelligible for us."" The First Vatican Council (III, iii;) stated that ""faith is a supernatural virtue by which we with the inspiration and assistance of God's grace, believe those things to be true which He has revealed...although the assent of faith is in no sense blind, yet no one can assent to the Gospel teaching in the way necessary for salvation without the illumination of the Holy Spirit..."" It is a gratuitous gift of God.
 Hope is defined as a Divinely infused virtue, acts upon the will, by which one trusts, with confidence grounded on the Divine assistance, to attain life everlasting. Its opposite is the sin of despair.
 Charity is a Divinely infused virtue, inclining the human will to cherish God for his own sake above all things, and man for the sake of God. To love God is to wish Him all honour and glory and every good, and to endeavour, as far as one can, to obtain it for Him. John 14:23 notes a unique feature of reciprocity which makes charity a veritable friendship of man with God. ""Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."" Lack of love may give place to hatred, wrath or indifference.

Comparison of Cardinal and Theological Virtues
The moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the cardinal virtues in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. The Episcopal Church shares this view. ""As distinct from the cardinal virtues which we can develop, the theological virtues are the perfection of human powers given by the grace of God."" Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.

Following St. Augustine, Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of gluttony. The infused virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.

Pope Benedict XVI wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: Deus caritas est (about love), Spe salvi (about hope), and Lumen fidei (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by Pope Francis).

VirtueShinehead (born Edmund Carl Aiken; 10 April 1962 in Kent, England) is an English-born; The Bronx, New York, raised; Jamaican reggae singer/toaster/rapper.

Career
He began his music career by performing for different New York City reggae dancehall sound systems in the 1980s, most notably Tony Screw's Downbeat the Ruler, based in The Bronx.

His recording debut was in 1986 on the African Love Music independent record label with ""Who the Cap Fits (Let Them Wear It)"" from the album Rough & Rugged. In his early years, Jeff Buckley led his group on guitar and lent a hand with backing vocals. He appeared on Sly and Robbie's 1987 album, Rhythm Killers.

Shinehead was signed to a recording contract by A&R representative Raoul Roach with Elektra Records in 1988, and remained with the label until 1995.

His best-known single is the cover version of Sting's ""Englishman in New York"", retitled as ""Jamaican in New York"" (1993). It reached No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1993. The single featured on the Sidewalk University album.

He is largely credited as being one of the original acts to cross hip-hop with reggae music, now known as reggae fusion, with songs such as ""Try My Love"" in 1992. Shinehead's vocal talent can be heard across various tracks on the Unity (1988) and The Real Rock (1990) albums.  His rapid deejay chat style can be heard on tracks such as ""Cigarette Breath"", ""Gimme No Crack"" and ""Do It with Ease"".  Shinehead's melodic, singjay approach is present in songs such as ""Strive"", while he brings more hip hop flavor in tracks including ""Chain Gang"".  ""Chain Gang"" was the first video to be shown during a regular season episode of Yo! MTV Raps, in 1988.

Shinehead is still active. He was part of the yearly Jamrock cruise in 2015. The same year, he played at the CES in Las Vegas. He has had success with his sound system, Kingston 12.

It starred Mithun Chakraborty, with Nirmal Pandey, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Raza Murad, Roshni, and Archana. As he had in Jallaad, Mithun again played both a positive and a negative role in this film.

Plot
The film begins as Kalishankar (Mithun Chakraborty), a notorious international gangster, runs away from jail. His gang members, Mazditta (Raza Murad) and the mentally challenged Rudra (Nirmal Pandey) are working with him. The case is handed to police officer Inspector Pandey (Vishwajeet Pradhan), but his plans to catch Kali fail every time. The DSP (Tej Sapru) orders the inspector to encounter Kali wherever he sees him. One day he prepares for the encounter with the entire police team. Suddenly the DSP arrives and stops everything. He says that he is not Kali, but a CBI officer named Ravi Verma who was actually Kali's body double and is pretending to be Kali these days.

Verma (also Mithun Chakraborty) is a sincere person who is leading a simple life with his widowed mother, his wife Rajani (Archana), his son Bunty and his sister Jinal (Roshini). Kali wants to take revenge on Verma since he had caused Kali major losses. He tries to kill him one day when Verma goes to a national park with his family. When Kali shoots at him, the shot misses and kills Bunty. Verma then starts investigating the murder. One day, Verma is sitting near his son's grave when suddenly Kali arrives and tries to kill him. Kali informs Verma that he was aiming at him but missed and killed his son. Verma shoots Kali, leaving him in a coma. 

Afterward, DSP tells Verma that his face is very similar to Kali's and asks him to go to America and catch Kali's gang. Verma impersonates Kali and goes to America. Kali then awakens from the coma, impersonates Verma and takes up his life. As the DSP, goes for his morning walk he sees Kali but thinks he sees Verma, and Kali kills him. After that, Kali goes to Verma's home and tries to molest Verma's sister and wife. After many days, Kali speaks with Verma on the phone and tells him that he has taken his place. At that moment, Verma's mother hears everything. She tells Kali that she knows he is not Verma, Kali pushes her down the stairs, killing her, and then escapes. 

Verma rushes back to India. At his mother's funeral, Kali and Mazditta capture Verma and his family. Verma then eliminates the gang, leaving only Kali, his girlfriend Julie, and Rudra. Kali tries to take Verma's sister and his wife. Varma confronts, confusing Rajini and Jinal. Ravi tries to convince them that he is Kali but Rudra blackmails him not to tell the truth otherwise he will kill them both. Julie takes both of them and confines them in a room and she tries to kill Verma, but Verma kills her insead. Rudra comes to kill him but Verma kills him, too. Kali and Verma fight and Verma kills him, saving his family.

Biography 
Anne Pérard was born on 12 December 1743 in Charleville, France to Etienne Pérard, a lawyer in Parliament, and Jeanne Pierdhouy.

Anne Pérard's book, A Historical Praise of Anne de Montmorency (1783) was published with the author listed under the pen name Mlle. de Chateauregnault, and it was praised by the Academy of La Rochelle. The book presented a quick picture of events that took place from the reign of King Charles VIII to the battle of St. Denis. In a published review, Abbot Sabatier de Castres, a friend of the author, said of the book, ""this is a piece of our best written story that is known.""

Pérard was included in the Historical Dictionary, literary and bibliographic of Fortunée Lighter (1804), which mentioned 526 women of talent who lived between the sixth century and the start of the 19th century.

She was recognized as one of the rare female literary historians of her century in France. Her contemporaries included Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis (1746–1830) as well as the Benedictine nun and mystic Marie-Jacqueline Bouette de Blémur and the prioress Françoise-Madeleine de Chaugy, who were both well regarded as writers and chroniclers of French history.

According to Worldcat.org, Pérard's work appears in 11 publications in French and English.

After retiring to Senlis in northern France, Pérard died in 1829 at age 85.

93,310,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type2,"Terne plate is a form of tinplate: a thin steel sheet coated with an alloy of lead and tin. The terne alloy was in the ratio of 10-20% tin and the remainder lead. The low tin content made it cheaper than other tinplates.

Terne plate was used for tinsmithed sheet metal goods, such as storage vessels, jugs and funnels, particularly for industrial use with flammable liquids. Unlike tinplate, it was not used for long-term storage or around food items, owing to the high lead content.  Terne plate has also been used for roofing, as a cheaper alternative to zinc or lead.

Until 2012 lead had been replaced with the metal zinc and was used in the ratio of 50% tin and 50% zinc. This alloy had a low melting point of approximately 360 degrees Fahrenheit but is no longer available. Today terne coated metal is coated with 99.9% tin, instead of hot-dipping, a more consistent galvanic deposition process is applied. Additionally the substrate has been changed from steel to stainless steel, benefitting from the corrosion resistance of stainless steel alloys. The pure tin alloy makes soldering easier, as the melting point is homogenised and doesn't need to match the melting point of two metals with different melting temperatures.

Use

Terne was historically used to coat sheet steel to inhibit corrosion. It was one of the cheapest alloys suitable for this, and the tin content was kept at a minimum while still adhering to a hot-dipped iron sheet, to minimize the cost.

Historical terne metal must be painted. If the paint is maintained, terne metal can last 90 years or more. Terne coated stainless steel (TCS II or Roofinox) or copper is commonly used to replace terne metal roofs as either material will outlast terne metal. Terne coated stainless steel roofing can last 100 years or more unpainted, copper roofing can last 50 years or more unpainted.

Terne II used zinc in place of lead for environmental reasons.  Today's main reason and benefit of the tin coating is its aesthetic behavior. Tin develops a natural matte grey patina when exposed to the elements. The result of the weathering process depends on the environment and climate conditions present. Depending on the environment and atmospheric conditions different substrate alloys are used. The stainless steel alloy 439 is ferritic and is used for normal environments; for coastal applications, the austenitic stainless steel alloy 316L is used providing an increased corrosion resistance to chlorides.

Terminology
The term ""terne"" is derived from the French word for ""dull"" and was probably in reference to its dull appearance in comparison to the shiny surface of tinplate.

Terne-coated steel is also known as terne-metal and often referred to as ""tin"" (see the Slate Roof Bible). Traditional terne-coated steel cannot be purchased anymore, it had been replaced by a terne coated stainless steel product (Roofinox tin-plated (Terne)), available at most roofing supply stores.

6,311,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type3,"Vaeakau-Taumako (formerly known as Pileni) is a Polynesian language spoken in some of the Reef Islands as well as in the Taumako Islands (also known as the Duff Islands) in the Temotu province of the Solomon Islands.

The language is spoken throughout the Taumako Islands, while in the Reef Islands, it is spoken on Aua, Matema, Nifiloli, Nupani, Nukapu, and Pileni. Speakers are thought to be descendants of people from Tuvalu.

Vaeakau-Taumako was described by linguists Even Hovdhaugen and Åshild Næss, in the form of a dictionary and a grammar.

Classification
Vaeakau-Taumako is a Polynesian outlier. Within that group, it has traditionally been considered one of the Futunic branch, but a 2008 study (exclusively based on lexical evidence) concluded that this membership is weakly supported.

Phonology

Vowels

Vaeakau-Taumako does not vary from the standard Polynesian and Austronesian vowel system, featuring five vowels that can be used either in a long or short form. Short vowels found in word-final syllables are frequently devoiced or dropped, but long vowels in the same position are always stressed. There is little allophonic variation between vowel pronunciations.

Vowel sequences in Vaeakau-Taumako are typically not treated as diphthongs, as they are not fully reduplicated, as shown in the word ""holauhola"". This is despite the vowels in the original word being pronounced like a diphthong.

Consonants

The Vaeakau-Taumako language has one of the most complex consonant system of the Polynesian languages, with 19 distinct phonemes, plus a large amount of variation across dialects. /b/ and /d/ are found primarily in loan words, rather being native to the language.

Aspirated sounds are characteristic of the language, and are typically strong and audible. However, the use of aspirated sounds varies across dialects, enough that it is difficult to identify a consistent pattern aside from noting they always occur at the start of stressed syllables.

Morphology

Pronouns
Vaeakau-Taumako pronouns distinguish between 1st, 2nd and 3rd person pronouns. There are some inclusive and exclusive distinctions, and variations for singular, dual and plural in all cases. There are no gender distinctions. There is variation in the pronoun system for the dialects of Vaeakau-Taumako which can become quite complex, so for simplicity, only the general forms are recorded here.

Independent personal pronouns
There are two distinctive base sets of independent personal pronouns in Vaeakau-Taumako. The standard forms are used for formal occasions and recorded text, while the colloquial forms are typically found in informal, everyday conversation.

Bound subject pronouns
The language also features bound subject pronouns which act as clitics to the tense-aspect-mood marker of the verb of the constituent. They are not obligatory to use. The presence of the ""u"" has free variation by the choice of the speaker, but they are typically less prevalent in the colloquial forms.

Hortative pronouns
The dual, plural and 2nd person singular have specific pronouns used in imperative and hortative sentences.

Emphatic corefential pronouns
When the subject and direct object of a sentence are the same thing, repetition of the independent pronoun in place of both argument positions is typically used. However, there is a set of emphatic coreferential pronouns used for the direct object to refer to someone or a group of people acting alone.

The general pronoun nga
The word nga functions as a pronoun with specific use. It is a third person pronoun, but lacks specification for number, and is used to refer to both singular and plural referents. It typically is an anaphoric reference to a previously mentioned referent.

Possession

Control 
While it is common for Polynesian languages to distinguish between alienability and inalienability with a and o possessives, this is not the case for Vaeakau-Taumako. This distinction exists, however it instead marks control – not of the possessed item itself, but of the possessive relationship.

A-possessives 
Relationships that can be initiated or terminated freely, such as items that can be bought, sold or given away at will are marked with the a-possessive.

O-possessives 
Relationships that are outside of the possessor's personal control, such as body parts and kinship relationships are marked with o-possessives.

Alienability and inalienability 
Instead of a- and o- possessives, alienability and inalienability in Vaeakau-Taumako are distinguished by the use of either prenominal or postnominal possessive pronouns.

Prenominal possessive pronouns 
Prenominal possessive pronouns occur directly preceding the possessed nouns, and are typically used for inalienable relationships, such as kinship terms and body parts. Prenominal possessive pronouns distinguish between singular, dual and plural of the possessor. The singular possessive forms make an additional distinction between singular and plural of the possessed entity, and encode the a- or o-possessive directly. The dual and plural possessor forms are combined with the possessive prepositions a and o to express this distinction, or they may occur without a preposition.

Postnominal possessive pronouns 
The postnominal possessive pronoun succeeds the possessed noun, and are used to mark alienable relationships, such as owned items. They make no distinction between singular and plural of the possessed item, instead the distinction is usually made through the choice of article preceding the possessed noun. Like with prenominal possessive pronouns, the postnominal possessives are based on the possessive prepositions a and o, plus a pronominal form indicating person and number of the possessor. In the singular form, this is the same set of suffixes found on the prenominal possessives, whereas in the dual and plural form, a distinct set of person and number forms are found. In the third and first person, these forms are identical to the independent personal pronouns, except for the lack of aspiration on the initial consonant.

Possessive Suffixes 
The possessive suffixes -ku  (1st person), -u (2nd person) and -na (3rd person) apply to a restricted set of kinship nouns: tama/mha 'father', hina 'mother', thoka 'same-sex sibling', thupu 'grandparent', and mokupu 'grandchild'. These nouns cannot occur without possessive marking, they require either a possessive suffix or, in the dual and plural, a postnominal possessive pronoun. An alternative construction is for these nouns to take the 3rd person possessive suffix -na in combination with a prenominal possessive pronoun or possessive prepositional phrase. The form in -na must in such cases be understood as a neutral or unmarked form, since it may combine with a pronoun of any person and number; but a form in -na without any further possessive marking is unambiguously 3rd person. Nouns other than those previously mentioned do not take possessive suffixes, but instead combine with possessive pronouns.

Negation

Vaeako-Taumako displays negation in prohibitions (prohibitive, irrealis, imperfective, admonitive), statements (verbal and non-verbal) polar questions and noun phrases. Negation morphemes behave similarly to verbs in many respects although they do not take tense-aspect-mood markers or form independent predicates. However, there are instances of their taking complement clauses and for this reason negation morphemes might be considered a sub-class of verb.

Prohibition 

Prohibitive clauses may be divided into two. Prohibitive auā, (equal to the English 'don't') and Admonitive na. Prohibitives pattern themselves in similar ways and are most frequently positioned cause initially. Admonitives behave and distribute slightly differently as will be illustrated below.

Negated clauses appear with only a small range of tense-aspect-mood markers. Prohibitive clauses often display no tense-aspect-mood marker at all, if they do, the markers are either na irrealis or me prescriptive. Negated declarative clauses typically occur with either perfective ne or imperfective no, with other options only marginally represented in collected data.

Prohibitive auā 

auā appears clause-initially, however discourse particles such as nahilā ('take care, make sure') may precede it. Other grammatical morphemes such as articles or markers of tense, aspect or mood may not precede it which excludes auā from the verb category of Vaeakao-Taumako.

However, auā behaves like a verb in that it may take clausal complements, which are then often either nominalised or the irrealis marker na is present (see table 1.1.3).
A correlation exists between singular 2nd person subject and a nominalised clause although this correlation is not absolute.

Contrasting this, the 2nd person dual or plural subjects attract the irrealis marker na to create a prohibitive clause.

Within data sets of Næss, A., & Hovdhaugen, E. (2011), as implied by the imperative nature of the morpheme, auā  will tend to appear with 2nd person subjects as above, although both 1st and 3rd subjects are also found.

1st Person

3rd Person

Auā  is also found in conjunction with modifiers such as ala which marks a hypothetical or oki, 'back, again'.

auā-ala

auā - oki

Irrealis na and Imperfective no 

Irrealis na and imperfective no adheres to a common pattern of appearing in 2nd person in dual or plural within prohibitive clause structure.

Instances of 3rd person are less frequent and tend to include the imperfective no in postposition to morpheme auā.

Admonitive na 
na behaves similarly to aluā only in that it is clause initial, it is otherwise classified as a clause initial particle and it must be accompanied by the tense-aspect-mood marker me  which acts as a prescriptive.

However na also has a second function, it acts to point out the consequences of disobeying the order. In this role the na often appears without me, creating a clause without tense-aspect-mood marking.

Statements

Verbal Clause Negation 

Verbal negation is made up of three morphemes which act independently and may be understood as the English equivalents to siai 'not', sikiai 'not yet',and hiekh 'not at all'.

siai 'not, no' 

According to Næss, A., & Hovdhaugen, E. (2011) the colloquial pronunciation of  siai is hiai, however the standard written form is siai. 
Siai comes after preverbal arguments but is placed before the tense-aspect-mood particle and following clitic pronoun.

	

As in the case of auā modifying particles, which are traditionally found after verbs, may appear following siai. An example of this is loa which is an emphatic marker.

For example, siai loa.

A further example is the addition of po which generally serves to connect a complement clause.

sikiai, hikiai 'not yet' 

sikiai, hikiai (where sikiai is the formal written expression of spoken hikiai) appears in the same formation as above siai except it proceeds the preverbal argument and precedes any tense-aspect-mood markers. It appears less frequently and is often accompanied by the perfective marker ne.

hiekhī/hiekhiē 'not at all' 

This is the emphatic form of the negator. It follows the same distribution as both sia and sikiai and is often accompanied by the post-nuclear modifier loa.

As with siai  hiekhī appears in conjunction with complementiser po, although with lower frequency.

Non-verbal Clause Negation 

The same negators are used as in the verbal clauses above.

Questions

Polar Questions 

Polar questions are commonly formed in three ways. A declarative clause with a rise in intonation to mark the interrogative which requires the binary, 'yes' or 'no' response, much as they are in English may be used. The second alternative is the addition of the verbal negator (o) siai ‘(or) not'  and the third is the addition of verbal negator sikiai (not yet) if the interrogative has a temporal element.

Simple interrogative formed with declarative clause:

(o) siai

sikiai

Noun Phrase Negation

Negated Existence 

Non-specific article e can be used to express 'negated existence' unless the noun has a possessive marker in which case e is absent.

Spatial Deixis 
Spatial deixis is primarily expressed through demonstratives and directional forms in Vaeakau-Taumako. These spatial-deictic forms ""allow the speaker to point to spatial locations"" and encode the context of utterances or speech events. Interestingly, demonstrative and directional usage in Vaeakau-Taumako is particularly unique for a Polynesian language. This illustrates that spatial deixis is an especially important feature of Vaeakau-Taumako grammar. Demonstratives and directionals are discussed in more detail below.

Demonstratives 
Vaeakau-Taumako demonstratives comprise a three-term system which is summarised below:

Overall, these demonstratives have not only nominal and adverbial uses, but are also used in various capacities to structure discourse. The demonstrative particles also occur in more complex forms (see verbal demonstratives and deictic adverbs below).

Historical context 
Vaeakau-Taumako demonstratives have cognates in other Polynesian languages. These demonstratives are also consistent with what has been reconstructed for Proto-Polynesian and Proto-Oceanic. These linguistic reconstructions are summarised below: 

Furthermore, in the following discussion it will become evident that Boumma Fijian shares multiple linguistic traits with Vaeakau-Taumako. Therefore, it is possible that Boumma Fijian may be more closely related to Vaeakau-Taumako than other Polynesian languages.

Speaker-based system 
The Vaeakau-Taumako demonstrative system is speaker-based: the location of the hearer or speaker serves as reference point for where the relevant object is located. Denny summarised this succinctly in describing this system as one that centers space on the speaker or other participant. In Vaeakau-Taumako, 'ne(i)’ reflects an object’s proximity to the speaker, 'na' reflects an object’s proximity to the hearer and 'la' reflects distance from both the speaker and hearer, or a third party in the conversation.

This three-way distinction is so common in Oceanic languages that it is ""virtually certain"" that Proto-Oceanic also adopted a person-based demonstrative system. On a global scale, this three-way contrast is the second most common demonstrative system in the languages listed on The World Atlas of Linguistic Structures(WALS), with a two-way contrast being the most common system.

Vaeakau-Taumako's speaker-based system can be rationalised by the geographic context in which it is spoken. As the language is spoken on islands in the Solomon Islands, the speakers inhabit relatively small environments that do not have naturally defined reference points to describe space. To compensate for this, demonstratives are instead based on the speakers and hearers who are in the ""immediate speech situation"".

Distance-based system 
However, discourse analyses of current demonstrative usage indicates that the system may be shifting to one that is distance-based and therefore not dependent on the speech-act participants. This is summarised below:

'Na' is generally the preferred neutral choice of demonstrative to refer to an object that is neither far nor close. Therefore 'na' is not only used in direct conversations to illustrate proximity with a speech-participant (e.g. 'that one near you'), but it is also used in narratives as a medial term of a distance-based system. In these narrative contexts, 'na' refers to an object that is distance-neutral or medium-distance. This dual purpose of 'na' is not completely unique to Vaeakau-Taumako as Boumaa Fijian also adopts a ""mixed"" system.

Demonstrative pronouns 
Demonstratives in Vaeakau-Taumako can be used as heads of noun phrases that are comparable to the English phrases 'this one' and 'that one'. In this capacity, the demonstrative is often preceded by the articles 'te' (indicating singularity) or 'ngha' (indicating plurality). This is typical for a Polynesian language. The following example shows the demonstrative 'na' ('that'), being used in conjunction with the prefix 'te' to denote singularity:

 
Furthermore the following example shows the prefix 'ngha' attaching to the demonstrative 'la' ('those') to indicate plurality: 

Alternatively, the demonstratives can occur as a free-standing lexical item (i.e. without the need for preceding articles). This more unique aspect of Vaeakau-Taumako is exemplified in the following clause:

When acting as heads of nouns, the demonstratives may also be used anaphorically to refer to previously mentioned objects/participants in the conversation. The demonstratives can therefore serve the same purpose as a third-person pronoun (see Figure 4.4 below). Cross-linguistically this is not common, with the 100 of the 225 languages on WALS having language systems where third person pronouns are unrelated to demonstratives.

Demonstrative adjective 
Demonstratives also function to modify a noun phrase in Vaeakau-Taumako. They can be used with nouns or pronouns and can function as a deictic or anaphoric reference. The following example shows how the demonstrative 'na' ('that') is suffixed to the noun 'mhe' ('man') for a deictic purpose: 

This second example shows how the demonstrative 'ne' can be used as an anaphoric reference:

When a demonstrative is used with a pronoun, the demonstrative often (but not always) corresponds with the speech-act participant that is being referred to in the respective pronoun. Therefore 'ne' will be generally used with first person pronouns, 'na' will be used with second person pronouns and 'la' will be used with third person pronouns. However, 'na' can also be adopted as a neutral particle that is used interchangeably with third person and second person pronouns.

Local adverbial demonstratives 
Demonstratives in Vaeakau-Taumako also function as local adverbs that modify a verb and indicate the location in which the respective action occurs:

When being used in this adverbial capacity, the demonstratives also have temporal-deictic references to refer to time (i.e. 'now' and 'then'):

Verbal demonstratives 
In Vaeakau-Taumako, the formal class of adverbs is limited, so manner adverbial demonstratives with the meanings 'do/be like this, do/be like that' are regularly utilised. These verbal demonstratives are cross-linguistically rare, however Boumaa Fijian and Dyirbal also exhibit similar forms. For example, in Fijian 'eneii' functions like the verbal demonstratives in Vaeakau-Taumako. The Vaeakau-Taumako forms are created by attaching the prefix 'p(h)e' to the core demonstrative particles:

This first example shows the adverbial demonstrative 'phe-ne' being used to convey the meaning 'do like this':

Secondly, verbal demonstratives also function to mean 'be the same as, in the same way':

Thirdly, the verbal demonstratives can function as modifiers of nouns to mean 'an X like that' (Figure 7.4) or 'a certain X' (Figure 7.5):

This complex three-way distinction in which verbal demonstratives can be used is not only uncommon cross-linguistically, but it is also atypical among the languages which do have similar verbal demonstrative systems. Dyirbal and Boumaa Fijian only adopt a single verb to denote 'do it like this' in comparison to Vaeakau-Taumako's three-way system.

Deictic adverbs 
Vaeakau-Taumako also has deictic adverbs that are formed by applying the prefixes 'a-’, 'i-'or 'e-’ to the core demonstrative particles. These forms are summarised below:

It is worth noting that 'ena' ('somewhere there') appears to only have a spatial reference. Furthermore the usage of 'ena' seems restricted to colloquial contexts:

Demonstratives in discourse   
Demonstrative particles commonly occur at the end of phrases. This applies to a variety of phrase types, with the following examples illustrating how 'na' can occur phrase-finally in a noun phrase (Figure 9.1), a verb phrase (Figure 9.2) and an adverbial phrase (Figure 9.3):

Beyond deictic and anaphoric uses of demonstratives (which have been discussed above), another core use of demonstratives is for phrase demarcation. Demonstratives occur at the end of a phrase as a means of marking the phrase boundary and situating the phrase within the overarching context of the clause. In Vaeakau-Taumako, demonstratives are commonly used to indicate that there is a link between the demonstrative-marked phrase and the succeeding speech. It is often used in conjunction with rising intonation to indicate that ""more is coming"" (Figure 9.4 below). Similar demarcative particle morphemes are used in the Outlier East Futuna with the particle 'la'.

Directionals 
In addition to demonstratives, Vaeakau-Taumako also has a set of morphemes that indicate verbal deixis (i.e. the physical or metaphorical direction in which an action is being carried out). There are six morphemes which can be divided into two categories (Figure 1.1 and 1.2). The directionals are best described as verbs that are most commonly used as part of a verbal nucleus, following one or more verbs. The first category of Vaeakau-Taumako directionals is summarised below:

The following example shows 'mai' ('towards speaker') following another verb and marking the direction in space in which the act is occurring (i.e. towards the speech-act participants):

The second category of directionals is summarised below:

The following examples show 'iho' ('down') and 'oho' ('up or down') following another verb and marking the vertical direction in which the respective verb occurs:

Independent usage 
Directionals may also be used as independent verbs, with 'iho' and 'oho' being the most commonly used forms. When used as independent verbs, 'iho' means 'go down' (Figure 2.1) and 'oho' means 'move vertically; rise up; go down' (Figure 2.2):

Furthermore 'mai' can function as an independent verb to mean 'come' (Figure 2.3). This commonly occurs in imperative clauses, which is typically how cognates of 'mai' in related Polynesian languages are also used.

It is also interesting to note that 'mai' can not only encode a literal direction, but also a metaphorical 'social' direction. In the example below (Figure 2.4), 'mai' denotes 'towards me' in a metaphorical sense that is 'for me; for my benefit; on my behalf': 

Lastly 'atu' also functions an independent verb which means 'move out, go away'. This is shown in the below example (note: 'poi' is a prenuclear modifier that precedes verbs):

Historical context 
Vaeakau-Taumako directionals have cognates in most other Polynesian and Oceanic languages. The corresponding reconstructed forms in Proto-Oceanic were directional verbs that occurred either independently or in serialisation constructions with another verb. The reflexes of these forms occur in modern Oceanic languages in variety of formal word classes. For example, in Tuvaluan, 'mai' ('hither'), 'atu' ('thither'), 'aka' ('up') and 'ifo' ('down') have been classified as adverbs, while directionals are categorised as 'particles' in Somoan.

The play was performed on Broadway in 1959.

Plot
In an English household, the father dreams of giving up his job selling insurance to run an apple orchard, the mother dreams of him giving up his dreams, and the two children have problems of their own .

Adaptations
The play was adapted for British television in 1963.

1963 Australian TV adaptation

It was filmed for Australian TV in 1963, directed by Colin Dean and starring Grant Taylor, Peter Adams, Don Pascoe, Elizabeth Ferris, Margo Lee, Frank Taylor and Rosalind Seagrave.

It was the first drama to be simultaneously presented in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne via coaxial cable.

Plot
A man abandons his life as a clerk to start an orchard. His dreams of fulfilment are linked to his memories of growing up in Somerset. 

His wife decides to leave him.

Cast
Grant Taylor as Mr Cherry
Margo Lee as Isobel Cherry, his wife
Rosalind Seagrave as Taylor's daughter Judy
Peter Adams as Taylor's son Tom
Frank Taylor
Elizabeth Ferris
Don Pascoe

Production
The production was filmed in Sydney. 

At the time Grant Taylor was appearing on stage with Googie Withers in Woman in a Dressing Gown. 

Elizabeth Ferris who made her acting debut was a diving champion whose name was linked romantically to Murray Rose.

Reception
The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought ""Grant Taylor was well in command"" of his role but that Colin Dean's production ""was rather too crowded.""

Val Marshall of the Sunday edition of the same paper called it ""a first rate production"" in which Taylor and Lee were ""brilliant"".

The Bulletin wrote that ""Given a stronger plot, livelier dialogue,   less   stagey   sets,   more imaginative  cameras, some television   actors,   and  better   make-up,   it   could   have   been   a  good   play.   Lacking   them,   it   was   still tolerable,   because   the   viewer   could   feel  that   at   least   everyone   was   trying,   and that   is   not   a   bad   beginning   for   ABC  drama   production   in   1963.""

Moths described in 1889The carbon–fluorine bond is a polar covalent bond between carbon and fluorine that is a component of all organofluorine compounds. It is one of the strongest single bonds in chemistry—behind the B-F single bond, Si-F single bond and the H-F single bond, and relatively short—due to its partial ionic character. The bond also strengthens and shortens as more fluorines are added to the same carbon on a chemical compound. As such, fluoroalkanes like tetrafluoromethane (carbon tetrafluoride) are some of the most unreactive organic compounds.

Electronegativity and bond strength 
The high electronegativity of fluorine (4.0 for fluorine vs. 2.5 for carbon) gives the carbon–fluorine bond a significant polarity/dipole moment. The electron density is concentrated around the fluorine, leaving the carbon relatively electron poor. This introduces ionic character to the bond through partial charges (Cδ+—Fδ−). The partial charges on the fluorine and carbon are attractive, contributing to the unusual bond strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. The bond is labeled as ""the strongest in organic chemistry,"" because fluorine forms the strongest single bond to carbon. Carbon–fluorine bonds can have a bond dissociation energy (BDE) of up to 130 kcal/mol. The BDE (strength of the bond) of C-F is higher than other carbon–halogen and carbon–hydrogen bonds. For example, the BDEs of the C-X bond within a CH3-X molecule is 115, 104.9, 83.7, 72.1, and 57.6 kcal/mol for X = fluorine, hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, respectively.

Bond length 
The carbon–fluorine bond length is typically about 1.35 ångström (1.39 Å in fluoromethane). It is shorter than any other carbon–halogen bond, and shorter than single carbon–nitrogen and carbon–oxygen bonds, despite fluorine having a larger atomic mass. The short length of the bond can also be attributed to the ionic character/electrostatic attractions between the partial charges on carbon and fluorine. The carbon–fluorine bond length varies by several hundredths of an ångstrom depending on the hybridization of the carbon atom and the presence of other substituents on the carbon or even in atoms farther away. These fluctuations can be used as indication of subtle hybridization changes and stereoelectronic interactions. The table below shows how the average bond length varies in different bonding environments (carbon atoms are sp3-hybridized unless otherwise indicated for sp2 or aromatic carbon).

The variability in bond lengths and the shortening of bonds to fluorine due to their partial ionic character are also observed for bonds between fluorine and other elements, and have been a source of difficulties with the selection of an appropriate value for the covalent radius of fluorine. Linus Pauling originally suggested 64 pm, but that value was eventually replaced by 72 pm, which is half of the fluorine–fluorine bond length. However, 72 pm is too long to be representative of the lengths of the bonds between fluorine and other elements, so values between 54 pm and 60 pm have been suggested by other authors.

Bond strength effect of geminal bonds
With increasing number of fluorine atoms on the same (geminal) carbon the other bonds become stronger and shorter. This can be seen by the changes in bond length and strength (BDE) for the fluoromethane series, as shown on the table below; also, the partial charges (qC and qF) on the atoms change within the series. The partial charge on carbon becomes more positive as fluorines are added, increasing the electrostatic interactions, and ionic character, between the fluorines and carbon.

Gauche effect 

 When two fluorine atoms are in vicinal (i.e., adjacent) carbons, as in 1,2-difluoroethane (H2FCCFH2), the gauche conformer is more stable than the anti conformer—this is the opposite of what would normally be expected and to what is observed for most 1,2-disubstituted ethanes; this phenomenon is known as the gauche effect. In 1,2-difluoroethane, the gauche conformation is more stable than the anti conformation by 2.4 to 3.4 kJ/mole in the gas phase. This effect is not unique to the halogen fluorine, however; the gauche effect is also observed for 1,2-dimethoxyethane. A related effect is the alkene cis effect. For instance, the cis isomer of 1,2-difluoroethylene is more stable than the trans isomer.

There are two main explanations for the gauche effect: hyperconjugation and bent bonds. In the hyperconjugation model, the donation of electron density from the carbon–hydrogen σ bonding orbital to the carbon–fluorine σ* antibonding orbital is considered the source of stabilization in the gauche isomer. Due to the greater electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon–hydrogen σ orbital is a better electron donor than the carbon–fluorine σ orbital, while the carbon–fluorine σ* orbital is a better electron acceptor than the carbon–hydrogen σ* orbital. Only the gauche conformation allows good overlap between the better donor and the better acceptor.

Key in the bent bond explanation of the gauche effect in difluoroethane is the increased p orbital character of both carbon–fluorine bonds due to the large electronegativity of fluorine.  As a result, electron density builds up above and below to the left and right of the central carbon–carbon bond.  The resulting reduced orbital overlap can be partially compensated when a gauche conformation is assumed, forming a bent bond. Of these two models, hyperconjugation is generally considered the principal cause behind the gauche effect in difluoroethane.

Spectroscopy

The carbon–fluorine bond stretching appears in the infrared spectrum between 1000 and 1360 cm−1. The wide range is due to the sensitivity of the stretching frequency to other substituents in the molecule. Monofluorinated compounds have a strong band between 1000 and 1110 cm−1; with more than one fluorine atoms, the band splits into two bands, one for the symmetric mode and one for the asymmetric. The carbon–fluorine bands are so strong that they may obscure any carbon–hydrogen bands that might be present.

Organofluorine compounds can also be characterized using NMR spectroscopy, using carbon-13, fluorine-19 (the only natural fluorine isotope), or hydrogen-1 (if present). The chemical shifts in 19F NMR appear over a very wide range, depending on the degree of substitution and functional group. The table below shows the ranges for some of the major classes.

35,313,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type0,"Aaron Woolfolk (born in Oakland, California) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, and playwright. He shot his first feature film The Harimaya Bridge in Kōchi Prefecture, Japan and San Francisco. The film had a nationwide theatrical release in Japan in the summer of 2009, and had a limited independent release in the United States in 2010. His play Bronzeville, which he co-wrote, opened to critical acclaim in 2009 and has since enjoyed two successful revivals. His podcast dramas There's Something Going on With Sam and Renaissance Man were nominated for numerous awards in 2015 and 2016. Woolfolk was the recipient of an ABC Entertainment Talent Development Grant, and was later a Walt Disney Studios/ABC Entertainment Writing Fellow.

Films

Short films
For his first film, the short Rage!, Woolfolk won a Directors Guild of America award. His short films Eki and Kuroi Hitsuji, both shot in rural Japan, won several awards, screened in international film festivals, and played on cable television. Woolfolk's short film, Nico's Sampaguita, centered around San Francisco's Fillmore Jazz District, also won a number of awards and screened in several film festivals.

Feature films
Woolfolk's feature directorial debut, The Harimaya Bridge, which starred Danny Glover, Ben Guillory, Saki Takaoka and Misa Shimizu, won a number of awards, including Best First Time Feature Director at the Pan African Film Festival. The San Francisco Examiner named it ""one of the best films of the year,"" while the Los Angeles Times called it ""powerful"" and ""a unique, complex, consciousness-raising accomplishment."" The film was invited to screen at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. The film had a nationwide release in Japan and an independent release in the United States, and is also available on DVD and VOD via Netflix, Time Warner Cable, DirecTV, Xfinity, and Cinemanow.

Plays
Woolfolk collaborated with fellow playwright Tim Toyama in writing Bronzeville. It was developed by The Robey Theatre Company, which produced it in association with The Los Angeles Theatre Center. Bronzeville had its world premiere on 17 April 2009 and enjoyed an extended, sold-out run. Woolfolk and Toyama received a nomination for an Ovation Award in the category Best Playwriting for an Original Play. They were also nominated for an NAACP Theater Award in the category Best Playwright.

Podcasts 
In 2015 Woolfolk started collaborating with Earbud Theater, a podcast anthology series that produces radio-like dramas in the vein of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.

Woolfolk's first effort was the horror story ""There's Something Going on With Sam"", which he wrote and directed. The story deals with a mother and son who try to figure out why the once-friendly ghost living in their home has suddenly become cruel and vicious. It received three 2015 Audio Verse Awards nominations in the categories Best Writing of an Original, Long-Form, Standalone Production; Best Original, Long-Form, Standalone Drama; and Best Original, Long-Form, Standalone Production.

His second effort was the 2016 science fiction story ""Renaissance Man"", which he wrote and directed. The story concerns a struggling musician who discovers a secret that allows him to get everything he desires... at a price. It received a 2016 Audio Verse Awards nomination in the category Best Writing of an Original, Long-Form, Self-Contained Production.

In 2017 Woolfolk will direct his original story ""Family Line"".

Notes

Anglican ecclesiastical officesHermann is an Amtrak train station in Hermann, Missouri, United States. Hermann became a permanent stop on September 28, 1991 when the Mules and Ann Rutledge began stopping there. Trains had previously stopped only during Hermann's annual Maifest and Octoberfest.

A rebuilt station was approved for construction in 2006 and opened on September 12, 2014. The one story depot features a random rubble stone veneer base, walls clad in traditional clapboard siding and a hipped roof. The waiting room is trimmed in bead board wainscoting, and there are also accessible restrooms. Displays trace the area's transportation history, with a focus on the Missouri River, railroads and roadways. Funding for the project came through the Federal Highway Administration's Transportation Enhancements program, the city of Hermann and the Dierberg Educational Foundation, a local non-profit organization that supports projects to preserve the region's cultural heritage.

Geography

Most of Burkino Faso is a wide plateau formed by riverine systems and is called falaise de Banfora. There are three major rivers, the Red Volta, Black Volta and White Volta, which cuts through different valleys. The climate is generally hot, with unreliable rains across different seasons. Gold and quartz are common minerals found across the country, while manganese deposits are also common. The dry season is usually from October to May and rains are common during the wet season from June to September. The soil texture is porous and hence the yield is also poor. The average elevation is around  to  above mean sea level. Among West African countries, Burkino Faso has the largest elephant population and the country is replete with game reserves. The northern regions are generally arid and usually have scrub land and semi-deserts. The principal river is the Red Volta, that originates in the northern region and drains into Ghana. The areas near the rivers usually have flies like tsetse and similium, which are carriers of sleep sickness and river blindness. The average rainfall in the region is around  compared to southern regions that receive only  rainfall.

Local administration

Burkina Faso gained independence from France in 1960. It was originally called Upper Volta. There have been military coups till 1983 when Captain Thomas Sankara took control and implemented radical left wing policies. He was ousted by Blaise Compaore, who continued for 27 years till 2014, when a popular uprising ended his rule. As per Law No.40/98/AN in 1998, Burkina Faso adhered to decentralization to provide administrative and financial autonomy to local communities. There are 13 administrative regions, each governed by a Governor. The regions are subdivided into 45 provinces, which are further subdivided into 351 communes. The communes may be urban or rural and are interchangeable. There are other administrative entities like department and village. An urban commune has typically 10,000 people under it. If any commune is not able to get 75 per cent of its planned budget in revenues for 3 years, the autonomy is taken off. The communes are administered by elected Mayors. The communes are stipulated to develop economic, social and cultural values of its citizens. A commune has financial autonomy and can interact with other communes, government agencies or international entities.

26,316,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type0,"The Prospect Park Water Tower, sometimes referred to as the Witch's Hat Water Tower, is a historic water tower in the Prospect Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.  It was built in 1913 on Tower Hill Park, a hilltop park established in 1906.  The water tower has become the neighborhood's architectural mascot for its singular design by Frederick William Cappelen.  The tower is rumored to be the inspiration for Bob Dylan's song ""All Along the Watchtower,"" as the tower was clearly visible from Dylan's home in nearby Dinkytown.

The park and water tower were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for having local significance in the themes of architecture, community planning and development, and engineering.  It was nominated for its associations with city planning, urban infrastructure, architectural eclecticism, and the work of architect Frederick William Cappelen.  In 2015 they were also listed as contributing properties to the Prospect Park Residential Historic District.

History
Erected in 1913 on Tower Hill, one of the highest points in Minneapolis, the tower was built to increase water pressure in the area and thereby enhance firefighting efforts. The functional structure, however, was given a whimsical appearance by city engineer Frederick William Cappelen. To the delight of generations of Minnesotans to come, he topped the building with a fanciful brimmed ""hat"" of green ceramic tile, and hence its nickname was born.

Tower Hill and the Prospect Park neighborhood have enjoyed a love affair of sorts over the years. From the beginning, the tower and surrounding parkland attracted neighbors, young and old, who picnicked under shade trees in summer and sledded down the hill's icy slopes in winter. The tower's observation deck provided views of the Minneapolis and St. Paul skylines, and the building itself inspired many artists who captured its one-of-a-kind profile in charcoal and watercolor.  More than once over the years it has also galvanized neighborhood pride and determination on its own behalf.

The Prospect Park Water Tower ceased to function as a water tower in 1952, but it remained an esteemed neighborhood symbol. In 1955 when the city announced plans to demolish the tower following a lightning strike, the community mobilized. ""Spurred on by eleven members of the Prospect Park Blue Birds (a junior organization of the Campfire Girls),"" neighbors fought city hall and saved their tower.

Since the late 20th century, the observation deck is open only one day a year, which is celebrated with an ice-cream social.

Water towers on the National Register of Historic Places in MinnesotaSzymon Goldberg (1 June 190919 July 1993) was a Polish-born Jewish classical violinist and conductor, latterly an American.

Born in Włocławek, Congress Poland, Goldberg played the violin as a child growing up in Warsaw. His first teacher was Henryk Czaplinski, a pupil of the great Czech violinist Otakar Ševčík; his second was Mieczysław Michałowicz, a pupil of Leopold Auer. In 1917, at age eight, Goldberg moved to Berlin to study the violin with the legendary pedagogue Carl Flesch. He was also a student of Josef Wolfsthal.

After a recital in Warsaw in 1921, and a debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1924 in which he played three concertos, he was engaged as concert-master of the Dresden Philharmonic from 1925 to 1929. In 1929 he was offered the position of concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic by its principal conductor, Wilhelm Furtwängler. He accepted the position, serving from 1930 to 1934. During these years, he also performed in a string trio with Paul Hindemith on viola and Emanuel Feuermann on cello, and also led a string quartet of Berlin Philharmonic members.

The rise of the Third Reich forced Goldberg to leave the orchestra in 1934, despite Furtwängler's attempts to safeguard the Jewish members of the orchestra. Thereafter, he toured Europe with the pianist Lili Kraus. He made his American debut in New York in 1938 at Carnegie Hall. While in the former Netherlands East Indies he formed the Goldberg Quartet, together with Robert Pikler on viola, Louis Mojzer on cello and Eugenie Emerson, piano. Pikler and MOJZER were Hungarians and Emerson was American. This Piano Quartet toured the major cities in Java, before the Japanese invasion and occupation. Goldberg's first wife was a skilled artist and sculptor. She was interned in the Tjihapit Women's Camp in Bandung, together with Mojzer's Family. While Goldberg and Kraus were on a tour of Asia, they and their families were interned in Java by the Japanese from 1942 to 1945.

He toured Australia for three months in 1946.  Eventually he went to the United States and became a naturalised American citizen in 1953. From 1951 to 1965 he taught at the Aspen Music School. Concurrently he was active as a conductor. In 1955 he founded the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra in Amsterdam, which he led until 1979. He also took the ensemble on many tours. From the years 1977 to 1979 he was the conductor of the Manchester Camerata.

He taught at Yale University from 1978 to 1982, the Juilliard School in New York City from 1978 to 1989 the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia from 1980 to 1981, and the Manhattan School of Music in New York starting in 1981. From 1990 until his death, he conducted the New Japan Philharmonic in Tokyo.

His first wife died in the 1980s after a long illness. In 1988, he married his second wife, Japanese pianist Miyoko Yamane (1938–2006), a former student of Rudolf Serkin and Rudolf Kolisch; they resided primarily in Philadelphia (with annual visits to Japan) until 1992, when they moved to Toyama, Japan. He died in Toyama in 1993, aged 84.

He made a number of recordings, most notably a celebrated series of Mozart and Beethoven sonatas with Lili Kraus before World War II, the three Brahms Sonatas with Artur Balsam (Brunswick AXTL 1082), and Mozart and Schubert pieces with Radu Lupu (with whom he performed as a duo in concert) in the 1970s. 
 The Berlin Philharmonic, in a 2014 tribute to their former concertmaster, wrote that in the music of Bach and Mozart, Goldberg ""brought a poise and a beauty of tone that seemed like perfection. Indeed he was the finest Mozart violinist of his time, with the feline grace essential for the violin sonatas, the concertos and the Sinfonia concertante.""

He owned and played the ""Baron Vitta"" Giuseppe Guarneri (Guarneri del Gesù) violin; after his death his widow gave it to the Library of Congress.

60,317,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type0,"The Western Union Company is an American multinational financial services company, headquartered in Denver, Colorado.

Founded in 1851 as the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company in Rochester, New York, the company changed its name to the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1856 after merging with a competitor. The company dominated the American telegraphy industry from the 1860s to the 1980s, pioneering technology such as telex and developing a range of telegraph-related services (including wire money transfer) in addition to its core business of transmitting and delivering telegram messages.

After experiencing financial difficulties, Western Union began to move its business away from communications in the 1980s and increasingly focused on its money transfer services. The company ceased its communications operations completely in 2006 and is now the second largest money transfer provider in the world.

History

Founding & expansion (1851–1866) 

The New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company was founded in Rochester, New York by Samuel L. Selden, Hiram Sibley, and others in 1851. In 1856 the company merged with its competitor the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company, controlled by John James Speed, Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith and Ezra Cornell and changed its name to Western Union Telegraph Company at Cornell's insistence.

In 1857 Western Union participated in the 'Treaty of Six Nations', an attempt by six of the largest telegraph firms to create a system of regional telegraphy monopolies with a shared network of main lines. After the creation of the 'Six Nations' system, Western Union continued to acquire both larger & smaller telegraph companies and by 1864 had transformed from a regional monopoly into a national oligopolist with its only serious competitors being the American Telegraph Company and the United States Telegraph Company.

Western Union completed the first transcontinental telegraph in 1861 and formed the Russian–American Telegraph Company in an attempt to link America to Europe, via Alaska, into Siberia, to Moscow - a project abandoned in 1867 following the successful laying of a transatlantic cable in 1866.

Dominance & new challengers (1866–1881) 

In 1866 Western Union acquired the American Telegraph Company & the United States Telegraph Company, its two main competitors, for a time gaining a virtual monopoly over the American telegraphy industry. The company also began to develop new telegraphy-related services beyond the transmission and delivery of telegrams, launching the first stock ticker in 1866, a standardized time service in 1870 and wire money transfer in 1871.

In the 1870s the company faced increased competition from newly formed rival telegraphy conglomerate Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company and from the nascent telephony industry lead by the Bell Telephone Company. Western Union was originally offered the patent for the telephone, referred to as the 'talking telegraph', by Alexander Graham Bell for $100,000 but the company declined the purchase. Western Union instead attempted to launch a rival telephony system before settling a patent lawsuit with Bell and leaving the telephone business completely in 1879,.

Financier Jay Gould orchestrated a merger of the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company with Western Union in 1881, giving him a controlling share of the merged company.

Monopoly & decline of telegraphy (1881–1963) 

When the Dow Jones Railroad Average stock market index for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was created in 1884, Western Union was one of the original eleven companies to be included. By 1900, Western Union operated a million miles of telegraph lines and two international undersea cables.

AT&T gained control of Western Union in 1909, acquiring a 30% stake in the company. However in 1913 AT&T, under indictment for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, was forced to sell its shares in the company which once again became independent.

Western Union acquired its only major competitor in the American telegraphy sector Postal Telegraph, Inc. in 1945, effectively giving the company monopoly power over the industry. After 1945 the telegraphy industry began to experience a decline, with total telegraph messages almost halving from 1945 to 1960.

In 1958, Western Union began offering telex services to customers in New York City. Teleprinter equipment for the telex network was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Direct international telex services commenced in the summer of 1960, with limited service to London and Paris.

In honor of Valentine's Day 1959, Western Union introduced the Candygram, a box of chocolates accompanying a telegram that was featured in a commercial with the rotund Don Wilson.

Western Union International spin-off 

In 1963, Western Union organized its international cable system properties and its right-of-way for connecting international telegraph lines into a separate company called Western Union International (WUI), which it sold that year to American Securities.

In 1967, American Securities listed WUI as a publicly-traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. WUI was acquired by Xerox for $207 million in stock in 1979 and subsequently sold for $185 million in cash to MCI Communications in 1981. MCI renamed WUI to MCI International, ceasing the use of Western Union branding.

Consolidation (1963–1984) 

Western Union purchased the TWX system from AT&T in January 1969, the only major competitor to its own telex network.

Western Union became the first American telecommunications corporation to maintain its own fleet of geosynchronous communications satellites, starting in 1974. The fleet of satellites, called Westar, carried communications within the Western Union company for telegram and mailgram message data to Western Union bureaus nationwide. It also handled traffic for its telex and TWX services. The Westar satellites' transponders were also leased by other companies for relaying video, voice, data, and facsimile (fax) transmissions.

In 1981, Western Union purchased a 50% interest in Airfone. It sold Airfone to GTE in 1986 for $39 million in cash. From 1982, as a result of financial services deregulation, Western Union began offering wire money transfer services globally.

Financial difficulties, bankruptcies & restructuring (1984–2006) 

In 1984, after years of declining profits and mounting debts, Western Union began to negotiate with its creditors regarding debt restructuring. The restructuring was completed in 1987 when investor Bennett S. LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that was a complex leveraged recapitalization. The transaction was backed by a total of $900 million in high-yield bonds and preferred stock underwritten by Michael Milken's group at Drexel Burnham Lambert as part of an exchange offer. LeBow installed Robert J. Amman as President and CEO who led a complete strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company over the next six years.

Amman executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services, with a money transfer business as a large but less important part of the business, into being a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services. Thus, Amman ran the company as two separate companies. One business consisted of the money transfer business, which was funded and operated to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity. The second unit consisted of all the non-strategic communications assets such as the long-distance analog voice network, satellite business and undersea cable assets.

In the 3-year period through 1990 Amman was supported by Robert A. Schriesheim, also installed by LeBow, as a special advisor who oversaw the divestiture of the four non-strategic telecommunications assets for about $280 million.

The official name of the corporation was changed to New Valley Corporation in 1991, as part of the company's move to seek bankruptcy protection to eliminate the firm's overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business. The name change was used to shield the Western Union name from being dragged through the proceedings (and the resulting bad PR). Under the day to day leadership of Amman and the backing of LeBow, the company's value increased dramatically through its years operating under chapter 11.

As part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Western Union's telegraphy business was sold to iTelegram.

Following various restructurings, including negotiations with Carl Icahn who became a large bond holder, New Valley Corporation was sold in a bankruptcy auction to First Financial Management Corporation in 1994 for $1.2 billion. In 1995, First Financial merged with First Data Corporation in a $6 billion transaction.

After acquiring the company, First Data Corporation made the decision to relaunch telegraphy services under the Western Union brand.

Public listing & international expansion (2006–present) 

On January 26, 2006, First Data announced its intention to spin off Western Union into independent publicly-traded financial services company focused on money transfers through a tax-free spin-off to First Data shareholders. The spin off occurred as planned on September 29, 2006. The next day Western Union announced that it would cease offering telegram transmission and delivery.

In May 2009, Western Union announced its plan to acquire Canada-based Custom House from Peter Gustavson. The deal closed in September 2009 for a purchase price of US$371 million. This acquisition led the company to be re-branded as Western Union Business Solutions. Custom House and its subsidiary XE.com were sold to Euronet Worldwide in 2015 and operate under its HiFX brand.

In January 2011, Western Union acquired Angelo Costa, a group active in money transfer and services to immigrants. Angelo Costa has a network of 7,500 points of sale throughout Europe. The agreement was signed for US$200 million.

In July 2011, Western Union acquired Travelex's Global Business Payments division for £606 million.

In October 2011, Western Union completed the acquisition of Finint S.r.l., one of Western Union's leading money transfer network agents in Europe, with more than 10,000 subagent locations across Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

In May 2015, rumors emerged over a proposed merger of Western Union and competitor MoneyGram, at a time when both companies’ revenue were declining. Western Union denied this was the case. In January 2017, Ant Financial, Alibaba’s financial technology firm instead unsuccessfully attempted to acquire MoneyGram for $880 million, but this was blocked by the U.S. government citing national security concerns.

In November 2020, Western Union acquired 15% stake in the digital payment unit of Saudi Arabia's STC Group for $200 million.

Current services

Wire transfer 

Money can be sent online or in-person at Western Union agent locations. Cash can be collected in person at any other Western Union agent location worldwide by providing the 10-digit MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number) and identification. In some cases, a secret question and answer can be used instead of identification.

Western Union Mobile
In October 2007, Western Union announced plans to introduce a mobile money-transfer service with the GSM Association, a global trade association representing more than 700 mobile operators in 218 countries and covering 2.5 billion mobile subscribers.

The proliferation of mobile phones in developed and developing economies provides a widely accessible consumer device capable of delivering mobile financial services ranging from text notifications associated with Western Union cash delivery services to phone-based remittance options. Western Union's mobile money transfer service offering will connect its core money-transfer platform to m-bank or m-wallet platforms provided by mobile operators and/or locally regulated financial institutions.

Western Union Connect 
The company launched the Western Union Connect service in October 2015, following partnership agreements with major instant messaging apps WeChat and Viber. The partnership allows users of WeChat to send up to $100 to China, the US and 200 other countries, while Viber users can send up to $100 for $3.99 plus exchange rate fees, with that fixed fee increasing the more money is sent up a limit of $499.

Past services

Communications

Along with satellite telecommunications, Western Union was also active in other forms of telecommunication services:
 Common carrier terrestrial microwave networks
 Business communications networks such as Telex and TWX, which was acquired from AT&T Corporation and renamed Telex II by Western Union
 Landline-based leased voice and data communication circuits
 Long distance telephone service
 Airfone air-ground radiotelephone service from 1981 to 1986
 Cellular phone service for a short time in the early 1980s (the phones were made by two-way radio manufacturer E. F. Johnson Company)

Most of these services were discontinued by Western Union in the late 1980s due to a lack of profitability, with the company's divisions providing said services being divested and sold to other companies, such as the 1988 sale of WU's satellite fleet and services to Hughes Space and Communications, and the sale of WU's Airfone service to GTE in 1986.

BidPay
As the Internet became an arena for commerce at the turn of the millennium, Western Union started its online services. BidPay was renamed ""Western Union Auction Payments"" in 2004 before being renamed back to BidPay. BidPay ceased operations on December 31, 2005, and was purchased for US$1.8 million in March 2006 by CyberSource Corp. who announced their intention to re-launch BidPay. BidPay was later discontinued by CyberSource effective December 31, 2007.

Western Union was a major shirt-sponsor of the Sydney Roosters NRL team from 2002–2003. The company still sponsors the team, but not as a shirt-sponsor. Globally Western Union sponsors numerous community events that help support the diaspora communities that use the global Money Transfer service. They also sponsored numerous WWE and WCW pay-per-view events such as the No Way Out 1998 and Slamboree 2000. They sponsored UEFA Europa League from 2012 until 2015.

The First Data Western Union Foundation donates money to charitable causes globally. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the Foundation donated US$1,000,000 to the relief effort.

The Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association announced a three-year deal making Western Union the team's jersey sponsor, beginning with the 2017–18 NBA Season.

Liverpool F.C. announced on August 9, 2017 that Western Union would become their first ever sleeve sponsors, from the start of the 2017–18 Season. They signed a £25m deal for 5 years as Liverpool's sleeve sponsor.

Involvement in early computer networking
Western Union telegrams were transmitted through a store and forward message switching system. Early versions were manual telegraph systems. Later systems using teleprinters were semi-automatic, using punched paper tape to receive, store, and retransmit messages. Plan 55-A, Western Union's last paper tape based switching system (1948–1976), was fully automatic, with automatic routing.

Western Union was a prime contractor in the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) program. AUTODIN, a military application for communication, was first developed in the 1960s and became the precursor to the modern Internet in the 1990s. The Defense Message System (DMS) replaced AUTODIN in 2000.

AUTODIN, originally named ""ComLogNet"", was a reliable service that operated at 99.99% availability, using mechanical punched card readers and tab machines to send and receive data over leased lines. During the peak operation of AUTODIN, the US portion of the network handled 20 million messages a month. Western Union failed in its attempts to engineer a replacement (AUTODIN II), leading to the development of an acceptable packet-switched network by BBN (the developer of the ARPANET) which became the foundation of today's Internet. AUTODIN service ceased in 2000, years after it had become obsolete.

A related innovation that came from AUTODIN was Western Union's computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed one of the first marketable email systems for non-government users. The system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, mailgram, or telex services as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink was spun off as a separate company and is now part of OpenText.

Controversies

Scam industry and money laundering 

Western Union advises its customers not to send money to someone that they have never met in person. Despite its efforts in increasing customers' awareness of the issue, Western Union is used for internet fraud by scammers.

Western Union has been required to maintain records of payout locations of the individuals who may be laundering the money, though this information may be obtained only through the use of a subpoena. Hence advance-fee fraud and romance scammers continue to receive funds via Western Union confident in the knowledge that money lost to overseas scammers is almost always unrecoverable. For this reason, it is banned as a medium of payment through eBay, and discouraged on other online auction websites.

Western Union admitted to allowing wire fraud in January 2017 and agreed to pay $586m, for turning a blind eye as criminals used its service for advance fee fraud. Scammers engaging in various 419 advance fee scams including offering fake job offers and lottery prizes, were able to process transactions using Western Union money transfer, mainly by giving the agents a share of the earnings from their scams. Western Union failed to investigate hundreds of thousands of complaints that were filed by victims.

Money laundering and terrorist financing 

The Central Bank of Ireland reprimanded and fined Western Union €1.75m in May 2015 because of failures in anti money laundering practices which could have left the firm's payment services open to being used for money laundering and/or terrorist financing saying that they were concerned that Western Union ""failed to have in place sufficiently robust systems and procedures to train agents, to monitor and identify suspicious activity in respect of smaller transactions, and to maintain appropriate records"" and ""the splitting of payments into many separate smaller payments is a common method used to launder money. Similarly, terrorist financing is often carried out by small payment transfers.""

Western Union agents also allowed Chinese immigrants to the US to use the service to send hundreds of millions of dollars, by sending the amounts in smaller increments to avoid transfer reporting requirements, to pay human smugglers.

In 2017, Western Union admitted to anti-money laundering and consumer fraud violations and agreed to pay $586 million in a settlement with the Department of Justice.  Among other charges, the Justice Department showed that Western Union was complicit in creating an ecosystem where criminals were able to engage in consumer fraud and human trafficking. The charges were dismissed in March 2020.

In 2018, Western Union was fined $60 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The press release accompanying the fine stated that, ""Western Union executives put profits ahead of the company’s responsibilities to detect and prevent money laundering and fraud, by choosing to maintain relationships with and failing to discipline obviously suspect, but highly profitable, agents.""

On May 29, 2019, Western Union announced the departure of a company executive, Odilon Almeida, who served as executive vice president and president of Global Money Transfer.  In 2012, Stewart Stockdale, who had the same position as Almeida, left the company in a similar situation.

Connection to military intelligence 
The book ""The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11"" alleged that Western Union provided United States military intelligence with personal information.

Blocked transactions 
Western Union has begun blocking transactions based on suspicion of terrorist connections, as a part of the company's involvement with the War on Terror.

Anti-competitive behavior  
Western Union has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive behavior in Africa as a result of a lack of competition on the continent. According to a report by the Overseas Development Institute, this allows Western Union to artificially inflate its fees for money transfers, charging what has been called an “Africa charge” of 8% consistently “applied across countries regardless of the size of the market, regulatory costs or market risk.” However, the fees can be as high as 10% or more, depending on the region. Africa's remittance market remains the most expensive in the world, and the region is estimated to incur excess costs of $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion per year as a result of these high remittance fees.

The company has also been criticized for its use of exclusivity agreements with banks in countries that receive remittances, restricting competition and harming the consumer, by requiring the consumer to conduct transactions via nominated banks. This also allows for the imposition of above-average transaction fees.

In February 2016, Western Union was questioned by the EU antitrust regulator over its network of agents to establish whether the company colluded with banks to push out smaller rivals from the money transfer market.

History of the telegraphThe private bank Merck Finck Privatbankiers AG, founded in 1870, is based in Munich and is also represented nationwide with a total of 16 locations. Since 2011, it has been a subsidiary of the Luxembourg bank KBL European Private Bankers (KLB), which was renamed Quintet Private Bank in January 2020.

History
Merck Finck was founded under the company Merck, Christian & Co. on 1 July 1870 by Adolf Karl Ludwig Christian and banker Heinrich Johann Merck. Other limited partners were the Darmstater Bank forerunner of the Danatbank and the entrepreneur Theodor von Cramer-Klett. By 1879, together with his brother August, who replaced the departing general Christian, the previous authorized representative Wilhelm von Finck already held a large part of the bank assets. As part of these changes, the bank was renamed Merck, Finck & Co.
The core business of the bank was corporate financing and issuing corporate bonds. The bank was involved in the founding of companies such as the Süddeutsche Bodencreditbank AG (1871), the brewery Bürgerliches Brauhaus München (1880), the Isarwerke GmbH (1894) and the Münchener Trambahn-AG. In 1890, Merck Finck subscribed for almost 40% of the share capital of Allianz Versicherungs-AG. As a representative of the bank, Wilhelm Finck often took on a supervisory board mandate with the shareholdings and thus brought his economic expertise to a wide variety of companies.

His work was honored in 1905 with the appointment to the Imperial Council of the Crown of Bavaria. This brought the family also the elevation to the hereditary peerage.

After the bank had developed positively in the deposit, lending and securities business at the turn of the century, the First World War interrupted the upswing. The capital market was heavily regulated. The period of inflation after the end of the war also prevented further expansion. Despite falling revenues, the bank was able to continue its operations without external help.

Another turning point was the death of Wilhelm von Finck in 1924. His share of the bank of nearly 100% was shared equally between his son August von Finck Sr. and his daughters Margarete von Stengel and Elisabeth Winterstein.

The death of William von Finck and the take over of the banking business by his son ushered in a new era. Merck Finck & Co. made a major contribution to the founding of aircraft construction and air traffic companies: with Udet-Flugzeugbau GmbH, a predecessor of today's DASA, and Süddeutsche Aero Lloyd AG, a predecessor to Lufthansa, important industry pioneers were created in Germany.

The global economic crisis imposed further restrictions on banking from 1929 onwards. Nevertheless, it was possible to participate in businesses like the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk, the sparkling wine cellar J. Oppmann and the Gesellschaft für Markt und Kühlhallen in Hamburg.

After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1938, Merck, Finck & Co. took the opportunity to acquire Wiener Privatbankhaus S. M. v. Rothschild. This highly renowned Austrian private bank, owned by Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild, had controlled the Österreichische Kreditanstalt until 1931. From July 1938 it was provisionally administered by Merck, Finck & Co., in 1940 it was ""made aryan"" by the newly founded bank E. v. Nicolai in Vienna; here Merck, Finck & Co. was involved with 71% and the German industrial bank (Düsseldorf) with 19%. After the Second World War the remaining values were given back to Louis Nathaniel von Rothschild, but he renounced the rebuilding of the bank S. M. v. Rothschild.

After a period between state influence and free enterprise under the Nazi regime, the bank Merck, Finck & Co. was completely paralyzed in post-war times, not least because of the involvement of the owners and senior executives in Nazi economic policy. It was not until 1949 that Merck Finck & Co. was able to resume business operations in the newly constructed bank building. The bank was now heavily involved in the securities industry. Through this and the support of August von Finck Jr. and later Wilhelm Winterstein August von Finck senior managed to re-enter the banking market.
In the following years, the bank expanded by founding new branches outside of Bavaria. Together with the family of steel industrialist Fritz von Waldthausen, the banking house Waldthausen & Co. was founded in 1954. Merck Finck & Co. took over the business of the banking house Alwin Steffan from Frankfurt am Main, to which it had longstanding connections, with the death of the senior partner in 1963.

Surprisingly August von Finck junior sold the bank for about DM 600 million to the British Barclays Bank Plc in October 1990. Due to tax reforms of the previous years undisclosed reserves that had been built up over generations were used up. In order to pay the taxes due, even parts of the over 100-year-old stock portfolio had been sold. The Barclays branches in Hamburg, Stuttgart and Berlin changed their name and became branches of Merck Finck & Co. However, as the broad retail banking of the new parent company was incompatible with private banking, which was firmly established in the bank, Barclays Bank sold Merck Finck in 1999 to KBL European Private Bankers (KBL epb), to which it has belonged ever since.

In 2002, Merck Finck acquired WestLB's German private banking unit. In 2005, the private banking business of Westfalenbank AG was acquired.

On 21 May 2010, the Indian investment company Hinduja Group announced that it would take over the KBL European Private Bankers division from the Belgian KBC Bank for €1.35 billion. However, on 16 March 2011 it became known that the Luxembourg financial regulator Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) refused to approve the sale. Thus, Merck Finck remained in the possession of the Belgian financial group KBC.

On October 10, 2011, it was announced that the Belgian KBC Group is selling its KBL European Private Bankers division for €1.05 billion to a Luxembourg holding called Precision Capital, which is backed by private individuals in Qatar. These belong to the family Al-Thani, which has shaped the political events of Qatar for about 200 years. The purchase was completed in July 2012. The KBL Group also includes the French Richelieu Banque Privée, Brown Shipley & Co in the UK and Theodoor Gilissen bankers in the Netherlands. On 1 September 2016, the private bank Merck Finck & Co changed its legal form, the Merck Finck & Co. oHG became Merck Finck Privatbankiers AG.

In January 2020, KBL European Private Bank changed its name to Quintet Private Bank and Merck Finck has since carried the addition ""A Quintet Private Bank"".

MF Foundation
Merck Finck has created a foundation to engage with clients for selected promotional purposes. The aim of the foundation is to support society in Germany in the further development of important future fields. The focus is on these topics:

 Education and parenting
 Youth and elderly help
 Science and research
 Arts and culture
 Nature and environmental protection
 Public health service
 Monument protection and preservation of monuments

Criticism
The weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported in May 2014 that the adviser for large winners of the Westdeutsche Lotterie has conspicuously often mediated winners of large sums of money to the bank in order to invest the money over the long term. The article argues that lottery winners have often received poor advice and that asset classes such as ship funds and open-ended real estate funds have often led to losses. Westlotto denies that the employee would have had financial benefits from the negotiations.

In April 2014, the bank was convicted in one case because of falsely advising lottery winners. A married couple had won more than €6 million from Westlotto and invested them with Merck Finck & Co. The bank persuaded the couple to invest in so-called closed-end funds, which turned out to be uncertain, so that the couple lost a large part of the lottery prize. The Landgericht Münster established a false counsel and sentenced the bank to pay €510,000 to the couple.

Localities in QueenslandBanksia armata var. ignicida is a variety of shrub that is endemic to Western Australia. It differs from the autonym (Banksia armata var. armata) in not having a lignotuber. It is also usually a taller plant with leaves that are longer with fewer side lobes, and longer flowers.

Description
Banksia armata var. ignicida is a shrub that typically grows to a height of up to  and lacks a lignotuber. It has leaves that are  long and  wide and deeply serrated with between five and eight triangular, sharply pointed lobes on each side. The perianth is yellow,  long and the pistil  long.

Taxonomy
Specimens of B. armata were first collected in 1801, and the description was published in 1810 in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London by Robert Brown as Dryandra armata. In 1996, Alex George described two varieties of D. armata in the journal Nuytsia. The type specimens of D. armata var. ignicida were collected by him east of Woodanilling. The varietal epithet (ignicida) is from the Latin ignis (""fire"") and -cidus (""killing""), in reference to the fact that this variety is killed by fire (because it lacks a lignotuber). In 2007, all Dryandra species were transferred to Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele and the change is accepted by the Australian Plant Census.

Distribution and habitat
This variety occurs through much of the south-west of Western Australia, being widespread between Pingelly and Katanning, and east to Mount Ragged in the Cape Arid National Park.

Owned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts on 102.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 92,000 watts (class C1) using an omnidirectional antenna on Mount Orford. This gives the station an impressive coverage area, as far west as Montreal, and as far south as St. Johnsbury, Vermont and Littleton, New Hampshire. However, it suffers from severe deficiencies in downtown Sherbrooke, most likely due to tall buildings blocking its signal in some areas. As a result, the station also operates a low-power relay in Sherbrooke, CITE-FM-2, which broadcasts on 94.5 MHz with an effective radiated power of 50 watts, also using an omnidirectional antenna.

The station has an adult contemporary format, and is part of the ""Rouge FM"" (formerly ""RockDétente"") network which operates across Quebec and Eastern Ontario.

Although the station's call sign suggests it is a relay of CITE-FM in Montreal, it is not actually a relay and programs from Montreal are not more common than on other Rouge FM stations (which have independent call signs). The reason for this irregular call sign is unclear. There is no known record among CRTC decisions suggesting that CITE-FM-1 was ever a full-time relay of CITE-FM in Montreal, or that the proportion of programming coming from Montreal was ever higher than for other Rouge FM stations. However, the station's signal reaches into the Montreal area, and anecdotal observations suggest that a modest but still noticeable number of Montreal-area listeners listen to it rather than CITE-FM. Since it is highly plausible that some of these listeners report ambiguously their listening in BBM diaries, as a result their listening to the Sherbrooke station would be assigned as per BBM rules to the Montreal station, which may explain the Sherbrooke station's unusual call sign.

CITE-FM-1 started as CHLT-FM in 1960, as it was created as a sister station to CHLT AM (now known as CKOY-FM, which previously used the CHLT-FM calls after its move from AM to FM), also in Sherbrooke. Since early 2005, they are no longer sister stations, as CKOY-FM is now owned by Cogeco. CITE-FM-1 was briefly known as CITE-FM in 1977, just before CITE-FM in Montreal started to broadcast.

On August 28, 1976, CHLT-FM became CITE-FM.

On August 18, 2011, at 4:00 p.m. EDT, all ""RockDétente"" stations, including CITE-FM-1, rebranded as Rouge FM. The last song under ""RockDétente"" was Pour que tu m'aimes encore by Celine Dion, followed by a tribute of the branding. The first song under ""Rouge"" was I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas.

Heavyweight boxersThe Wizard of Linn is a science fiction novel  by Canadian American writer A. E. van Vogt, a sequel to Empire of the Atom. The novel was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine Astounding Science Fiction (April - June 1950).  It was first published in book form in Germany in 1961 by Terra Sonderband, as Der Zauberer von Linn.

Plot
An alien starship has entered the solar system sometime in the Sixth Century of the Thirteenth Millennium A. D.  The ship appears to belong to the Riss, an alien race who had come to Sol millennia ago and destroyed the thriving human civilization.  Now the descendants of the survivors, living in a medieval society with spaceships, must face the threat again.  One of those is Jerrin, Lord Advisor of the Linnan Empire.  Jerrin is annoyed that his brother, the mutant atom priest Clane, knew about the Riss incursion before he did and is more annoyed when Clane recommends an attack on the Riss ship, one that is guaranteed to fail.

The attack does indeed fail, but Clane, Jerrin, and their associates are protected by a glassy-looking aetherial sphere that Clane controls mentally and that absorbs energy.  For his second attack Clane sneaks aboard the Riss ship and uses the sphere to eliminate the crew.  Taking over the ship, Clane flies it to his estate.  There he discovers that Jerrin has been assassinated, poisoned by his wife Lilidel, who was concerned that her son Calaj was to be disinherited from the Lord Advisorship.  Worse, Clane discovers that his magic sphere has been stolen by followers of Czinczar, a barbarian from Europa who recently tried to conquer the Empire of Linn.

Calaj becomes Lord Advisor and Clane convinces him to sign a document, which he does without reading it.  Lilidel is incensed: though the document appears to strengthen Calaj, she is suspicious, especially knowing that Clane has disappeared.  Then the Riss arrive.

Clane has taken part of his army along with Czinczar and his army aboard the captured Riss ship, which he has renamed Solar Star, and has headed out on a one-year journey to a star sixty-five light-years from Sol.  On arrival they discover two Earth-like planets revolving about their common center of mass as they go around their sun.  The planets are occupied by humans, but Clane and his crew are shocked to discover that those people can teleport themselves and other things at will and that they have a peaceful trading relationship with the Riss.  During the visit Clane and his crew engage and destroy a Riss battleship.  Then, using star maps retrieved from the wreckage, Clane takes the Solar Star on a three-month voyage to a Riss solar system.

Clane and his army establish a bridgehead on the Riss planet and fend off a Riss attack.  After the attack the Terrans discover humans living in vast artificial caverns and Clane discovers that they have another aetherial sphere, which he controls with his thoughts.  Taking the sphere with them, Clane and his men reboard the Solar Star and return to Earth.

Clane quickly re-establishes himself on Earth and takes over the government, using the document that Calaj so carelessly signed.  He sends Lilidel and Calaj into exile and then employs the aetherial sphere in a new way to defeat the Riss.

He later became a federal witness after his son committed suicide with the fear of being killed by Nicodemo Scarfo and his fellow gangsters.  He later returned to his old lifestyle and in 1993, was murdered by his old associates for cooperating as a government witness.  Riccobene had been in the witness protection program but eventually removed from the program because he was unable to follow the rules.

Early life
Born in Philadelphia to Sicilian immigrant parents, he was the half- brother of Harold Riccobene.  He joined the Bruno family in the 1950s, frequently working as a driver for Angelo Bruno.

Criminal life
During the Bruno-Scarfo war, the violence was increasing and Mario was approached by Scarfo's consigliere Frank Monte to ""(turn) over his brother"" but he refused.  Riccobene ended up telling his brother. In May 1982, Monte was fatally shot in response.

In 1983, he and Harry were convicted of racketeering.  He was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in jail and a $10,000 fine.

1993 deathsTangerine is the third album by the American rock band Vixen. It was recorded without contributions from Jan Kuehnemund and Share Pederson. The line-up for this album consisted of Janet Gardner, Gina Stile, and Roxy Petrucci. Tangerine has a different sound from the music of the previous albums of the band, more similar to post-grunge than glam metal. This is the only album to have Stile as Vixen guitarist and the final studio release to feature Gardner as vocalist-guitarist during their tenures in the band; they were forced to part ways following the Tangerine tour for legal reasons as the courts found Kuehnemund to be the sole owner of the band name thereby making this release unrecognized and unofficial. 

Stile and Gardner later rejoined Vixen in 2013, along with Ross and Petrucci, after playing as the former JanetShareRoxyGina (JSRG) line-up. Stile and Gardner left the band for good in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

Manufacturing companies based in Rochester, New YorkPietro Colletta (January 23, 1775 – November 11, 1831) was a Neapolitan general and historian, entered the Neapolitan artillery in 1796 and took part in the campaign against the French in 1798.

Biography
Colletta was born in Naples. On the entry of the French into the Kingdom of Naples and the establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic (1799), Colletta adhered to the new government.  When the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV reconquered the city, Colletta was thrown into prison and only escaped the death penalty by means of judiciously administered bribes.  Turned out of the army, he became a civil engineer.  When the Bourbons were expelled a second time in 1806 and Joseph Bonaparte seized the throne of Naples, he was reinstated in his rank and served in the expedition against the brigands and rebels of Calabria.

In 1812, Colletta was promoted to general, and made director of roads and bridges.  He served under Joachim Murat and fought the Austrians at the Battle of the Panaro in 1815.  On the restoration of Ferdinand, Colletta was permitted to retain his rank in the army, and was given command of the Salerno division.  At the outbreak of the revolution of 1820 the king called him to his councils, and, when the constitution had been granted, Colletta was sent to put down the separatist rising in Sicily, which he did with great severity.

He fought in the constitutionalist army against the Austrians at Rieti (March 7, 1821).  On the re-establishment of autocracy, he was arrested and imprisoned for three months by order of the Prince of Canosa, the chief of police and his particular enemy.  He would have been executed had not the Austrians intervened in his favour, and he was exiled instead to Brünn in Moravia.  In 1823, he was permitted to settle in Florence, where he spent the rest of his days engaged on his Storia del reame di Napoli.

Works
His history (first published in 1834), which deals with the reigns of Charles III and Ferdinand IV (1734–1825), is still the standard work for that period, but its value is somewhat diminished by the authors bitterness against his opponents and the fact that he does not provide references for his statements, many of which are based on his recollection of documents seen, but not available at the time of writing. Still, having been an actor in many of the events recorded, he is on the whole accurate and trustworthy.

22,324,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type9,"Kvens (, , , , ) are a Balto-Finnic ethnic minority in Norway. They descended from Finnish peasants and fishermen who emigrated from the northern parts of Finland and Sweden to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1996, the Kvens were granted minority status in Norway, and in 2005 the Kven language was recognized as a minority language in Norway.

Name

The origin of the term Kven is disputed. There is no evidence that modern Kvens are descendants of the Kvens mentioned in a few ancient Norwegian and Icelandic sources. As a result of Norway signing the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 1999, the term Kven became for the first time an official name, the name of Finnish descendants with a long history in Norway who view themselves as a member of that particular ethnic minority group of Finnish descent.

There is a theory among some academic groups that due to the discrimination and suppression by the Norwegian authorities the term Kven became derogatory in the late 19th century. Therefore, many Kvens  preferred to be called 'kainulaiset'. But with the revitalization of the Kven culture in the 1970s, Kvens themselves started using the term. However, even in the 1990s there was a debate whether the Norwegian terms , , or  (respectively a Finnish person, Finnish, and of Finnish origin) should be used instead. However, today the term Kven is accepted and used, for example, in the name of the Kven organization in Norway (Norske Kveners Forbund).

Demographics
The Kvens were registered as a separate group in the Norwegian censuses in the period 1845 to 1930. From the 18th century the Kvens started to comprise a significant part of the population in Northern Norway. In 1845 13.3% of the population in Finnmark, and 3.2% in Troms, considered themselves as Kvens. In 1854 the numbers increased to respectively, 19.9% and 7.0%. The peak was in 1875, with respectively 24.2% and 7.7%. The ratios were reduced to respectively 20.2% and 3.7%, in 1890, and 13.8% and 2.0% in 1900 (all numbers from).
In the 1930 census there were 8,215 registered Kvens in Troms and Finnmark. In 1950, 1,439 people reported that they used the Finnish language in Troms (58 people) and Finnmark (1,381 people).

In 2001, the number of Kvens was estimated to be about 10,000 to 15,000 in a parliamentary inquiry on national minorities in Norway. However, estimating the number of Kvens is difficult since there is no official definition of a Kven. Therefore, other studies have estimated the number of Kvens to be about 50,000–60,000, based on the criteria that at least one grandparent spoke Kven. But many of these may consider themselves to be Norwegian or Sami or a combination.

History
Danish/Norwegian tax records from the 16th century already list some Kvens living in North Norway. Also, the famous map of Scandinavia by Olaus Magnus from 1539 shows a possible Kven settlement roughly in between today's Tromsø and Lofoten named ""Berkara Qvenar"". Kvens of this time are often connected to the birkarl organization in northern Sweden. In some early documents Kvens are also grouped together with the Sami people, who are the indigenous people of Central and Northern Norway.

The main immigration of Kvens to Norway can be divided into two periods. The first immigration was from about 1720 to 1820, when Finnish speaking people from the northern Finland and Torne River Valley moved to river basins and fjord-ends in Troms and the western parts of Finnmark, to places such as Polmak, Karasjok, Porsanger, Alta and Lyngen.

The second immigration was after 1820 until about 1890 to the coastal areas of eastern Finnmark, motivated by the booming fishing industry in Northern Norway. In addition, it was also easier to get to America from there than from Northern Finland and many moved to Finnmark before continuing over the Atlantic.  Migration ended from problems in the fishing industry, population pressure, migration to America and increasing problems for Kven in buying land and getting Norwegian citizenship.

Language
The Kven language is a Finnic language. From a linguistic point of view, Kven is a mutually intelligible dialect of Finnish, but for political and historical reasons, it received in 2005 status of a legal minority language in Norway, within the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

Kven differs from Finnish since the Kven population was in effect isolated from other Finnish-speaking people. The Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian loanwords, and Finnish words that are no longer used in Finland are still used. In a 2005 government report, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used.

Ethnic controversies
In the 1990s there was a debate among Kvens whether they should be considered as an ethnic group of their own, or whether they were Finnish Norwegians. As well, during the process of legal recognition of the Kven language, there was a debate as to whether it should be considered an actual language or merely a dialect of Finnish, and whether the Kven language or Kven dialect of Finnish should be taught in schools.

Kven and Sami people share a common history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization policies have treated them differently. Sami people have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of Finnmark Estate (the organization owning about 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami people too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people.

Lately, the Norwegian Kven Organization has attempted to get the Kvens recognized, similarly to the Sami people, as an indigenous people in Norway. This has made it important for some Kvens to show that their history stretches further back in time than commonly believed. There has been some recent unofficial adoption of the word ""Kainu"" as the new name for ""Kven"", in accordance with the hypotheses put forward by Finnish historians Jouko Vahtola and Kyösti Julku. Vahtola has hypothesized that words ""Kven"" and ""Kainu(u)"" are interchangeable.

In 2018, The Storting commissioned The Truth and Reconciliation Commission to lay the foundation for recognition of the experiences of the Kven subject to norwegianization and the subsequent consequences.

Modern recognition
The flag of Kvenland was hoisted at the Kiruna City Hall in Sweden on 16 March 2013, at 11:00, in celebration and honour of the first annual Day of the Kvens. Hereafter, that date is meant to be recognised wider in the Kven communities of the north and by others as well.

The date for the occasion was chosen from the 14th century signing of a state treaty between Sweden and Kvenland, known as Tälje Charter (""Tälje stadga"" in Swedish). In that treaty, the king of Sweden guaranteed the Kvens (""Birkarls"") trading rights in the north (translation from Latin last printed in 1995, Wallerström, page 48).

In the past, the Kven language spoken in Norway was considered a dialect of Finnish language, much like the Finnic Meänkieli language spoken in northern Sweden. Today, both are officially recognised minority languages in the areas where the languages are spoken. The Finnish, Meänkieli and Sami all are officially recognised minority languages in the Kiruna Municipality in Sweden.

Culture and media

Ruijan Kaiku

Ruijan Kaiku is a bi-lingual newspaper (Kven/Finnish and Norwegian) that is published in Tromsø, Norway. Currently one issue is published each month. The newspaper writes mostly about Kven issues, and about the work of strengthening Finnish language and culture in Norway. In addition the paper has stories about other Finnish organizations in Norway, and about other Finnish minorities in the Nordic and surrounding countries. The newspaper's Chief editor is Liisa Koivulehto.

Baaski festival

Baaski is a Kven culture festival held in Nordreisa. The first festival was in June 2007, but it is intended to be an annual event. The responsible organizers is Nordreisa municipality, and the first festival director was Johanne Gaup.

Kven costume
In the late 1990s a Kven costume was designed. It is not a reconstruction of an old costume, but rather a new design based on pictures and other sources about the clothing and jewelry used by Kvens in the late 19th and early 20th century. The purpose of creating the costume was to unify and strengthen Kven identity.

Kadonu Loru
Kadonu Loru is the only pop music single ever recorded in the Kven language. It is based on an old Kven nursery rhyme about making sausages. The artists are Karine Jacobsen and Kine Johansen respectively from Børselv and Lakselv. The single was published by Iđut.

Organisations and institutions

The Norwegian Kven organization

The Norwegian Kven Organization (Ruijan Kveeniliitto in Kven/Finnish and Norske Kveners Forbund in Norwegian) was established in 1987, and has currently about 700 members. The organization has local branches in: Skibotn, Børselv, Nord-Varanger, Tana, Lakselv, Alta, northern Troms, Tromsø, and Østlandet.

The tasks of the organisation include working for a government report about the history and rights of the Kven population, improving the media coverage of Kven issues, and for the Norwegian government to establish a secretary (statssekretær) for Kven issues. In addition, reading and writing classes at the beginner to advanced level, establishing a Kven kindergarten, and to incorporate the Kven language in all education levels in Norway. Also, to establish a Kven culture fund, road and other signs in Kven, Kven names in official maps, and museums and centers for Kven language and culture.

The seat was won by Preston King, a former U.S. Representative and member of the newly-formed Republican Party. King was the first Republican elected to represent New York, although William H. Seward had joined the party after being elected as a Whig in 1855.

Background
Whig Hamilton Fish had been elected in 1851 to this seat, and his term would expire on March 3, 1857.

In 1855, the Whig Party and the Anti-Nebraska Party merged in New York to form the Republican Party.

At the State election in November 1855, 16 Republicans, 11 Americans, 4 Democrats and 1 Temperance man were elected for a two-year term (1856-1857) in the State Senate. At the State election in November 1856, 81 Republicans, 31 Democrats and 8 Americans were elected to the Assembly for the session of 1857. The 80th New York State Legislature met from January 6 to April 18, 1857, at Albany, New York.

Candidates
Preston King was nominated by a caucus of Republican State legislators. King had been a Democratic congressman from 1843 to 1847, a Free Soil congressman from 1849 to 1853, and had joined the Republican Party upon its foundation at the State convention in September 1855. The convention nominated King for Secretary of State, but he was defeated by Joel T. Headley in a four-way race.

Secretary of State Joel T. Headley was the candidate of the American Party.

State Senator Daniel E. Sickles was the candidate of the Democratic Party.

Election
In the Assembly the vote confirmed the party caucus selections. When State Senator Sickles received votes, the same objection to his eligibility was raised as was in 1833 regarding Nathaniel P. Tallmadge. This time, Speaker DeWitt C. Littlejohn ruled that the objection was ""partially tenable and partially not so."" However, the Speaker held that any member could vote for anybody, and only if the candidate received sufficient votes to win the election, a decision would be required. Otherwise, like in this case, the eligibility of an also-ran was irrelevant.

In the State Senate, only 24 votes were given. Zenas Clark (Rep.) and John B. Halsted (Rep.) were sick at home. Eaton J. Richardson (Rep.) paired with Sidney Sweet (Am.). Joseph H. Petty (Am.) was absent. William Kelly (Dem.), Mark Spencer (Dem.), and the Democratic candidate Sickles himself, declined to vote.

State Senator Justin A. Smith (Am.) raised the question if the vote for Sickles could be counted. A new State Constitution had been adopted in 1846, which had clarified the question of eligibility of State legislators. Smith quoted from the State Constitution: ""No member of the Legislature shall receive any civil appointment within this State, or to the Senate of the United States, from the Governor, the Governor and Senate, or from the Legislature,  during the term for which he shall have been elected; and all votes given for any such member, for any such office or appointment, shall be void."" Lt. Gov. Henry R. Selden (later a judge of the New York Court of Appeals) decided to count the vote, holding that the United States Constitution described the eligibility for the office and devolved on the State legislatures only the power to prescribe the ""times, places and manners of holding the elections for that office"", thus not implying a right for the State governments to exclude any person who would be eligible under the U.S. Constitution.

Result
Preston King was the choice of both the Assembly and the Senate, and was declared elected.

Aftermath
King served one term, and remained in office until March 3, 1863.

5,325,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type4,"Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a quantum mechanical magnetoresistance effect observed in multilayers composed of alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers. The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg for the discovery of GMR.

The effect is observed as a significant change in the electrical resistance depending on whether the magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic layers are in a parallel or an antiparallel alignment. The overall resistance is relatively low for parallel alignment and relatively high for antiparallel alignment. The magnetization direction can be controlled, for example, by applying an external magnetic field. The effect is based on the dependence of electron scattering on spin orientation.

The main application of GMR is in magnetic field sensors, which are used to read data in hard disk drives, biosensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and other devices. GMR multilayer structures are also used in magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) as cells that store one bit of information.

In literature, the term giant magnetoresistance is sometimes confused with colossal magnetoresistance of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic semiconductors, which is not related to a multilayer structure.

Formulation
Magnetoresistance is the dependence of the electrical resistance of a sample on the strength of an external magnetic field. Numerically, it is characterized by the value

 

where R(H) is the resistance of the sample in a magnetic field H, and R(0) corresponds to H = 0. Alternative forms of this expression may use electrical resistivity instead of resistance, a different sign for δH, and are sometimes normalized by R(H) rather than R(0).

The term ""giant magnetoresistance"" indicates that the value δH for multilayer structures significantly exceeds the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which has a typical value within a few percent.

History
GMR was discovered in 1988 independently by the groups of Albert Fert of the University of Paris-Sud, France, and Peter Grünberg of Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. The practical significance of this experimental discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Fert and Grünberg in 2007.

Early steps
The first mathematical model describing the effect of magnetization on the mobility of charge carriers in solids, related to the spin of those carriers, was reported in 1936. Experimental evidence of the potential enhancement of δH has been known since the 1960s. By the late 1980s, the anisotropic magnetoresistance had been well explored, but the corresponding value of δH did not exceed a few percent. The enhancement of δH became possible with the advent of sample preparation techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, which allows manufacturing multilayer thin films with a thickness of several nanometers.

Experiment and its interpretation
Fert and Grünberg studied electrical resistance of structures incorporating ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials. In particular, Fert worked on multilayer films, and Grünberg in 1986 discovered the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in Fe/Cr films.

The GMR discovery work was carried out by the two groups on slightly different samples. The Fert group used (001)Fe/(001) Cr superlattices wherein the Fe and Cr layers were deposited in a high vacuum on a (001) GaAs substrate kept at 20 °C and the magnetoresistance measurements were taken at low temperature (typically 4.2 K). The Grünberg work was performed on multilayers of Fe and Cr on (110) GaAs at room temperature.

In Fe/Cr multilayers with 3-nm-thick iron layers, increasing the thickness of the non-magnetic Cr layers from 0.9 to 3 nm weakened the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe layers and reduced the demagnetization field, which also decreased when the sample was heated from 4.2 K to room temperature. Changing the thickness of the non-magnetic layers led to a significant reduction of the residual magnetization in the hysteresis loop. Electrical resistance changed by up to 50% with the external magnetic field at 4.2 K. Fert named the new effect giant magnetoresistance, to highlight its difference with the anisotropic magnetoresistance. The
Grünberg experiment made the same discovery but the effect was less pronounced (3% compared to 50%) due to the samples being at room temperature rather than low temperature.

The discoverers suggested that the effect is based on spin-dependent scattering of electrons in the superlattice, particularly on the dependence of resistance of the layers on the relative orientations of magnetization and electron spins. The theory of GMR for different directions of the current was developed in the next few years. In 1989, Camley and Barnaś calculated the ""current in plane"" (CIP) geometry, where the current flows along the layers, in the classical approximation, whereas Levy et al. used the quantum formalism. The theory of the GMR for the current perpendicular to the layers (current perpendicular to the plane or CPP geometry), known as the Valet-Fert theory, was reported in 1993. Applications favor the CPP geometry because it provides a greater magnetoresistance ratio (δH), thus resulting in a greater device sensitivity.

Theory

Fundamentals

Spin-dependent scattering

In magnetically ordered materials, the electrical resistance is crucially affected by scattering of electrons on the magnetic sublattice of the crystal, which is formed by crystallographically equivalent atoms with nonzero magnetic moments. Scattering depends on the relative orientations of the electron spins and those magnetic moments: it is weakest when they are parallel and strongest when they are antiparallel; it is relatively strong in the paramagnetic state, in which the magnetic moments of the atoms have random orientations.

For good conductors such as gold or copper, the Fermi level lies within the sp band, and the d band is completely filled. In ferromagnets, the dependence of electron-atom scattering on the orientation of their magnetic moments is related to the filling of the band responsible for the magnetic properties of the metal, e.g., 3d band for iron, nickel or cobalt. The d band of ferromagnets is split, as it contains a different number of electrons with spins directed up and down. Therefore, the density of electronic states at the Fermi level is also different for spins pointing in opposite directions. The Fermi level for majority-spin electrons is located within the sp band, and their transport is similar in ferromagnets and non-magnetic metals. For minority-spin electrons the sp and d bands are hybridized, and the Fermi level lies within the d band. The hybridized spd band has a high density of states, which results in stronger scattering and thus shorter mean free path λ for minority-spin than majority-spin electrons. In cobalt-doped nickel, the ratio λ↑/λ↓ can reach 20.

According to the Drude theory, the conductivity is proportional to λ, which ranges from several to several tens of nanometers in thin metal films. Electrons ""remember"" the direction of spin within the so-called spin relaxation length (or spin diffusion length), which can significantly exceed the mean free path. Spin-dependent transport refers to the dependence of electrical conductivity on the spin direction of the charge carriers. In ferromagnets, it occurs due to electron transitions between the unsplit 4s and split 3d bands.

In some materials, the interaction between electrons and atoms is the weakest when their magnetic moments are antiparallel rather than parallel. A combination of both types of materials can result in a so-called inverse GMR effect.

CIP and CPP geometries

Electric current can be passed through magnetic superlattices in two ways. In the current in plane (CIP) geometry, the current flows along the layers, and the electrodes are located on one side of the structure. In the current perpendicular to plane (CPP) configuration, the current is passed perpendicular to the layers, and the electrodes are located on different sides of the superlattice. The CPP geometry results in more than twice higher GMR, but is more difficult to realize in practice than the CIP configuration.

Carrier transport through a magnetic superlattice

Magnetic ordering differs in superlattices with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction between the layers. In the former case, the magnetization directions are the same in different ferromagnetic layers in the absence of applied magnetic field, whereas in the latter case, opposite directions alternate in the multilayer. Electrons traveling through the ferromagnetic superlattice interact with it much weaker when their spin directions are opposite to the magnetization of the lattice than when they are parallel to it. Such anisotropy is not observed for the antiferromagnetic superlattice; as a result, it scatters electrons stronger than the ferromagnetic superlattice and exhibits a higher electrical resistance.

Applications of the GMR effect require dynamic switching between the parallel and antiparallel magnetization of the layers in a superlattice. In first approximation, the energy density of the interaction between two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer is proportional to the scalar product of their magnetizations:

 

The coefficient J is an oscillatory function of the thickness of the non-magnetic layer ds; therefore J can change its magnitude and sign. If the ds value corresponds to the antiparallel state then an external field can switch the superlattice from the antiparallel state (high resistance) to the parallel state (low resistance). The total resistance of the structure can be written as

 

where R0 is the resistance of ferromagnetic superlattice, ΔR is the GMR increment and θ is the angle between the magnetizations of adjacent layers.

Mathematical description
The GMR phenomenon can be described using two spin-related conductivity channels corresponding to the conduction of electrons, for which the resistance is minimum or maximum. The relation between them is often defined in terms of the coefficient of the spin anisotropy β. This coefficient can be defined using the minimum and maximum of the specific electrical resistivity ρF± for the spin-polarized current in the form

 

where ρF is the average resistivity of the ferromagnet.

Resistor model for CIP and CPP structures
If scattering of charge carriers at the interface between the ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metal is small, and the direction of the electron spins persists long enough, it is convenient to consider a model in which the total resistance of the sample is a combination of the resistances of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers.

In this model, there are two conduction channels for electrons with various spin directions relative to the magnetization of the layers. Therefore, the equivalent circuit of the GMR structure consists of two parallel connections corresponding to each of the channels. In this case, the GMR can be expressed as

 

Here the subscript of R denote collinear and oppositely oriented magnetization in layers, χ = b/a is the thickness ratio of the magnetic and non-magnetic layers, and ρN is the resistivity of non-magnetic metal. This expression is applicable for both CIP and CPP structures. Under the condition  this relationship can be simplified using the coefficient of the spin asymmetry

 

Such a device, with resistance depending on the orientation of electron spin, is called a spin valve. It is ""open"", if the magnetizations of its layers are parallel, and ""closed"" otherwise.

Valet-Fert model
In 1993, Thierry Valet and Albert Fert presented a model for the giant magnetoresistance in the CPP geometry, based on the Boltzmann equations. In this model the chemical potential inside the magnetic layer is split into two functions, corresponding to electrons with spins parallel and antiparallel to the magnetization of the layer. If the non-magnetic layer is sufficiently thin then in the external field E0 the amendments to the electrochemical potential and the field inside the sample will take the form

 
 

where ℓs is the average length of spin relaxation, and the z coordinate is measured from the boundary between the magnetic and non-magnetic layers (z < 0 corresponds to the ferromagnetic). Thus electrons with a larger chemical potential will accumulate at the boundary of the ferromagnet. This can be represented by the potential of spin accumulation VAS or by the so-called interface resistance (inherent to the boundary between a ferromagnet and non-magnetic material)

 

where j is current density in the sample, ℓsN and ℓsF are the length of the spin relaxation in a non-magnetic and magnetic materials, respectively.

Device preparation

Materials and experimental data
Many combinations of materials exhibit GMR, and the most common are the following:

 FeCr
 Co10Cu90: δH = 40% at room temperature
 [110]Co95Fe5/Cu: δH = 110% at room temperature.

The magnetoresistance depends on many parameters such as the geometry of the device (CIP or CPP), its temperature, and the thicknesses of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. At a temperature of 4.2 K and a thickness of cobalt layers of 1.5 nm, increasing the thickness of copper layers dCu from 1 to 10 nm decreased δH from 80 to 10% in the CIP geometry. Meanwhile, in the CPP geometry the maximum of δH (125%) was observed for dCu = 2.5 nm, and increasing dCu to 10 nm reduced δH to 60% in an oscillating manner.

When a Co(1.2 nm)/Cu(1.1 nm) superlattice was heated from near zero to 300 K, its δH decreased from 40 to 20% in the CIP geometry, and from 100 to 55% in the CPP geometry.

The non-magnetic layers can be non-metallic. For example, δH up to 40% was demonstrated for organic layers at 11 K. Graphene spin valves of various designs exhibited δH of about 12% at 7 K and 10% at 300 K, far below the theoretical limit of 109%.

The GMR effect can be enhanced by spin filters that select electrons with a certain spin orientation; they are made of metals such as cobalt. For a filter of thickness t the change in conductivity ΔG can be expressed as

 

where ΔGSV is change in the conductivity of the spin valve without the filter, ΔGf is the maximum increase in conductivity with the filter, and β is a parameter of the filter material.

Types of GMR
GMR is often classed by the type of devices which exhibit the effect.

Films

Antiferromagnetic superlattices
GMR in films was first observed by Fert and Grünberg in a study of superlattices composed of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic layers. The thickness of the non-magnetic layers was chosen such that the interaction between the layers was antiferromagnetic and the magnetization in adjacent magnetic layers was antiparallel. Then an external magnetic field could make the magnetization vectors parallel thereby affecting the electrical resistance of the structure.

Magnetic layers in such structures interact through antiferromagnetic coupling, which results in the oscillating dependence of the GMR on the thickness of the non-magnetic layer. In the first magnetic field sensors using antiferromagnetic superlattices, the saturation field was very large, up to tens of thousands of oersteds, due to the strong antiferromagnetic interaction between their layers (made of chromium, iron or cobalt) and the strong anisotropy fields in them. Therefore, the sensitivity of the devices was very low. The use of permalloy for the magnetic and silver for the non-magnetic layers lowered the saturation field to tens of oersteds.

Spin valves using exchange bias
In the most successful spin valves the GMR effect originates from exchange bias. They comprise a sensitive layer, ""fixed"" layer and an antiferromagnetic layer. The last layer freezes the magnetization direction in the ""fixed"" layer. The sensitive and antiferromagnetic layers are made thin to reduce the resistance of the structure. The valve reacts to the external magnetic field by changing the magnetization direction in the sensitive layer relatively to the ""fixed"" layer.

The main difference of these spin valves from other multilayer GMR devices is the monotonic dependence of the amplitude of the effect on the thickness dN of the non-magnetic layers:

 

where δH0 is a normalization constant, λN is the mean free path of electrons in the non-magnetic material, d0 is effective thickness that includes interaction between layers. The dependence on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer can be given as:

 

The parameters have the same meaning as in the previous equation, but they now refer to the ferromagnetic layer.

Non-interacting multilayers (pseudospin valves)
GMR can also be observed in the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling layers. In this case, the magnetoresistance results from the differences in the coercive forces (for example, it is smaller for permalloy than cobalt). In multilayers such as permalloy/Cu/Co/Cu the external magnetic field switches the direction of saturation magnetization to parallel in strong fields and to antiparallel in weak fields. Such systems exhibit a lower saturation field and a larger δH than superlattices with antiferromagnetic coupling. A similar effect is observed in Co/Cu structures. The existence of these structures means that GMR does not require interlayer coupling, and can originate from a distribution of the magnetic moments that can be controlled by an external field.

Inverse GMR effect
In the inverse GMR, the resistance is minimum for the antiparallel orientation of the magnetization in the layers. Inverse GMR is observed when the magnetic layers are composed of different materials, such as NiCr/Cu/Co/Cu. The resistivity for electrons with opposite spins can be written as ; it has different values, i.e. different coefficients β, for spin-up and spin-down electrons. If the NiCr layer is not too thin, its contribution may exceed that of the Co layer, resulting in inverse GMR. Note that the GMR inversion depends on the sign of the product of the coefficients β in adjacent ferromagnetic layers, but not on the signs of individual coefficients.

Inverse GMR is also observed if NiCr alloy is replaced by vanadium-doped nickel, but not for doping of nickel with iron, cobalt, manganese, gold or copper.

GMR in granular structures
GMR in granular alloys of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metals was discovered in 1992 and subsequently explained by the spin-dependent scattering of charge carriers at the surface and in the bulk of the grains. The grains form ferromagnetic clusters about 10 nm in diameter embedded in a non-magnetic metal, forming a kind of superlattice. A necessary condition for the GMR effect in such structures is poor mutual solubility in its components (e.g., cobalt and copper). Their properties strongly depend on the measurement and annealing temperature. They can also exhibit inverse GMR.

Applications

Spin-valve sensors

General principle

One of the main applications of GMR materials is in magnetic field sensors, e.g., in hard disk drives and biosensors, as well as detectors of oscillations in MEMS. A typical GMR-based sensor consists of seven layers:

Silicon substrate,
Binder layer,
Sensing (non-fixed) layer,
Non-magnetic layer,
Fixed layer,
Antiferromagnetic (Pinning) layer,
Protective layer.

The binder and protective layers are often made of tantalum, and a typical non-magnetic material is copper. In the sensing layer, magnetization can be reoriented by the external magnetic field; it is typically made of NiFe or cobalt alloys. FeMn or NiMn can be used for the antiferromagnetic layer. The fixed layer is made of a magnetic material such as cobalt. Such a sensor has an asymmetric hysteresis loop owing to the presence of the magnetically hard, fixed layer.

Spin valves may exhibit anisotropic magnetoresistance, which leads to an asymmetry in the sensitivity curve.

Hard disk drives
In hard disk drives (HDDs), information is encoded using magnetic domains, and a change in the direction of their magnetization is associated with the logical level 1 while no change represents a logical 0. There are two recording methods: longitudinal and perpendicular.

In the longitudinal method, the magnetization is normal to the surface. A transition region (domain walls) is formed between domains, in which the magnetic field exits the material. If the domain wall is located at the interface of two north-pole domains then the field is directed outward, and for two south-pole domains it is directed inward. To read the direction of the magnetic field above the domain wall, the magnetization direction is fixed normal to the surface in the antiferromagnetic layer and parallel to the surface in the sensing layer. Changing the direction of the external magnetic field deflects the magnetization in the sensing layer. When the field tends to align the magnetizations in the sensing and fixed layers, the electrical resistance of the sensor decreases, and vice versa.

Magnetic RAM

A cell of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) has a structure similar to the spin-valve sensor. The value of the stored bits can be encoded via the magnetization direction in the sensor layer; it is read by measuring the resistance of the structure. The advantages of this technology are independence of power supply (the information is preserved when the power is switched off owing to the potential barrier for reorienting the magnetization), low power consumption and high speed.

In a typical GMR-based storage unit, a CIP structure is located between two wires oriented perpendicular to each other. These conductors are called lines of rows and columns. Pulses of electric current passing through the lines generate a vortex magnetic field, which affects the GMR structure. The field lines have ellipsoid shapes, and the field direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is determined by the direction of the current in the line. In the GMR structure, the magnetization is oriented along the line.

The direction of the field produced by the line of the column is almost parallel to the magnetic moments, and it can not reorient them. Line of the row is perpendicular, and regardless of the magnitude of the field can rotate the magnetization by only 90 °. With the simultaneous passage of pulses along the row and column lines, of the total magnetic field at the location of the GMR structure will be directed at an acute angle with respect to one point and an obtuse to others. If the value of the field exceeds some critical value, the latter changes its direction.

There are several storage and reading methods for the described cell. In one method, the information is stored in the sensing layer; it is read via resistance measurement and is erased upon reading. In another scheme, the information is kept in the fixed layer, which requires higher recording currents compared to reading currents.

Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is an extension of spin-valve GMR, in which the electrons travel with their spins oriented perpendicularly to the layers across a thin insulating tunnel barrier (replacing the non-ferromagnetic spacer). This allows to achieve a larger impedance, a larger magnetoresistance value (~10x at room temperature) and a negligible temperature dependence. TMR has now replaced GMR in MRAMs and disk drives, in particular for high area densities and perpendicular recording.

Other applications
Magnetoresistive insulators for contactless signal transmission between two electrically isolated parts of electrical circuits were first demonstrated in 1997 as an alternative to opto-isolators. A Wheatstone bridge of four identical GMR devices is insensitive to a uniform magnetic field and reacts only when the field directions are antiparallel in the neighboring arms of the bridge. Such devices were reported in 2003 and may be used as rectifiers with a linear frequency response.

24,328,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type7,"Jonathan Stevens Jackson (born May 11, 1982) is an American actor, musician, and author. He is best known for his role as Lucky Spencer in the television soap opera General Hospital (1993–2015), which won him five Daytime Emmy Awards. He is also known for his roles in the films The Deep End of the Ocean (1999), Tuck Everlasting (2002), Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004), and Riding the Bullet (2004), as well as the television series Nashville (2012–2018), for which he received a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination.

Early life
Jackson was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of Jeanine (née Sharp), an amateur ventriloquist and businesswoman, and Dr. Rick ""Ricky Lee"" Jackson, a family physician, country musician and Congressional candidate in the state of Washington. Jackson was raised in Battle Ground, Washington with his brother Richard Lee Jackson, now an actor and musician, and his sister Candice Jackson, now a lawyer, author, and official in the Trump administration. Jonathan attended Meadow Glade Elementary school.

In 1991, Jackson's family took a trip to Universal Studios Hollywood, where both Richard and Jonathan decided to pursue acting. The brothers took acting lessons in nearby Portland, Oregon, before moving part-time to Burbank, California with their mother in 1993. After doing various commercials, within six months Jackson won a role on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. Jackson continued his studies as he worked, graduating high school at age sixteen.

Career

Acting
Jackson's first notable role was Lucky Spencer on General Hospital, a role he first played from 1993 to 1999. Jackson won numerous awards for his work as Lucky. He was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series six times, winning first in 1995, and again in 1998 and 1999, making him the record holder for both nominations and wins for the Younger Actor category. He also won Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1995 and 1999. He was nominated for Young Artist Awards in 1996, 1997 and 1999. He won The Hollywood Reporter'''s YoungStar Award in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and was nominated in 2000. Jackson also became a popular ""teen heartthrob"" among fans, featured on fan magazines such as Tiger Beat and garnering many fan clubs and internet fansites. In 1999, he was named one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful people.

While working at General Hospital, Jackson starred in his first feature film Camp Nowhere, as Morris ""Mud"" Himmel in 1994. Also during this time he starred in made-for-television films Prisoner of Zenda, Inc. and The Legend of the Ruby Silver, and made a guest appearance during Season 5 of the ABC sitcom Boy Meets World. In 1999, Jackson filmed The Deep End of the Ocean shortly before leaving General Hospital, starring opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. Deep End director Ulu Grosbard spoke of Jackson as ""an enormously gifted actor. He brought a weight and a presence and chemistry with Michelle from the beginning. He's only 15 years old and he is a very serious actor who has both concentration and humor."" Pfeiffer added, ""When Jonathan and I read together, it was like he was my own son. And we just went at each other in only this way that a mother and son could do. His reading was exhilarating."" Jackson was nominated for YoungStar Awards in 1997 for Prisoner of Zenda, Inc. and 1999 for The Deep End of the Ocean.

In December 1999, Newsweek magazine reported Jackson was likely to be taking on the role of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones. However, he was soon dropped from the running, and publications speculated the prior publicity had hurt his chances due to creator George Lucas' preference for privacy. Jackson continued his film career in 2000 with the independent film True Rights and the ABC television movie Trapped in a Purple Haze. Jackson also wrote and directed a short film with his brother Richard entitled Crystal Clear, which won Best Dramatic Short Film and the Coen Brothers Award for Duo-Filmmaking at the Brooklyn Film Festival. In 2002, Jackson played one of his most well-known film roles as Jesse Tuck in Tuck Everlasting, which he filmed simultaneously with Insomnia. In 2004, Jackson filmed Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, and Riding the Bullet. From 2008 through 2009, he had a recurring role as Kyle Reese in the hit Fox TV show Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, playing the father of John Connor before the show was cancelled.

On September 29, 2009, it was announced that Jackson would return to General Hospital on October 27 to reprise the role of Lucky Spencer. In 2011, Jackson won his fourth Daytime Emmy and first Outstanding Supporting Actor Award. On November 7, 2011, it was announced that Jackson had decided to leave General Hospital and his final airdate was on December 23, 2011. His character is not planned to be recast or killed off, leaving the door open for Jackson to return with the show in the future. In 2012, Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy and second consecutive win for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

In 2012, he got the role of singer-songwriter Avery Barkley in the ABC drama Nashville. Along with the rest of the cast, Jonathan sang and played the guitar himself on the series.

Music

As a child, Jackson took guitar lessons and taught himself to play the piano. Growing up he had an evolving band with various family members. In 2000, the band included his brother, uncle and father and was named ""Scarlet Road"". By 2002, Jonathan and his brother Richard had named their group ""Jono and the Rock"".

The ensemble morphed into Enation, where Jackson is the frontman, playing guitar, vocals and writing most of the songs. Other band members include Jonathan's brother Richard (drums), and their friend Jonathan Thatcher (bass, previously of Delirious?)

The band has released several albums and their song ""Feel This"" became a Top 10 hit on the iTunes national Rock Charts after it was featured on the CW television drama series One Tree Hill. Enation's songs have also been featured on Riding the Bullet, and General Hospital.

As well as performing as singer, guitarist & piano Jackson also wrote the song ""The Morning of the Rain"" featured on episode 7 and 19 of the first season of Nashville. Enation have also landed on the Billboard Top 10 (Live From Nashville DVD, #9) and have garnered numerous radio and TV appearances including live performances on The View and VH1's Big Morning Buzz Live.

In June 2020, Jackson recorded a song dedicated to the Hilandar and Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Kosovo.

Books
In the spring of 2012, Jackson released a book of poetry under the pen name J. S. Jackson, titled Book of Solace and Madness. In June 2012, he discussed his yet-to-be-released book entitled Acting in the Spirit, which would discuss the connection between his Eastern Orthodox faith and his acting career. In November 2014, Jackson released The Mystery of Art: Becoming an Artist in the Image of God.

Personal life

Family
At age 20, Jackson married former General Hospital actress Lisa Vultaggio on June 21, 2002. Jackson told the Chicago Sun-Times, ""Some people thought we were a little young to get married. But we didn't see the need to wait. When it's right, it's right."" The couple moved to Jackson's hometown of Battle Ground, Washington, to raise their family. They have three children: Caleb (born June 21, 2003), Adora (born in the summer of 2005), and Titus Gabriel (born October 7, 2010).

Religion

The son of Seventh-day Adventist parents, Jackson was raised as a non-denominational Christian and has always been vocal about his faith. As part of his belief system, as a teen Jackson chose not to drink or do drugs. Jackson was also a proponent of abstinence from premarital sex. Jackson also often thanked God during his award acceptance speeches. While Jackson was working on General Hospital, he and his family held a home church in Burbank which various cast members attended, including Jackson's future wife Lisa Vultaggio. Jackson explained how his beliefs affected his choice of acting roles in an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 1999, ""I won't get involved with a movie that's a direct slap in the face of God. [...] I'm an actor, so I have to play people who believe differently than me. I would be willing to play a character that was completely unbelieving and anti-God, just as long as that wasn't the message of the whole movie."" In 2002, Jackson participated in the DKNY-sponsored ""What's Your Anti-Drug?"" campaign, posing for the 2003 calendar featured in Cosmogirl magazine, stating his anti-drug was faith.

In 2012, Jackson and his family were baptized into the Eastern Orthodox Church. Jackson cited a trip to Romania and Rome that first brought his attention to learning about the history of Christianity. In his acceptance speech for his 2012 Daytime Emmy Award, he thanked the Holy Trinity as well as the monks on Orthodox monastic enclave Mount Athos. Jackson later explained in an interview, ""These people [are] dedicating their lives to prayer, and not just praying for themselves, but truly praying for all of us. And then the thought kind of crossed my mind: with all the destruction, chaos and insanity that goes on in this world, if their prayers weren't happening, what would this world be like? I felt, personally, like I just wanted to thank them because I really believe that their prayers mean a lot.""

As of September 18, 2020, OrthoChristian.com reports that Jackson had moved to Ireland to help support a new monastery being founded by the Romanian Orthodox Metropolis of Southern and Western Europe. He explains in the interview, ""It’s the main reason I moved, I have been praying for years for an Orthodox monastery to be founded in Ireland.""

11,332,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type5,"Samuel Francis Adams (born September 3, 1963) is an American politician and non-profit leader who is the former mayor of Portland, Oregon. He grew up in Newport, Oregon, attended the University of Oregon and worked on a number of campaigns before taking office as a Portland commissioner. Among them was Vera Katz's run for mayor of Portland. After she won, he served as her chief of staff for eleven years and then went back to school, earning a degree in political science.

In 2004, Adams was elected to the Portland City Council, serving four years on the council earning a reputation as a ""policy-driven advocate for sustainability, the arts, and gay rights"". He was elected to a four-year term as mayor of Portland in the May 2008 primary, with 58% of the vote and a dozen other candidates on the ballot.  He was the first openly gay mayor of a top-30 U.S. city. In July 2011, Adams announced that he would not seek a second term as mayor. He had an approval rating of 56% eight months before he left office.

In 2021, he became Portland's director of strategic innovations for the office of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler.

Early life and education
Samuel Adams was born at St. James Hospital in Butte, Montana, on September 3, 1963. He is the third of four children born to Larry Adams—a special education teacher and high school basketball coach—and his wife, Karalie (née Gibbons). When Adams was born his family lived on ranch eight miles outside Whitehall, Montana. When he was a year old, his family moved to Richland, Washington, for a year, and then on to Newport, Oregon. His maternal grandfather Francis Gibbons immigrated from Ireland to Portland. Because of the Irish birth of his maternal grandfather, Adams holds dual Irish and American citizenship. In 1966, Adams and his family moved from Montana to the Oregon coast.

As a boy, Adams and his friends were almost always outside, rain or shine, fishing and crabbing off the cannery docks and digging for clams in the mudflats. ""The only thing that would bring him inside was food,"" said Adams' Mom.

When Adams was thirteen, his parents moved to Eugene, Oregon, where they divorced. Adams and his three siblings lived with their mother and survived at times on food stamps and public housing assistance. When his mother could not find work in Eugene in 1979 and moved to Portland, Adams stayed in Eugene, living largely on his own and supported himself working as a cook at a Mr. Steak restaurant throughout most of his high school years.

He graduated from high school in 1982, then started at the University of Oregon in 1984, but did not finish. Adams went back to college while working full time in 1999, at Portland State University. He graduated with a BA in political science in 2002 from the University of Oregon.

Summarizing his early life, the Willamette Week noted that Adams ""got a rough start in life. Not a lot of closeted, bullied, small-town welfare kids with divorced parents grow up to be the mayor of a major U.S. city. But unlike some politicians, Adams has not made his personal story a platform. His tough upbringing in Newport shapes his priorities.""

Career

Early career
Adams began his career in politics as a staffer on Peter DeFazio's 1986  campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in Oregon's 4th district. He dropped out of the University of Oregon to work on Peter DeFazio's successful bid for Congress. Not earning much, to save money, he'd sleep on a floor futon in the campaign headquarters."" After DeFazio won, Adams worked as a communications and policy assistant in his Oregon office, and on his re-election campaigns until 1988 when, Sam went to work for the Democratic House Campaign Committee, in Salem, Oregon and for Democratic Majority Leaders David Dix and Carl Hosticka.

Adams' first political position on his own came in 1988 when he was elected Chair of the Lane County (Oregon) Democratic Party. In 1990, Adams worked as the Oregon director for the highway safety organization Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways (CRASH). He next worked on Vera Katz's mayoral campaign in Portland and served eleven years as her Chief of Staff. He remained closeted at work until he became her Chief of Staff in 1993. He broke the news for the first time to a prospective employer to Mayor Vera Katz in 1992 after she offered him the job as her campaign manager, to which she replied 'Sweetie, I don't give a damn.'"" In discussing not disclosing his sexuality, Adams noted he came from a ""family of tough Montanans"" where ""there's a premium on being tough and strong, and being queer and a faggot wasn't strong"".

Portland City Council
In a 2004 election for a seat on the Portland City Council, Adams won significantly fewer votes than rival Nick Fish in the primary election, but defeated Fish in the general election. Following the primary, Adams shifted campaign managers and tactics from a focus on traditional fundraising to grassroots outreach.

Adams was Portland's Commissioner of Public Utilities. He ran the Portland Office of Transportation (commonly abbreviated as ""PDOT"") and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES). He also served as Portland City Council's liaison to the Arts and Culture and Small Business communities. As part of managing PDOT, he inherited the responsibility to oversee development of the Portland Aerial Tram, one of the world's few urban aerial trams. It links the South Waterfront district to the upper campus of Oregon Health & Science University. During its development, the project was plagued with cost overruns and opposition from some residents impacted by the project.  When Adams assumed responsibility, he replaced the external consultants responsible for the poor cost estimates with in-house expertise. The project was completed on time and within the revised budget with the tram opened to the public in January 2007.

Adams and his staff maintained a blog highlighting their activities in the community, especially pertaining to Adams' priorities such as arts and culture, livability and environment, and transportation.

2008 mayoral campaign

In October 2007 Adams announced his intentions to run for Mayor of Portland and kicked off his campaign at the Wonder Ballroom in Northeast Portland in February 2008. His main opponent was Sho Dozono, a civic leader and businessman, although 13 candidates filed for mayor. In the primary election, held May 20, 2008, Adams captured 58 percent of the vote and was elected without the need for a run-off. Dozono, his nearest opponent, received 34 percent of the vote. Adams took office on January 1, 2009. Portland became the largest U.S. city to have ever elected an openly gay mayor. (In December 2009 Houston, Texas, the nation's fourth largest city, elected Annise Parker, who is an out lesbian, surpassing Portland as the largest American city ever to have an openly gay mayor. Houston was the largest city to have elected an openly gay mayor until Lori Lightfoot was elected mayor of Chicago in 2019)

Mayoralty

In 2009, Adams in his inauguration speech said his top three priorities were creating more family-wage jobs, reducing the high school dropout rate, and making Portland more sustainable.

In his first State of the City address on February 27, 2009, Adams outlined his goal of making Portland ""the most sustainable city in the world"". Adams emphasized reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and investment in efficient green energy as essential to the city's energy-environmental goals and called on the Oregon State Legislature to provide incentives for the expansion of green energy companies, notably Vestas Wind Systems, into the Portland metropolitan area.

Later that year, Adams was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing related to a consensual sexual relationship with a young adult he met in 2005. Adams said the deception about the relationship was warranted because a political opponent had falsely accused him of having sex with a minor, but later apologized.

That year he also established a local economic stimulus plan by fast-tracking capital improvement projects, secured a Major League Soccer franchise, began work on the Oregon Sustainability Center established a free-bus-ride program designed to help low-income students more easily get to school, helped secure $2.5 million in new grants designed to help the city reduce diesel emissions, began construction of 15 miles of bike boulevards, and consolidated the city's permitting process.

Adams announced his support of new regulations for horse-drawn carriages in September 2009 after a horse died in downtown Portland a month earlier. Adams recommended that planners at the Revenue Bureau write new city codes that would cover working conditions for equine businesses and their animals.

In September 2009, he opposed the $4 billion, twelve-lane replacement for the I-5 bridge over the Columbia River, a plan he had once supported. Adams stated, ""I'd rather settle for a bad bridge for another 25 years than a terrible bridge that punishes Portland for another 100 years."" The twelve-lane idea was a compromise deal Adams helped write with then-Mayor Royce Pollard of Vancouver, Washington, in February, 2009. That deal helped get the Portland City Council to agree for a bridge of up to twelve lanes, something Vancouver wanted in exchange for its support of Portland's MAX Light Rail extension across the I-5 bridge. Adams focused on improving the local economy by attracting large, sustainable employers to Portland, including a $200-million investment by the company Vestas.

In 2010, Adams in his State of the City address was praised by environmental organizations and criticized by coal advocates for his successful efforts to shrink Portland's carbon footprint through programs such as Clean Energy Works, the nation's first on-bill financing for home retrofitting.  Adams also became known for leading the creation of Portland's ""Citizen Reports"" iPhone application.  He also appeared in Portlandia'''s second episode as Sam, assistant to the Mayor of Portland.

In November of that year, Adams fired the police chief and then fired a police officer who had shot and killed an unarmed citizen. He recruited a wind company to spend $66 million on development and hire 400 employees, established the city's first economic development plan, developed programs designed to reduce Portland's high school dropout rate and make the city more sustainable, and, along with the rest of the city council, adopted gun control regulations that are designed to reduce shootings.

In 2011, Adams established curbside composting, banned single-use plastic bags, adopted a transgender-inclusive health plan for city employees, recruited a photovoltaic company to move to and invest $340 million in infrastructure in Portland, recruited several TV and movie companies to do business and spend about $100 million on production in Portland, established the $2.1 million seed fund to help start-up businesses in Portland, supported Occupy Portland at first, but later dispersed the camps, and cracked down on gangs with a 14-month police undercover operation that resulted in the arrests of 31 gang members.

On July 29, 2011, Adams announced on his official city blog that he would not seek a second term as Portland's mayor.

Non-profit work
Just 16 days after expiration of his term as Mayor of Portland, Sam Adams was named as executive director of the City Club of Portland, a non-profit organization best known as the host of public civic policy meetings. After applying for the job in December 2012, Adams was selected from a pool of 80 applicants for the position, which paid him $80,000 in 2013.

Adams characterized his new position as a ""fantastic opportunity to do community building, work on improving the civic health of the city, and to support the members' work in researching tough public policy issues. Established in 1916, the City Club of Portland had about 1500 members and four paid employees in 2013. During his two-year tenure, City Club membership grew by 47 percent and corporate sponsorships doubled.

On January 14, 2014, Adams announced that he was leaving the City Club to become director of U.S. Climate Initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a global nonprofit dedicated to environmental sustainability. Adams moved to Washington, D.C. as a result.

In November of 2017, Adams was accused of sexual harassment by a former aide when he was mayor, and in December of 2017, he left his position at the World Resources Institute, although the allegations were not a factor in his choice to resign. The Willamette Week interviewed 10 staffers who were present at the time relating to the allegations and found ""none say they believe Adams had sexually harassed Gonzalez. Moreover, none recalled Gonzalez ever complaining about harassment.""

 Return to Portland 
In 2020, Adams returned to Portland and ran for City Council, but lost in the primary by about 2,000 votes. In 2021, he became the director of strategic innovations for mayor Ted Wheeler. In that job, he is currently leading efforts to clean up and revive the city after the coronavirus pandemic and protests.

Personal life
From 1992 until 2004, Adams was in a long-term relationship with Greg Eddie. During that time, in 1993, he was outed as gay by the alternative newspaper Willamette Week. In 2007, the former couple, in a challenge to the state constitution, filed suit against the State of Oregon to dissolve their domestic partnership and divide Adams' future pension. After his break-up with Eddie, Adams was, for the first time, both openly gay and single. Adams lamented his lack of ""gaydar"". He said this made him decide to date only men who asked him out first.

In 2005, Adams met Beau Breedlove, a 17-year-old interning for Oregon State Representative Kim Thatcher. In September 2007, Adams denied rumors of a sexual relationship between the two, calling the allegations scurrilous, and adding that they played into stereotypes of predatory gays. In January 2009, after being confronted with a story in Willamette Week, Adams acknowledged lying about the nature of their sexual relationship. Breedlove confirmed Adams' accounts. Adams apologized, saying he had lied to avoid accusations of grooming a minor and the likely disruption such allegations would cause in his mayoral campaign. Adams cited the ""swift public condemnation"" of former mayor and governor Neil Goldschmidt in 2004 by the news media as weighing heavily in his decision to lie. ""[N]o one's going to believe me [that he was eighteen]"". Oregon had already seen several prominent political sex scandals; prior to Goldschmidt's, there was one involving Senator Bob Packwood in 1992. The ""well-funded newsroom"" of The Oregonian had been criticized for failing to pursue both stories. In the Goldschmidt case, the Oregonian publicly debated with Willamette Week over which publication reported more accurately and aggressively. Adams also announced his intention to remain in office.

News of the deception led Oregon Attorney General John Kroger to initiate a criminal investigation in January 2009. By June, his office announced that no charges would be filed and that there was ""no credible evidence"" of inappropriate sexual contact before the age of consent. Before Kroger's findings were made public, several newspapers called for Adams' resignation. The Portland Mercury and the board of the Portland Area Business Association, the LGBTQ chamber of commerce, spoke out against resignation. Out magazine columnist Dan Savage noted what he saw as hypocrisy, homophobia, and sex panic about age disparity in sexual relationships. In July 2009 a recall campaign asserted that Adams had lost the trust of the public and other elected officials to ill effect on the city's economy. It fell short of gathering the necessary number of signatures.Willamette Week  ""Total Recall: Mayor Sam Adams' would-be recallers need to collect 358 valid signatures a day. Do they stand a chance?,"" by Allison Ferre (July 8th, 2009 – retrieved on July 16th, 2009). A second effort began in late 2009, with financial backing from over a dozen regional businesses. The backers posited that a ""lack of trust and political capital"" was affecting their businesses' bottom lines. However, it too failed due to lack of sufficient signatures.

Adams also dated Christopher Stowell, artistic director of Oregon Ballet Theatre. Adams met his partner Peter Zuckerman in 2008. Zuckerman is an American journalist and author who has focused his career on court reporting, investigative journalism, adventure stories, and socially progressive political campaigns.

Adams had a recurring role on the IFC show Portlandia as assistant to Portland's fictional mayor played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also appeared as himself in ""The Hour of Death"", a 2012 episode of the Portland-based NBC show Grimm''.

An open-source hardware device developed by Qi Hardware, it has been called possibly ""the world's smallest Linux laptop for the traditional definition of the word."". In addition, the Ben NanoNote is noteworthy for being one of the few devices on the market running entirely on copyleft hardware.

The computer takes its name from the Chinese character běn (本), translated as ""an origin or the beginning place.""

History 

Originally the hardware was developed by a third party as a digital dictionary. After the effort of several Qi Hardware developers, the design was freed as open source hardware while using free and open source software.

The product used to be manufactured by Qi hardware and Sharism At Work Ltd. As of 2011, more than 1,000 units had been sold.

Software 

The device is shipped with the OpenWrt software stack; the custom compilation includes a graphical menu called gmenu2x, with other graphical and command line applications available from the menu.

OpenEmbedded is also available through the Jlime distribution. The Pyneo software stack, a Debian-like distribution aimed for mobiles has been ported. The MIPS architecture port of Debian Linux can be run on the NanoNote. Additionally there is NanoNixOS, a cross-compiled distribution based on the Nix package manager.

Reception

After the 2010 introduction of the Ben NanoNote, reviewers praised its small size and low cost (US$99), but also criticized the device for its initial lack of any networking capability and for its extremely modest data storage and RAM capabilities in comparison to other contemporary devices.

Product development 

Because the device lacked wireless connectivity, implementing this was one of the first goals for the Qi Hardware movement. This add-on, the Ben WPAN, was developed by Werner Almesberger, and mainly consists of an IEEE 802.15.4 subsystem, made up of two boards: a USB dongle (ATUSB) connected to the computer and another card connected to the SDIO port of the device (ATBEN).

All source code, documentation and test procedures, software and hardware schematics are available under copyleft licenses.

UBB, or Universal Breakout Board, is a PCB shaped like a microSD card, focused on DIY projects and general purpose interfacing using the available MMC/SDIO port.

So far two hacks had been published: one of them, the integration with a 443 MHz RF transceiver for power sockets control purposes and later a mix of bit banging and SDIO/DMA features turning the SD card slot into a VGA port.

As the Ben NanoNote uses an Ingenic JZ4720 processor it supports booting from USB without use of the NAND flash memory.

Derivatives 

The SIE board is an adaptation of the NanoNote. It has twice the memory and features a XC3S Xilinx FPGA on board. It is based on the XBurst JZ4725 SoC, which has more I/O pins available due to not having a keyboard.

22,336,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type6,"Thomas E. Brennan (May 27, 1929 – September 29, 2018) was an American attorney, jurist, and academic administrator who was the founder of Thomas M. Cooley Law School and the 81st Justice and Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.

Early life and education
Brennan was born in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from the private Detroit Catholic Central High School, where he excelled in forensics. He attended the University of Detroit and earned a law degree from the University of Detroit Law School in 1952.

Career

Campaigns and legal practice 
He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Michigan House of Representatives from the Wayne County 1st District in 1952 and from the 6th District in 1954. In December 1955, he was the Republican Party candidate in the special election for the U.S. representative from Michigan's 15th congressional district to fill the seat of John Dingell Sr., who had died in office. Brennan lost to Dingell's son, John Dingell Jr.

In 1953, he joined the law firm of Waldron, Brennan, Brennan, and Maher, with whom he worked until 1961, when he was elected to a seat on the Common Pleas Bench. In 1963, he was appointed by Michigan Governor George W. Romney to the Wayne County Circuit Bench, and in 1964 he was elected to that same position.

Michigan Supreme Court
In 1966, at the urging of Governor Romney, Brennan, sought the nomination of the Republican Party as Associate Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Brennan won the nomination, and the election. In 1969 and 1970, Brennan served as Chief Justice, the youngest Justice to serve in that capacity.

Thomas M. Cooley Law School
During his service on the Bench, Brennan received many requests for law school recommendations. This was the basis of his vision for a new, private, law school in Lansing, Michigan. In 1972, he incorporated the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. Brennan left the Supreme Court on December 6, 1973, to dedicate his professional career to the newly formed law school. Brennan served as first Dean of Cooley Law School until 1978, when he became its first president.

Later career
Brennan was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Senator from Michigan in 1976, losing to Marvin L. Esch in the Republican primary election. In 1982, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, losing to Democrat Martha W. Griffiths in the general election.

Judging the Law Schools
Judging the Law Schools is a law school ranking using only American Bar Association (ABA) data, first published in 1996. The rankings, also known as the Brennan rankings, are compiled and published by Brennan. They measure objective American Bar Association (ABA) statistics such as first time bar passage rates, course offerings, LSAT scores, tuition cost, academic facilities, employment, applicants, student and faculty diversity, as well as twenty other objective measures used by the ABA. Judging the Law Schools does not poll perceived reputation as do commercial publications such as U.S. News rankings, and no one statistic is weighted more than 3% in Cooley's ranking system. Because large schools tend to be ranked higher in Judging the Law Schools due to wider course offerings, greater numbers of applicants, and larger academic facilities, critics have alleged that the rankings favor larger institutions such as Cooley. 

Cooley relies heavily on its library statistics in its own ""Judging the Law School"" rankings. Specifically, Cooley has 10 library-based statistics in its 2010 rankings, which included separate entries for the total square footage in the library, the seats available in the library, the number of hours the library is open, the total number of volumes in the library, the total number of titles in the library, the number of librarians, the total hours that staff works in the library, and several other library-based criteria. Cooley has been subject to intense criticism and backlash for assigning equal value of these library-based statistics to far more important factors such as bar passage rate and percentage of graduates employed following graduation.

Personal life 
In 1951, he married Pauline M. Weinberger, with whom he had six children. He died in Lansing, Michigan on September 29, 2018.

46,339,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type1,"Tochitsukasa Tetsuo (born 25 April 1958 as Tetsuo Goto) is a former sumo wrestler from Nakagawa, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. His highest rank was sekiwake. He is now the head coach of Irumagawa stable.

Career
A former amateur champion at Nihon University, he turned professional at the age of 23, joining Kasugano stable in March 1981. He reached the top makuuchi division in September 1983, and in 1984 he earned his first special prize for Fighting Spirit, and defeated Takanosato in his first ever bout against a yokozuna to earn his first of his three kinboshi. He spent most of 1985 in the second jūryō division, but in 1986 made the san'yaku ranks at komusubi. In November 1987 he scored 10–5 from the maegashira 6 ranking, defeating two ōzeki and winning the Technique Prize. This earned him promotion to his highest rank of sekiwake for the following tournament in January 1988. However, by the end of the year he was in jūryō again due to injury problems. He won the jūryō yūshō on two occasions in 1989 and won promotion back to the top division. After missing the September 1990 tournament he fell to jūryō again and made only one more appearance in makuuchi before retiring in May 1992 at the age of 34.

Retirement from sumo
He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Irumagawa Oyakata, and established Irumagawa stable in 1993. His wrestlers Yotsukasa and Otsukasa both reached the top division in 1999, and they were followed by Masatsukasa in 2008 and Sagatsukasa in 2010.

Fighting style
A powerful and versatile wrestler, Tochitsukasa preferred tsuki/oshi or pushing and thrusting techniques rather than fighting on the mawashi. His favourite kimarite were oshi-dashi (push out) and tsuki otoshi (thrust over). However he also regularly won by yori-kiri (force out), and was also capable of pulling off throws, both overarm (uwatenage) and underarm (shitatenage).

Trivia
He had a crowd-pleasing quirk of always staying in a squat position for much longer than normal and rocking back and forth before returning to his corner during the shikiri, or warm-up phase of a match.

64,343,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type9,"'Warming up' is a part of stretching and preparation for physical exertion or a performance by exercising or practicing gently beforehand, usually undertaken before a performance or practice. Athletes, singers, actors and others warm up before stressing their muscles. It is widely believed to prepare the muscles for vigorous actions and to prevent muscle cramps and injury due to overexertion.

Exercise

A warm-up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a ""pulse raiser""), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, athletes might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm-ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.

Stretching

Stretching is part of some warm-up routines, although a study in 2013 indicates that it weakens muscles in that situation. There are 3 types of stretches: ballistic, dynamic, and static:

 Ballistic Stretches involve bouncing or jerking. It is purported to help extend limbs during exercise, promoting agility and flexibility.
 Static Stretches involve flexing the muscles. This may help prevent injury and permit greater flexibility and agility. Note that static stretching for too long may weaken the muscles.
 Dynamic Stretching involves moving the body part in the desired way until reaching the full range of motion, to improve performance.

Warming up in other contexts
Psychologists, educators, singers, and similar professionals use warm-ups in therapeutic or learning sessions before starting or after a break; these warm-ups can include vocal and physical exercises, interactive and improvisational games, role plays, etc. A vocal warm-up can be especially important for actors and singers.

Benefits

Preventing injury 
There has been contradictory evidence in terms of benefits of comprehensive warm-ups for preventing injury in football (soccer) players, with some studies showing some benefit while other showing no benefit. It has been suggested that it is specifically warm ups aimed at increasing body temperature, rather than targeting stretching, which can prevent injury. Warming up before an eccentric exercise has been shown to reduce the severity of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

Increasing performance 
In baseball, warm-up swings using a standard weight bat are effective in increasing batting speed. In a 2010 meta-analysis, the authors concluded that in about four-fifths of the studies there was improvement in performance with various physical activities with warm-ups as opposed to without warm-ups. An increase in body temperature, specifically in the muscles, improves explosive skeletal muscle performance (e.g., jumping and sprinting).

Gianmarco Cavagnino is the founder of storymoving®, a narrative approach to design, which manifesto explains the importance of witnessing authentic stories and sharing them through projects. Gianmarco Cavagnino follows this philosophy in every work and aims to share it and create a new generation of professional storymovers who are moved and operate with this method. For this reason he is the author of the workshop “designing happyness 2020” in parnership with DDN (Design Diffusion News magazine) and Festival della Crescita, intended for professionals in the design and architecture field.

In 2021 he took part and wins the urban contest “I Viali di Canelli” in Canelli, Piedmont, an ideas competition focus on the territory, the communication and the relationship with nature.

In 2021 he realized and achieved the artistic direction of the project Piemonte Home Design, to express the piemontese design and craftsmanship on international markets, in collaboration with the Torino and Italy-Russia's Chamber of Commerce.

53,346,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type8,"Modern Swedish () is the linguistic term used for the Swedish language from the Bible translation of 1526 to the development of a common national language around 1880. The period can further be divided into Early Modern Swedish (1526–1750) and Late Modern Swedish (1750–1880).

Early Modern Swedish

Bible
Early Modern Swedish was established in 1526 with a complete Swedish translation of the Bible. The translation followed the spoken word rather closely, as opposed to the more Latin-inspired way of writing commonly used in the Middle Ages. 

The Vasa Bible is considered  to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the spoken language of its day it was not overly conservative in its use of old forms. Though it was not completely consistent in spelling, particularly when it came to vowels, it was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography. It established the use of the letters ""ä"" and ""ö"" in place of the older ""æ"" and ""ø"" and introduced the completely new ""å"" in place of ""o"" in many words. It also introduced conventions such as using ck instead of kk in words like tacka; ""thank"". The ongoing rivalry with Denmark can be argued to have some influence on the new translation, with infinitive suffixes like -a being favored over the -e more typical of Danish. While the influence of individual translators should not be exaggerated, the fact that all three came from provinces in central Sweden (Andreæ was from Västmanland and the Petri brothers were from Närke) is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible as well as the fact that the royal printing house was situated in Stockholm. Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent in the following century. It was not until the end of the 17th century that the issue started being discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into  and the softening of /g/ and /k/ into /ʝ/ and  before frontal vowels.

The 16th century was further marked by inconsistencies in the Swedish language throughout the country. Some regions did not adhere to the standards the Bible used and continued to use their old way of writing. Books printed in Swedish were scarce. Most were theological texts intended to spread the Lutheran doctrines through Sweden.

Also of importance were the national hymnals. A first draft was created in the 1530s. These set the mark for young people as they sang the hymns in Church.

17th century
In the 17th century there were attempts to establish Swedish as a genuine language. An early linguist and author was Georg Stiernhielm, who is today almost universally labelled ""Father of Swedish Poetry"". He was the first to introduce the hexameter into the Swedish language with his epic Hercules in 1658. The hexameter is used in the Latin language and is sometimes considered unsuitable for  Germanic languages because of the differences in prosody. However, it had been adapted to German and English more than a century earlier with the alternating long and short syllables of Latin being replaced with stressed and unstressed syllables of the Germanic languages. The hexameter would later be used by many other Swedish poets.

Stiernhielm was a learned man, and has been labelled the most knowledgeable man in Sweden of his time. He was probably the first to be so fascinated by the Norse languages, and spent much labor tracing the similarities between Icelandic and old Swedish. Realizing the common inheritance they shared, he traced their origin from ancient times, descending them from a Biblical tribe.

Late Modern Swedish
Late Modern Swedish is considered to have begun in 1732 when Olof von Dalin published the weekly publication ""The Swedish Argus"" in Stockholm. It dealt with current events in Sweden, mainly Stockholm with its population of 50,000, in a publicly appealing way. Often it used irony and satire to portray royalty and other notable people.

This popular style characterizes the entire period. Bellman was a Stockholm poet of the late 18th century whose poetry represented the drinking habits of the time.

In 1825 a professor of Lund University and later Bishop of Växjö, Esaias Tegnér, published Fritiof's Saga, a Viking epic directed to a general audience. It gained great popularity and was later set to music and sung in the homes of the Swedish middle class. It was reprinted several times in the 19th century, up until the 1880s when the newer realistic poetry set the mark with names such as Strindberg.

19th century in SwedenVickers, da Costa was a prominent stockbroking firm of the London Stock Exchange in the City of London, and later also of the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It was in business from its creation in 1917 until 1986, when after a takeover by Citicorp it was merged into a new firm called Scrimgeour Vickers. In 1987, this was closed.

Origins
The firm's founder was (Horace) Cecil Vickers (1882-1944), who had started work in the office of a Licensed Broker in 1895, shortly before his 13th birthday. He became a partner in the well-known stockbroking firm of Nelke, Phillips & Bendix of Throgmorton Street, which dealt for King Edward VII. The firm had been prominent in the mining share market in the 1890s.

In 1917, during the First World War, the Committee for General Purposes of the Stock Exchange received objections to the re-election of certain members 'of enemy origin', and Paul Nelke of Nelke, Phillips was deemed to be such a person. This precipitated the partners and staff of that firm to seek other ways of undertaking stockbroking business, and a new firm called Vickers, da Costa was founded by Horace Cecil Vickers, Reginald Vickers, David Nunes da Costa (descended from a prominent Hamburg Sephardi family) and JH Millns. 
 The firm had its offices at 1, Throgmorton Street in the City of London.  Jack Churchill, the brother of Winston Churchill, had also been a partner of Nelke, Phillips and thus he joined the new firm, being made a partner in 1921. As a consequence, the investment activities of the future prime minister were channeled through the firm. Nelke, Phillips did not come to an end, being converted into a merchant bank.

In 1938, the firm split when the Strauss brothers departed the partnership to form Strauss, Turnbull & Company (which would be bought by Societe Generale in 1986). As a result Vickers, da Costa was left with eight partners.

Ralph Cecil Vickers, born on 14 November 1913, the son of Horace Vickers, was on the staff of Vickers da Costa from 1935–39 and again from 1944 to 1981. He was Senior Partner, 1961-1972, and then Chairman until 1981. He led the firm during its period of prominence, growing it to having over 700 employees, with offices in London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, New York, Los Angeles, Luxembourg, Monte Carlo, and the Bahamas. It was said that 'the sun never set on Vickers, da Costa'. The firm was also a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. John Clay was the deputy chairman during the latter part of Ralph Vickers's term. He would later leave to found the New York-based asset manager, Clay Finlay.

Sir Kenneth Berrill, the former head of the Think Tank, succeeded him as chairman in 1981.

For most of the post-war period its offices were at Regis House on King William Street. When the firm proposed this move in 1955, it needed the approval of the Stock Exchange to be ""so far away"" from the Exchange floor.

Merger & End
In the mid-1980s on the eve of London's Big Bang deregulation of the London Stock Exchange, Citibank acquired stakes in the member firms of Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee and Vickers da Costa, merging them into  a new entity called Scrimgeour Vickers. In the difficult trading environment in the wake of the Crash of 1987, Citicorp resolved to close the businesses and the names of the firms ceased to do business.

During the Finnish Civil War, in winter 1918, the Finnish air force used Kolho as a base. Kolho has influenced a number of Finnish artists ranging from Eero Järnefelt, Akseli Gallen-Kallela to Pentti Saarikoski and also was the site of the worst church boat accident in Finnish history.  Kolho played a role in the rise of the Finnish paper industry together with the neighbouring Mänttä community. More recently Kolho is known for its natural environment and is a summer resort destination.

James Vehko (aka Jalmari Vehkomäki), the designer of the first Ford's metallic automobile chassis, was originally from Kolho.

History
The company was incorporated in 1899 as a subsidiary of the American Steel and Wire Company, a steel firm with several plants scattered throughout Cleveland. Construction began that year, and was complete in 1904. The line ran from the company's Central Furnaces (the area roughly bounded today by the Cuyahoga River, Interstate 490, and Broadway Avenue) and ran briefly south before crossing the Cuyahoga River at the now-demolished Jefferson Avenue Bridge. The track ran through the company's plant on the west side of the Cuyahoga, and recrossed the river near the now-demolished Clark Avenue Bridge. The line ran south (passing over Campbell Road and under Harvard Avenue) before turning east. After an at-grade crossing of E. 49th Street and the bridging of E. 71st Street, the tracks turned north at E. 76th Street into the company Newburgh Works, terminating at Aetna Road.

American Steel and Wire merged with a number of other steel companies to form U.S. Steel in 1901. U.S. Steel consolidated the NSR with another subsidiary railroad, the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad, in 1951. Traffic on the road declined significantly after World War II, and largely ceased when U.S. Steel closed its Cuyahoga Works in 1984. The NSR sold  of its main line to the Cuyahoga Valley Railway, and then closed on June 30, 1986.

In July 1986, the track was sold to the Chicago West Pullman Transportation Co., now known as Omnitrax.

Rail transportation in ClevelandThe Englynion y Beddau () is a Middle Welsh verse catalogue listing the resting places (beddau) of legendary heroes. It consists of a series of englynion, or short stanzas in quantitative meter, and survives in a number of manuscripts. The collection is thought to be considerably older than its earliest manuscript, the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen, and provides an important early glimpse at medieval Welsh heroic tradition and topographical folklore.

Transmission
The stanzas, or more specifically, englynion, are transmitted in four classes of medieval Welsh manuscripts and later transcripts. The earliest, best known and most reliable version of the text is the collection of 73 englynion preserved in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The first 69 stanzas were copied in the first quarter of the 13th century, while the last four were added at a later stage, probably in the same century. Five further englynion survive as part of the poetic cycles of Heledd and Llywarch Hen in the Red Book of Hergest and two transcripts, supposedly from the White Book of Rhydderch, made in the decades on both sides of 1600: BL, Additional MS 31055 and Peniarth MS 111. The third significant group is represented by Dr John Davies' copy in NLW Peniarth 98(B) and a number of manuscripts which appear to go back to a 16th-century manuscript, now lost. It contains 18 stanzas in corrupt form, some of which are alternative versions of the englynion in the Black Book of Carmarthen. Finally, there is a single englyn milwr preserved in Wrexham MS 1 and still later manuscripts.

Although the earliest extant manuscript dates to the 13th century, much of the material is thought to be considerably earlier. According to Thomas Jones, the language, style and metre of the verses suggests a date of composition somewhere in the 9th or 10th century. Likewise, Jenny Rowlands has dated some of the stanzas contained in the Black Book text to the 9th century.

Form and structure
The core of the text in the Black Book of Carmarthen is made up by the englynion which employ either of two basic opening formulas. The first of these formulas is Y bedd ""The grave"" (33x), or variants thereof, such as Y beddau (6x) and (Y) tri bedd (2x). The other takes the form of a question, Pieu y bedd…? ""Whose is the grave…?"" (18x), usually followed by an answer identifying the name of the hero who lies in the grave. A further 13 stanzas deviate from this pattern and they may be regarded as additions which derive from other sources, though some are part of a series which contains one of these set formulas. In the standard edition of the work by Thomas Jones, they are given as stanzas 7 (not an englyn), 14-15 (on Owain and Cynddylan), 19 (part of 17-19, on Meigen son of Rhun), 30 (part of 28-30, on graves at a site called Gwanas), 37-38 (on Beid(d)awg Rudd), 42-43 (presumably uttered by the legendary Taliesin), 41 (on Cynddylig son of Corcnud), 47 (part of 46-7, on Eiddew and Eidal, sons of Meigen), 62 (on Bradwen) and 64.

A single englyn may describe up to three different heroes. Place-names are often absent and when described, the grave-sites may assume a variety of locations - in mountainous, hilly or flat landscapes, near waterways or churches, and even in the sea. The verses occasionally refer to the physical condition of the graves, such as wetness and growth of moss.

Themes and contents
With the exception of the four women mentioned in stanza 70, the names of the dead belong to male heroes of Welsh legend (rather than history). They receive high praise for the virile strength and prowess they have shown in battle, such as Dehewaint, a ""strong pillar of warriors"". Although the dominant tone remains one of heroic celebration, the eulogies are also touched with a hint of sadness for the inevitability of death, as expressed in the gnomic statement that ""each one's death comes at the fated time"" (stanza 64).

Like the Trioedd Ynys Prydein or Welsh Triads, the work is valuable for offering numerous glimpses of Welsh heroic tradition. These are embedded in snippets of topographic folklore, which ""[testify] to the close association between heroes and places in early Welsh literature"".

The work is famous for containing an early allusion to King Arthur, whose grave is said to be one of the mysteries of the world (anoeth byd). References or possible allusions to Bedwyr, Gwalchmai and the Battle of Camlann also testify to some absorption of Arthurian tradition in the text, though the work has little in common with the earliest Welsh Arthurian tale, Culhwch ac Olwen.

There are also references to characters known from the Middle Welsh prose tales of the Mabinogi. The Dylan of stanza 4, whose grave is said to be near the church of St Beuno (i.e. at Clynnog Fawr), appears to be the Dylan Eil Ton (""son of Wave"") who occurs in the Fourth Branch. Another Mabinogi character is Pryderi, of whom the Fourth Branch tells that he was slain and buried at Maen Tyriawg, above the Felenrhyd. Stanza 7 locates his grave at the confluence of the Gwenoli, which is where the stream meets the Felenrhyd. The relation between the grave of Lleu Llaw Gyffes ""under cover of the sea, / where his disgrace was, / a man who spared no one"" (stanza 35) and the account of his death in the Fourth Branch is uncertain and it may be that the englyn alludes to a somewhat different story.

At the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario he won the six mile race with a time of 30:49.6 mins, despite stopping over the finish line after what he thought was the last lap and being told that there was a lap to go. The official had inadvertently turned over two discs instead of one. He beat Ernie Harper from England. In the three mile race (equivalent to 5000 meters) he did not finish.

At the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles he finished fourth in both the 5000 metre event and the 10000 metre competition.

He did not compete in the national championships in 1935 and 1936 as he was working as a stonemason and could not spend the necessary time training, but competed against two Japanese runners who were visiting New Zealand in 1937. Like Malcolm Champion before him he was then for some years Custodian at Auckland's Tepid Baths.

The game mechanics are essentially the same as Pong or air hockey, where players continuously shoot the disc at the goal zone of the opponent attempting to score. The game can be played against the computer or in a 2 player versus. Dotemu ported the game to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2017, Nintendo Switch in October 2018, and iiRcade in February 2021. Dotemu would later develop and publish a sequel, Windjammers 2, which was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC and Google Stadia on January 20, 2022.

Gameplay

Players choose from one of six playable characters, each with their own unique speed/power ratings and special throws. Players maneuver around their respective sides of the court in any of the eight cardinal directions (allowing for almost fluid movement in any direction). They must act as the defense and offense of their side, blocking the disc from entering the goal zone, and throwing the disc back to the opponent's side in an attempt to score. Players throw the disc back and forth (with the speed of the disc generally increasing with each throw) until one of them scores a point, which causes the disc to be reset by the referee, who throws it to the player who was scored on so that they can serve. There are yellow goal zones, worth three points when hit by the disc, and red goal zones, worth five points. In addition, failing to catch the disc while it is in the air (described below) is considered a ""Miss"" and gives two points to the opponent. Each of the six court types varies in the size and positioning of the goal zones.

While the opponent holds the disc, the player acts defensively by trying to grab the disc and therefore stopping it from entering their goal zone. In order to stop the disc, the player simply needs to make contact with it, by either walking into it or diving for it with a button press (which is done at almost all times due to the high speeds of the disc). Sometimes, the disc may be launched into the air, due to the opponent, the net, barriers, or sometimes bouncing off the player's back, in which a target will appear on the court showing the landing spot of the disc, which can be caught by standing on said target.

While the player holds the disc, they act offensively by trying to throw it into the goal zone of the opponent. The player cannot move while holding the disc, and cannot hold it for more than a few seconds. The player points with the joystick in the desired direction to throw the disc and presses the primary button. The player can throw it either directly at the opponent's goal zone or attempt to bounce the disc off the walls, or barriers (if in a court that contains them).

When playing against computer opponents, the player plays one match against each character (with the next character's difficulty increasing each time) until all are defeated, thus winning the game. When playing 2-player versus, one match is played between the two players. A match consists of 3 sets that last 30 seconds by default and up to 99 seconds on the arcade version (with the timer not stopping when a point is scored, unlike most sports). A set ends when either a player reaches 12 points (in which case that player wins the set) or 30 seconds have elapsed (after which the player with the most point wins the set). If the set ends in a tie, a set win is given to both players. A match is won by winning two sets, but if players tie in both of the first two sets (giving each of them two wins), the game enters a sudden death round in which the first player to score in any way wins the match.

Characters 
The playable characters are listed below.

Ports
On June 22, 2010, the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Following the bankruptcy of Data East, the intellectual rights for this game were acquired by Paon DP, a company which hiring some of ex-Data East employees and also having developed some of Neo Geo Pocket Color titles for SNK (such as SNK Gals' Fighters). It was delisted from the Virtual Console on December 24, 2013, making it the only delisted Neo-Geo game for the Virtual Console.

A port of the game with online multiplayer support was released by DotEmu for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on August 29, 2017, with a Nintendo Switch version on October 23, 2018.

Reception 

In North America, the April 1994 issue of RePlay reported Windjammers to be the fourteenth most-popular arcade game at the time. The July 1994 issue of Play Meter later listed it as the nineteenth most-popular arcade game at the time.

In Japan, Game Machine listed Windjammers on their May 1, 1994 issue as being the twenty-second most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as Samurai Shodown. According to Famitsu, the Neo Geo CD version sold over 4,307 copies in its first week on the market.

Retrospective reviews 

Video game website Giant Bomb began regularly playing the game on camera in 2013, eventually giving it their ""Old Game of the Year"" award. The same website later classified the game as a runner-up for ""2017's Old Game of the Year"" at the Game of the Year 2017 Awards.

The game has also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to a growing competitive scene. In 2018, it appeared at the Evolution Championship Series (EVO) annual fighting game championships in Las Vegas as a side tournament.

Virtual Console gamesThe Mercedes D.III, or F1466 as it was known internally, was a six-cylinder, SOHC valvetrain liquid-cooled inline aircraft engine built by Daimler and used on a wide variety of German aircraft during World War I. The initial versions were introduced in 1914 at 160 hp, but a series of changes improved this to 170 hp in 1917, and 180 by mid-1918. These later models were used on almost all late-war German fighters, and its only real competition, the BMW III, was available only in very limited numbers. Compared to the Allied engines it faced, the D.III was generally outdated.

Design and development
The D.III was based on the same pattern as the earlier Mercedes D.II, suitably scaled up for higher power settings. Like most inlines of the era, it used a large aluminum crankcase as the main structural component, with separate cylinders made from steel bolted onto it. The technology for screwing a threaded cylinder of steel into an aluminum crankcase did not exist at that time. Jackets for cooling water covered the top 2/3 of the cylinder, feeding a radiator via connections at the back of the engine. The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders.

The D.III featured a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single intake and exhaust valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft at the rear of the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The ignition cables were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.

Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.

Production variants

The original D.III was introduced in 1914. While it saw widespread use in early examples of the C-series of two-seat general-purpose biplanes, the D.III was too large for contemporary fighter designs and did not see use in that role. At the time, fighters were generally powered by lighter rotary engines of power output levels from 80 to about 110 hp, or by water-cooled inline engines in the 100 to 120 hp range such as the earlier Mercedes D.II. By 1916 new designs had grown in size and performance and the D.III became popular on new designs. By 1917 the D.III was being widely used in fighters, most notably on the famous Albatros D.I. Production of this version was essentially wound down by May 1917, with only a handful continuing to be delivered until October. British HP ratings being slightly different (with 746 watts = 1 hp) to the German PS or Pferdestärke standard of roughly 735 watts per PS horsepower, it is probable that this engine would have had a slightly higher rating under British HP numbers.  Fuel consumption was 11.75 gallons per hour.  Its compression ratio was 4.5:1.

Development of the basic design led to the slightly modified 170 hp D.IIIa, which took over on the production lines in June 1917. The main change was to change the piston profile to have a flat head instead of the former concave one, thereby slightly increasing maximum compression to 4.64:1. Other changes were mainly in design details, notably a redesigned crankcase and new carburetor. Many of the accessories were also redesigned or moved around on the engine. This model was produced only briefly, for use on the Albatros D.III but there are indications that possibly some early Albatros (Alb.) made Fokker D.VII's were also equipped but probably had the engines upgraded or replaced as quickly as possible.  This engine has been referred to in postwar British analysis as generating 180 hp.

A more ""radical"" upgrade was the 180/200 hp D.IIIaü, introduced in late 1917, the D.IIIaü was a standardized refinement of the D.III and D.IIIa design and the ü designation was never official. This engine changed the pistons again, this time to a domed profile that further increased the maximum compression – the ü was for ""über"", meaning ""overcompressed"". Additionally, a new altitude-compensating carburetor was added, which improved performance at higher altitudes. To support operations at these altitudes, water from the radiator was used to heat the air intake and prevent icing in the carburetor. The aü model, which included upgraded D.III and D.IIIa engine blocks, was the most prolific German fighter engine of 1918 and designed into most fighter designs from late 1917 on. This included most of the entries in the First Fighter Competition at Adlershof in January 1918, notably the famed Fokker D.VII. In British post war evaluation the D.IIIaü demonstrated 200 hp according to the British standards.

A final version attempting to keep the D.III block competitive was the 200 hp (200-217 hp) D.IIIav (or avü), introduced mid-October 1918. The av used slightly longer pistons made of aluminum (possibly a first for a production engine), increasing the compression yet again, while at the same time allowing them to move faster due to the reduced weight. The maximum allowable RPM increased from 1,400 in the earlier models to 1,600 in the av, accounting for most of the gains in power. It is unclear if any av's saw service use.  The increased use of Benzol in German aviation fuel may have helped this final upgrade of power, its higher octane rating being better suited for the higher compression ratio.

External differences between models

All of the D.III series were generally very similar to other models, with the exception of the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then.  The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier ""side-slot"" rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, rocker boxes, rocker arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier ""side-slot"" cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical ""slotless"" rocker-box overhead cam valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.

Confusingly, the ""ü"" was not an official part of the name. This leads to a number of problems in various references, which often confuse the IIIa with the IIIaü, listing the former as a 180 hp engine. There are two D.IV engines — from the IdFlieg aircraft powerplant class designations based on power output — one the straight-eight based on the 140mm bore D.III pistons; and the later, six-cylinder Mercedes D.IVa with 160mm bore cylinders, which was essentially unrelated.

The D.III line of engines would find themselves eclipsed in performance by the BMW IIIa of 185 and then 200 hp (British rated it at 230HP) in 1918, however, the small number of BMW's produced ensured that the Mercedes D.III series would be the primary German fighter engine up to the last month or two of the war and it would still be seen in very large numbers even at the end.  At the end of the war the D.IIIaü would still be the numerically predominant German fighter engine.  As a result, the Fokker D.VII's (those not equipped with BMW IIIa's) and the Pfalz D.XII's would be engine-limited in performance (as opposed to ""airframe-limited"") and yet would still be formidable adversaries to their Allied counterparts. The D.IIIaü was considered the optimum engine for the Roland D.VI, Pfalz D.IIIa, and Albatros D.Va fighters, whose airframes were of an earlier, ""all-wood"" generation in design.

The adoption of this provision, commonly called a ""non-discrimination policy,"" has sparked controversy among religious groups. Though federal law provides a non-discrimination exemption for fraternities and sororities, religious organizations are not granted the same exemption.

Background
In 2010, the Supreme Court passed a ruling declaring that educational institutions can refuse to recognize religious student organizations that do not admit all members into the organization. In November 2010, the Vanderbilt Hustler reported allegations that two members of Vanderbilt's Beta Upsilon Chi fraternity were asked to leave based on their homosexual orientation, an orientation prohibited by the Beta Upsilon Chi Code of Conduct. Following this controversy, the university opted to uphold the non-discrimination policy in favor of the homosexual students which sparked a divide among the university's Catholic and Christian student groups. Ultimately, of the 30 Christian groups previously on campus, 17 opted to remain on campus and abide by the policy, while 13 moved off campus.

82,354,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type2,"Receptor theory is the application of receptor models to explain drug behavior. Pharmacological receptor models preceded accurate knowledge of receptors by many years. John Newport Langley and Paul Ehrlich introduced the concept of a receptor that would mediate drug action at the beginning of the 20th century. Alfred Joseph Clark was the first to quantify drug-induced biological responses (specifically, f-mediated receptor activation). So far, nearly all of the quantitative theoretical modelling of receptor function has centred on ligand-gated ion channels and GPCRs.

History

The receptor concept
In 1901, Langley challenged the dominant hypothesis that drugs act at nerve endings by demonstrating that nicotine acted at sympathetic ganglia even after the degeneration of the severed preganglionic nerve endings. In 1905 he introduced the concept of a receptive substance on the surface of skeletal muscle that mediated the action of a drug. Langley postulated that these receptive substances were different in different species (citing the fact that nicotine-induced muscle paralysis in mammals was absent in crayfish). Around the same time, Ehrlich was trying to understand the basis of selectivity of agents. He theorized that selectivity was the basis of a preferential distribution of lead and dyes in different body tissues. However, he later modified the theory in order to explain immune reactions and the selectivity of the immune response. Thinking that selectivity was derived from interaction with the tissues themselves, Ehrlich envisaged molecules extending from cells that the body could use to distinguish and mount an immune response to foreign objects. However, it was only after Ahlquist demonstrated the differential effects of adrenaline on two distinct receptor populations, that the theory of receptor-mediated drug interactions gained acceptance.

Nature of receptor–drug interactions

Receptor occupancy model
The receptor occupancy model, which describes agonist and competitive antagonists, was built on the work of Langley, Hill, and Clark. The occupancy model was the first model put forward by Clark to explain the activity of drugs at receptors and quantified the relationship between drug concentration and observed effect. It is based on mass-action kinetics and attempts to link the action of a drug to the proportion of receptors occupied by that drug at equilibrium.  In particular, the magnitude of the response is directly proportional to the amount of drug bound, and the maximum response would be elicited once all receptors were occupied at equilibrium. He applied mathematical approaches used in enzyme kinetics systematically to the effects of chemicals on tissues.
He showed that for many drugs, the relationship between drug concentration and biological effect corresponded to a hyperbolic curve, similar to that representing the adsorption of a gas onto a metal surface and fitted the Hill–Langmuir equation. Clark, together with Gaddum, was the first to introduce the log concentration–effect curve and described the now-familiar 'parallel shift' of the log concentration–effect curve produced by a competitive antagonist. Attempts to separate the binding phenomenon and activation phenomenon were made by Ariëns in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding). Classic occupational models of receptor activation failed to provide evidence to directly support the idea that receptor occupancy follows a Langmuir curve as the model assumed leading to the development of alternative models to explain drug behaviour.

Competitive inhibition models

The development of the classic theory of drug antagonism by Gaddum, Schild and Arunlakshana built on the work of Langley, Hill and Clark. Gaddum described a model for the competitive binding of two ligands to the same receptor in short communication to the Physiological Society in 1937. The description referred only to binding, it was not immediately useful for the analysis of experimental measurements of the effects of antagonists on the response to agonists. It was Heinz Otto Schild who made measurement of the equilibrium constant for the binding of an antagonist possible.  He developed the Schild equation to determine a dose ratio, a measure of the potency of a drug. In Schild regression, the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve used to determine the affinity of an antagonist for its receptor.

Agonist models

The flaw in Clark's receptor-occupancy model was that it was insufficient to explain the concept of a partial agonist. This led to the development of agonist models of drug action by Ariens in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).

Two-state receptor theory

The two-state model is a simple linear model to describe the interaction between a ligand and its receptor, but also the active receptor (R*). The model uses an equilibrium dissociation constant to describe the interaction between ligand and receptor.  It proposes that ligand binding results in a change in receptor state from an inactive to an active state based on the receptor's conformation. A receptor in its active state will ultimately elicit its biological response. It was first described by Black and Leff in 1983 as an alternative model of receptor activation. Similar to the receptor occupancy model, the theory originated from earlier work by del Castillo & Katz on observations relating to ligand-gated ion channels. In this model, agonists and inverse agonists are thought to have selective binding affinity for the pre-existing resting and active states or can induce a conformational change to a different receptor state.  Whereas antagonists have no preference in their affinity for a receptor state. The fact that receptor conformation (state) would affect binding affinity of a ligand was used to explain a mechanism of partial agonism of receptors by del Castillo & Katz in 1957 was based on their work on the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate build on similar work by Wyman & Allen in 1951 on conformational-induced changes in hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity occurring as a result of oxygen binding. The del Castillo-Katz mechanism divorces the binding step (that can be made by agonists as well as antagonists) from the receptor activation step (that can be only exerted by agonists), describing them as two independent events.

Ternary complex model
The original Ternary complex model was used to describe ligand, receptor, and G-protein interactions.  It uses equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions between the receptor and each ligand (Ka for ligand A; Kb for ligand B), as well as a cooperativity factor (α) that denotes the mutual effect of the two ligands on each other's affinity for the receptor. An α > 1.0 refers to positive allosteric modulation, an α < 1.0 refers to negative allosteric modulation, and an α = 1.0 means that binding of either ligand to the receptor does not alter the affinity of the other ligand for the receptor (i.e., a neutral modulator). Further, the α parameter can be added as a subtle but highly useful extension to the ATCM in order to include effects of an allosteric modulator on the efficacy (as distinct from the affinity) of another ligand that binds the receptor, such as the orthosteric agonist. Some ligands can reduce the efficacy but increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist for the receptor.

Although it is a simple assumption that the proportional amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better measure for response than is the fractional or proportional change. This is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/ antagonist combinations on the desensitization of receptors. This is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated by overexpression, since this requires a change between R and R* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional rather than a net change, and for the molecular model that fits with the mathematical model.

Postulates of receptor theory
Receptors must possess structural and steric specificity.
Receptors are saturable and finite (limited number of binding sites)
Receptors must possess high affinity for its endogenous ligand at physiological concentrations
Once the endogenous ligand binds to the receptor, some early recognizable chemical event must occur

PharmacologyGünther Korten (26 July 1898 – 22 July 1944) was a German Colonel General and Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe in World War II. He died from injuries suffered in the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.

Biography

Early life
Korten was born in Cologne as a son of the architect Hugo Korten (1855–1931) and his wife Marie Korten (1866–1942). At the beginning of World War I he was a cadet in the Prussian army. He served through the war in an engineering battalion. He continued his military career after the war in the Engineers, until he was selected in 1928 to participate in the secret pilot training programme in the Soviet Union. On returning to Weimar Germany he joined the ""Bildstelle Berlin"".

World War II
Korten, by then a captain, joined the Luftwaffe in 1934 as Nazi Germany started on its rearmament programme. He received training as a general staff officer and served for several years in the Air Ministry. He was a Colonel and Chief of the General Staff of Luftflotte 4 (4th Air Fleet) stationed in Austria.

At the beginning of 1940, Korten was transferred to the general staff of the Luftflotte 3 (3rd Air Fleet), in which he served during the Battle of France  and in the Battle of Britain. On 19 July he was promoted to Major-General. In January 1941 he transferred back to the 4th Air Fleet, in order to participate in the Balkans Campaign and in the assault on the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). In August 1942 he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and took over the command over the I. Fliegerkorps, which fought at the southern sector of the Eastern Front and was temporarily transferred to the ""Luftwaffenkommando Don"" during the Battle of Stalingrad.

At the beginning of 1943 Korten was promoted to General and in the summer replaced Alfred Keller at Luftflotte 1 (1st Air Fleet). A few weeks later, on 25 August he accepted the position of Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe, after the former Chief of the General Staff Hans Jeschonnek committed suicide.

Death

Korten was seriously wounded in the Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg during the 20 July Plot in 1944, in which Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg attempted to assassinate Hitler with a bomb. Two days after the assassination attempt he succumbed to his injuries in the military hospital attached to the Führer's headquarters. Like the other military victims Rudolf Schmundt and Heinz Brandt he was posthumously promoted, in his case to Colonel-General.

Originally, Korten was buried in the Tannenberg Memorial. He was reburied in the Friedhof Bergstraße cemetery in Steglitz, Berlin. The grave still exists.

The name album is a reference to Jazz song Mood Indigo by Duke Ellington, and on March 24, 2017, the album ""Moog Indigo"" was reissued in the United States.

Composition 
""Soul City"" composed by Andy Badale and Pat Prilly, is a funky instrumental where Moog synthesizers take the place of horns in a guitar-heavy slice of R&B. ""E.V.A."" composed by Perrey himself together with Andy Badale and Marie Perreault is a funky synth excursion, and a tribute to the first man to walk on the moon. ""The Rose and The Cross"", composed only by Gilbert Sigrist is a much more serious melody than the rest of the album, while ""Cat In The Night"" has a subtle glow of darkness, rarely heard in Perrey's typically lighthearted recordings.

Perrey's version from Flight of the Bumblebee composed by Russian composer Rimsky Korsakov, uses real bee sounds from a Swiss hive that Perrey recorded with a Nagra tape recorder. As Perrey explains in his 1993 autobiography, after recording the sounds of bees he returned to New York City and spent a total of 46 hours cutting and gluing tiny pieces of magnetic tape for the version. In addition, Caroll awarded to him a 4-track Scully machine to complete said track.

Perrey's version of Moto Perpetuo written by the Italian composer Niccolo Paganini titled ""Gossipo Perpetuo"", use choppy vocal samples while congas and drums pound a samba beat, and ""18th Century Puppet"" shows clear nods to the baroque composition. After the synth version of Hello, Dolly!"" written by Jerry Herman, ""Passport to the Future"" is coming, a song that contains too much melodic influence from the hit of Joe Meek, ""Telstar"".

64,356,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type7,"A slow order  is a local speed restriction on a rail line which is set below the track's normal speed limit.

Slow orders are usually imposed by railway dispatchers for sections of track that are in some way deficient, or when there is a requirement to perform maintenance on a section of railway.

Slow orders are employed whenever continuous welded rail has some sort of derail or danger condition, such as an open critical joint, joints close to a bridge or movable bridge, or issues with settling ballast. Sometimes slow orders are imposed due to rail geometry defects or due to accumulations of snow.

When maintenance workers wish to work under dispatcher protection without a designated ""window"" of time where no trains are allowed to run, they typically post flags at either end of the section they will be working and a slow order is posted on the track.

Slow orders tend to disrupt timetables and can affect time-sensitive shipments, so railroads attempt to get them cleared as soon as safely possible.

9,357,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type3,"The 50 cc class was the ultra-lightweight class in Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and formed part of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) World Championships from 1962 until 1983; when the class was replaced by 80 cc.

History and development of the class
The relative low cost and increasing availability of 50 cc motorcycles in the post-war period, spawned a number of club road racing events for this size of machine in the early 1950s. With the earliest events being held in Italy and in the UK. The potential of this class for providing entertaining but affordable racing was soon recognised with several national championships and in 1961 the FIM introduced The Coupe d' Europe, a series of international events for 50 cc machines, each with a minimum duration and run to established Grand Prix rules and regulations. The series attracted a variety of entries, but the dominating force were the work's Kreidler team bikes. Based on a standard Kreidler Florett road bike, their single cylinder Kreidler Renn-Florett's featured lightweight frames, a special cylinder head and barrel, twin 16 mm Bing carburettors feeding the engine through rotary valves and improved suspension and brakes. By the end of the season, with the addition of rudimentary streamlining and the increase of carburettor size to 17 mm, the  four-speed two-stroke bikes could top over 85 mph.

The 1961 Coupe d’Europe

World Championship Status

See 1962 Season, 1963 Season, 1964 Season, 1965 Season, 1966 Season, 1967 Season

In 1962, the FIM followed up the success of the Coupe d’ Europe by giving the 50 cc class World Championship status. As well as the works entries of existing European manufacturers like Kreidler and Tomos, this development also attracted entries from Japanese manufacturers with both Honda and Suzuki entering full work's teams. The Spanish Derbi factory also entered a single work's bike for the Spanish Grand Prix.

The Kreidlers were now fitted with three speed overdrives controlled from the twistgrip, which coupled to the standard four-speed gearbox gave twelve gears to help keep the engines at maximum power. Engine development also increased power to  at 11,000 rpm. The Kreidlers development would be hampered however by the factory's insistence that the race bikes remained fundamentally based upon their standard road machines.  Suzuki and Honda knew no such limitations.

Honda's commitment to four-stroke engines dated back to 1951 with the launch of its Dream E-Type

prior to this all Honda's bikes were two-strokes. The change and long-term commitment to the more sophisticated four-stroke technology came either directly from founder Soichiro Honda or indirectly due to pressure from managing director Takeo Fujisawa, who was said to be appalled by the noise and smoke that two-stroke engines produced and the additional hassle that Honda customers faced by having to mix oil with their fuel. 
Honda began their first 50 cc GP season with the RC110, announced at the Japanese Motor Show in 1961. Powered by a single cylinder, four-valve engine, and with gear driven double overhead cams, giving about  at 14,000 rpm. It was introduced with a five-speed gearbox, but by the time of the opening GP in Spain, the bikes were upgraded to six gears. Even so, they were badly outperformed. Rider Tommy Robb suggested that more gears might be the answer and was amazed to find a week later at the French GP that the gearbox had been expanded to eight speeds. This still wasn't enough to compensate for the machine's relative lack of power and three weeks later at the Isle of Man TT, nine gears were fitted and the rev limit increased to 17,000 rpm with output now up to around 10 hp. In that season, the machine's designation was changed to RC111, but Honda's records are unclear as to what precise change in the development this signified or when it was used.

In contrast, the Suzuki team were committed to two-stroke technology and their single cylinder RM62 machine featured rotary valve induction and an 8-speed transmission and produced about  at 12,000 rpm. Ernst Degner who had defected from the East German MZ team to Suzuki the previous year, brought with him the secrets of MZ's two-stroke tuning success which undoubtedly helped him and the Suzuki team to secure the inaugural 50 cc World Championship.

The Japanese withdraw
After the withdrawal of Japanese firms from the 50 cc category at the end of 1968, cost-saving technological restrictions were introduced, the Spanish rider Angel Nieto came to the fore, and between 1969 and 1976, won the championship six times. His season long battle for the 1972 championship with Dutchman Jan de Vries, being perhaps the closest fought championship in any form of motor racing. By the end of the season both riders were tied with equal points, an equal number of wins and an equal number of second-place finishes and the championship winner was determined by adding together and comparing the times for the six races in which the pair had been placed. Nieto was calculated to have won the title by 21½ seconds from his rival.

Grand Prix motorcycle racingEagle & Hawk is a Canadian First Nations rock group based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, active since 1994. They are most noted for winning the Juno Award for Best Music of Aboriginal Canada Recording in 2002 for their album On and On. The band had numerous members throughout its history, with guitarist Vince Fontaine as the primary and constant member.

History
The band was formed in 1994 by Vince Fontaine and Troy Westwood. Their debut album The Dream was released in 1997. However, Westwood left the band that year as he was unable to balance the band's touring commitments against his work as a football player for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He was replaced by Jay Bodner, who remained the band's lead singer for the rest of its career, although Westwood remained an occasional guest collaborator.

Other musicians associated with the band have included keyboardists Gerry Atwell, Jaylene Johnson, Will Bonness, and Rena Semenko; bassists Randy Booth, Jeff Monkman, Clint Adams, Lawrence ""Spatch"" Mulhall, D.J. St. Germain, and Tik Mason; and drummers Mike Bruyere, Brent Fitz, Steve Broadhurst, Kevin Radomsky, Marty Chapman, and Rich Reid.

The band released 10 albums throughout its career.

In addition to their Juno Award win, the band won three awards, for best songwriter, best rock album for Mother Earth and best song for ""Sundancer"", at the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards in 2004. The band garnered two further Juno Award nominations for Aboriginal Recording of the Year, in 2004 for Mother Earth and in 2006 for Life Is. They also won awards from the Western Canadian Music Awards, the Native American Music Awards, the Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards, and the Indian Summer Music Awards.

In 2011, Fontaine collaborated with Don Amero, William Prince, Pamela Davis, and Neewa Mason in Indian City, a project whose 2012 album Supernation fused traditional aboriginal music with experimentally tinged folk rock. Amero won Male Entertainer of the Year, and Supernation won Best Pop Album, at that year's Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards.

Although the band have not recorded a new album since 2010's The Great Unknown, they continued to perform occasional live dates, including a 2012 benefit concert for musician Shingoose following his stroke.

Fontaine died of a heart attack on January 11, 2022, at the age of 60. The death was announced by his niece, provincial MLA Nahanni Fontaine.

81,359,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type3,"Samantha is a Venezuelan telenovela written by Vivel Nouel and produced by Venevisión in 1998. This telenovela lasted 120 episodes and was distributed internationally by Venevisión International.

Alicia Machado and Alejandro Martinez starred as the main protagonists with Nohely Arteaga and Milena Santander as antagonists.

Synopsis
Love literally falls from the sky for Samantha del Llano, a beautiful and free-spirited young peasant, who lives and works at landowner Valdemar Rincon’s lavish hacienda. One day, while wandering around the far reaches of the ranch in search of her horse, Samantha sees a small private plane crash nearby, and she immediately runs to the scene of the accident. Inside the plane, she finds Luis Alberto Aranguren, badly hurt but semi-conscious. Although she does not realize it yet, this handsome millionaire from the city will be her one true love.

Because the impact from the crash has caused Luis Alberto to lose his memory, he is unable to tell Samantha and the Rincon family his real identity. They believe him to be merely the pilot, an employee of the powerful Aranguren Corporation instead of its owner. Samantha does not really care who he is - she is a sweet, unpretentious country girl with few ambitions - and her main concern is nursing this stranger back to health. During the following weeks, a magical romance develops between Samantha and Luis Alberto, two persons who know practically nothing about each other, but are simply following their hearts.

However, once Luis Alberto is taken back to the capital, he recovers his memory and unconsciously blacks out everything that happened after the accident, including the loving Samantha. He returns home to discover that his wife, gravely ill for five years, has died. Everyone thinks she succumbed to her illness, but in reality Betzaida, who is secretly in love with Luis Alberto and is now determined to conquer him, murdered her. Another woman will try to do the same: Raiza, Valdemar Rincon’s daughter, a spoiled and selfish college student who set her sights on Luis Alberto after discovering his wealth and social position.

One day, while on a date with Raiza, Luis Alberto suddenly remembers Samantha, her soft touch, her radiant smile, her overpowering sweetness. Realizing what he left behind, he goes back to find her. They marry immediately, in a quiet village ceremony. Upon their return to the city, Samantha must face three formidable enemies: Betzaida, Raiza and Luis Alberto’s teenage daughter, Anabela, who feels betrayed by her father’s wedding, so soon after her mother’s death. Through lies and intrigue, these three women will succeed in tearing Samantha and Luis Alberto apart. They will both have to endure many hardships before they can be reunited to share the immense love that was born so innocently between them and that will live forever.

Life and career 
The son of Italian immigrants, Ceci was born in New York City, New York. He served in the United States Navy, during World War II. In 1947, Ceci graduated from the Theodore Roosevelt Evening High School in New York City. He graduated from Marquette University, in 1951, and received his law degree from the Marquette University Law School in 1954. Ceci worked as a private practice attorney in Milwaukee until 1958, when he was appointed Milwaukee's principal assistant city attorney; he occupied this position until 1963.

Public office 
In 1964, Ceci was elected as a Republican to the Wisconsin State Assembly. (He had made an unsuccessful bid for an Assembly seat in 1956, losing badly to John R. Meyer). He did not seek reelection in 1966 and was instead the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Wisconsin Attorney General. In 1968, Republican Governor Warren Knowles appointed Ceci to the Milwaukee County Court's traffic branch. Ceci was elected to the position in 1969 and was elected to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 1973. As a judge, Ceci clashed at times with Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann and with the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department.

In 1982, Ceci was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by Governor Lee Sherman Dreyfus; he was elected to a full term in 1984, and retired in September 1993.  At the time of his retirement, Ceci's judicial philosophy was classified as one of the most conservative among the court's justices.

It was first reconstructed using comparative methods in 1953 by Evangelina Arana Osnaya. Some linguists have proposed a link between the Totonacan and Mixe–Zoque language families; therefore making Proto-Totonacan a sister language of Proto-Mixe–Zoque and descendant of Proto-Totozoquean.

TotonacanFrederick George Burgess (16 July 1871 – 31 March 1951) was a British politician and trade unionist.

Burgess worked on the railways for many years and became active in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and its successor, the National Union of Railwaymen.  Increasingly holding prominent offices in the union, including secretary of the Maidstone branch for seventeen years, he also served on various government committees during World War I.  He also became active in the Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully for Maidstone at the 1918 general election.  Despite his lack of success, he left the railway industry the following year (refusing a post as night porter at NUR headquarters), and worked as a political agent and lecturer, also producing political cartoons and articles under the pseudonym of ""Battersea Bowser"".

At the 1929 general election, Burgess stood in York and won the seat.  He lost it at the 1931 general election, then moved to contest Accrington in 1935, but was again unsuccessful.  In 1937, he was elected to represent Camberwell North West on London County Council, serving until 1949.  He also served on Camberwell Metropolitan Borough Council. He served as Camberwell's mayor from 1947 until 1949, taking over from his wife Jessie Burgess who held the role from 1945 to 1947.

Switzerland youth international footballersPeire d'Alvernhe or d'Alvernha (Pèire in modern Occitan; b. c. 1130) was an Auvergnat troubadour (active 1149–1170) with twenty-one or twenty-four surviving works. He composed in an ""esoteric"" and ""formally complex"" style known as the trobar clus. He stands out as the earliest troubadour mentioned by name in Dante's Divine Comedy.

Life
According to his vida, Peire was a burgher's son from the Diocese of Clermont. As testified to by his vida, his popularity was great within his lifetime and afterwards. Said to be handsome, charming, wise, and learned, he was ""the first good inventor of poetry to go beyond the mountains"" (i.e. the Pyrenees) and travel in Spain. He passed his time in Spain at the court of Alfonso VII of Castile and that of his son Sancho III in 1157–1158. It is possible that he was present at a meeting between Sancho of Castile, Sancho VI of Navarre and Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona in 1158. The author of his vida, editorialising, considers his poems to have been the greatest until Giraut de Borneill and his melodies to have been the best ever. The anonymous biographer records that his information about Peire's later years comes from Dalfi d'Alvernha. It has been suggested that Dalfi was the author of the vida.

According to an accusation of fellow troubadour Bernart Marti, Peire entered upon a religious life early, but quit Holy Orders for a life of itinerant minstrelsy. He may be the same person as the Petrus d'Alvengue and Petrus de Alvernia who appear in surviving documents from Montpellier dated to the year 1148. Peire appears to have cultivated the favour of the ruling family of the Crown of Aragon, and his poems contain allusions to the counts of Barcelona and Provence. Perhaps he was following the fashion of the lords of Montpellier of his time, who, though vassals of the Count of Toulouse, were partial to the Aragonese. At the same time Peire did garner the support of Raymond V of Toulouse. In his wanderings he may have spent some time at Cortezon, at the court of the minor nobleman and troubadour Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Peire lived a long into old age, and performed penance before dying.

Poetry
Peire wrote mostly cansos, which, as his vida points out, were called vers in his day. He also invented the ""pious song"" and wrote six such poems dealing with serious themes of religion, piety, and spirituality. Even in his more profane works, however, one can detect the moralising influence of Marcabru, with whom in whose old age he was possibly acquainted. One of Marcabru's late songs is a satire of an early one by Peire d'Alvernhe. Marcabru's complexity was also imparted to Peire.

On the topic of courtly love, Peire, who had abandoned the religious life early, came to abandon the claims of fin'amor (""fine love"") later. When Peire espouses love of the Holy Ghost over cortez' amors de bon aire (""well-spirited courtly love"") he is the only troubadour to ever use the term ""courtly love"". Marcabrunian influence can be seen here too. In a later Crusade song, Peire defended Marcabru's abandonment of the carnal amar. He advocates gran sabers ni purs (""great and pure wisdom"") through bon'amor (""good love""). Along with Bernart Marti, Bernart de Venzac, and Gavaudan, Peire was part of a ""Marcabrunian school"". Nonetheless, as mentioned above, Bernart Marti attacked Peire for claiming superior spiritual status:
E quan canorgues si mes
Pey d'Alvernh'en canongia,
a Dieu per que.s prometia
entiers que peuys si fraysses?
Quar si feys, fols joglars es
per que l'entiers pretz cambia.
Peire's aesthetic philosophy esteemed the ""whole song"" (vers entiers), which is what he termed his completed pieces, denigrating all others' works as incomplete and imperfect. Nonetheless, from Marcabru Peire picked up a notion of the trobar braus as a legitimate format for ""rough"" themes.

One anonymous song of the Fifth Crusade, Lo Senhre que formet lo tro, written between Spring 1213 and July 1214 has been attributed to Peire d'Alvernhe, but the dating makes that impossible. In a tenso between a Bernart (probably Bernart de Ventadorn) and an unnamed Peire, perhaps Peire d'Alvernhe, the latter argues that ""it is not becoming for ladies to make love-pleas; it is fitting that men plead with them and beg their mercy.""

By far, however, Peire's most famous work is Chantarai d'aquest trobadors, a sirventes written at Puivert (Puoich-vert) in which he ridicules twelve contemporary troubadours (""a poetical gallery"") and praises himself. It has been conjectured that this piece was first performed in the presence of all twelve of the ridiculed poets in late Summer 1170 while an embassy bringing Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England, to her Spanish groom Alfonso VIII of Castile sojourned at Puivert. If the above date is not accepted, it can be probably dated later than 1165—since Giraut de Borneill was only active from c.1170—and certainly before 1173, when Raimbaut d'Aurenga died. The Monge de Montaudon later composed a parody of Peire's satire, Pos Peire d'Alvernhl a chantat.

Chantarai d'aquest trobadors is near universally regarded today as playful parody and not as a work of serious literary or artistic criticism. The obscurity of most of the ridiculed poets and the attack upon such personal characteristics as appearance and manners has been cited in support of the view that the parody was done in the presence of all twelve victims, further supporting the conclusion that the parody was good-natured. Besides the criticism of a personal nature, many of the criticism launched by Peire allude to the works of the others, notably those of Bernart de Ventadorn and Raimbaut d'Aurenga.

Music
Peire's vida acclaimed him an accomplished singer and the greatest composer of melodies for verses yet known. Peire's famous Chantarai d'aquest trobadors contains a final tornada indicating its musical nature, though its own melody has not survived:

Only two of Peire's melodies still exist: one of Dejosta.ls breus jorns e.ls lonc sers, a canso, and another of his tenso. Modern notations of both are provided in Aubrey, The Music of the Troubadours.

On the whole, Peire's music is more melismatic than that typical of the troubadours and it mimics the trobar clus style of his lyrics.

60,370,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type8,"Leonard Garfield Spencer (February 12, 1867 – December 15, 1914) was an early American recording artist. He began recording for the Columbia Phonograph Company, in 1889 or 1890. Between 1892 and 1897 he recorded extensively for the New Jersey Phonograph Company and its successor the United States Phonograph Company. He specialized in vaudeville sketches and comic songs, but also sang sentimental ballads popular at the time. He returned to Columbia in 1898 for an exclusive contract then began recording for Berliner Gramophone (disc) records in 1899 and continued with Victor and Columbia as discs became the dominant format in the early 1900s.

He began performing with banjoist Vess L. Ossman in 1901 and with Ada Jones in 1905. He is best remembered today for his vaudeville-style comic sketches, such as the ""Arkansaw Traveler"", combining clever turns of phrase, ironic elocutionary delivery, sound effects and music to create colorful dialogues featuring itinerant Southerners, auctioneers, circus barkers, and Irish, Jewish or Black Americans. Many of his roles were performed in either blackface or brownface.

As the popularity of Len's style of humor waned in the latter part of the decade, he opened a booking agency called ""Len Spencer's Lyceum"" in New York. He died of a heart attack while working at the Lyceum on December 15, 1914.

Songs
Some of his most popular recordings include:
 ""Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom Der E"" (1892)
 ""The Old Folks at Home"" (1892)
 ""Little Alabama Coon"" (1895)
 ""Dat New Bully"" (1895)
 ""A Hot Time in the Old Town"" (1897)
 ""Hello! Ma Baby"" (1899)
 ""Ma Tiger Lily"" (1900)
 ""Arkansaw Traveler"" (1902)

12,371,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type9,"Truro Township is one of the seventeen townships of Franklin County, Ohio, United States.  The 2010 census found 26,837 people in the township, 1,304 of whom lived in the unincorporated portions of the township.

Geography
Located in the eastern part of the county, it borders the following cities and townships:
Jefferson Township - north
Pataskala - northeast
Etna Township - east
Liberty Township - southeast
Madison Township - south
Columbus - west

Most of what was once Truro Township has been annexed by the cities of Reynoldsburg, in the east, and Columbus everywhere else, although the village of Brice is located in southern Truro Township, and several small unincorporated portions remain.

Name and history
It is the only Truro Township statewide.

Truro Township owes its name to Truro, Nova Scotia, the former hometown of the Taylor family of early settlers, who came to Ohio encouraged by the United States Congress to begin a new life in the Refugee Tract after having their estates seized by the British government for supporting the American Revolution.

Government
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.

Services

The township provides fire and EMS protection for the city of Reynoldsburg, the village of Brice as well as the unincorporated areas of the township. They also provide road maintenance in the unincorporated areas of the township and operate Silent Home Cemetery in Reynoldsburg.

Notable residents
Congressman Edward Taylor (1869-1938), grandson of early settler David Taylor.

Socio-economic indicators
Volga economic region accounted for almost 8 per cent of the national GRP in 2008. Popular approval of economic change is well above average in this region, both in terms of the rating of the national economy and the expectation of improvements in their own lives and in the household economy. People are also more likely than the average to have consumer goods. Life expectancy for men and women is also just above the national average.

However, reported GDP per capita is below the national average, and the regional wage levels are one-sixth below the national average. However, the likelihood of not being paid regularly is also below the national average. The discrepancies between these data and positive optimism of individuals can be influenced by the fact that in the Volga economic region those reporting having a second job are also above the national average.

They are known for a tightly arranged, guitar-driven style, melodic pop vocals and a high-energy stage presence at their live events.
They have been signed to the Japanese indie rock record label AVOCADO Records since the release of their self-titled EP in January 2008.

History

Early career
Mass of the Fermenting Dregs was formed in 2002 in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, with the original all-female lineup of Natsuko Miyamoto, Chiemi Ishimoto and Reiko Gotoh. The name of the band was conceived by simply lining up words the members liked. Following Reiko's departure from the band in October 2007, the band toured with the official lineup of Natsuko and Chiemi, with various musicians serving as a ""support drummer"". Their breakthrough came at the 2007 ""Road to Tarbox Audition"" competition held by EMI Japan, which put the band in contact with noted American record producer Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, OK Go) of Tarbox Road Studios. With Fridmann producing, they recorded two tracks, I F A Surfer and Bears (ベアーズ), which appeared on their 2008 self-titled E.P. In 2010, support drummer Yoshino Tsutomu became an official member of the band, prior to the release of their major label debut album.

Departure of Chiemi Ishimoto
In October 2010, it was announced that the band's guitarist of six years, Chiemi Ishimoto, would be leaving the group after completing the band's national tour on December 11, 2010. Her leaving was due to a medical panic disorder. Ishimoto's last performance was held at the Shibuya Club Quattro. Guitarist and lead vocalist Eriko Hashimoto of the band Chatmonchy attended the performance, sharing the enthralling experience of the final performance of ""End Roll"" on her official blog on her band's official website.

Departure of Yoshino Tsutomu
In December 2011, Yoshino Tsutomu announced that he would be leaving the group for undisclosed reasons. This left Miyamoto as the sole founding and active member of the band.

Dissolution
Though Natsuko Miyamoto, with the help of supporting members, continued to perform as Mass of the Fermenting Dregs through the spring of 2012, on September the 1st of the same year, she officially announced that Mass of the Fermenting Dregs would cease to exist as of that day. As a parting present, Miyamoto shared the last of the works recorded while Tsutomu was still a member. A song titled ""たんたんたん"" (tantantan) was made available for download through a direct link placed within the page containing the departing letter to the fans on the official M.o.F.D. website.

Reformation (2015–present)
In December the M.o.F.D website started to update, deleting the departing letter on the website. Natsuko Miyamoto sent hints on Twitter about M.o.F.D, and the band was later confirmed to play on the New Year's Q2 Concert, thus confirming the reunion of the band. In May, 2016, the band played in three Canadian cities on the ""Next Music From Tokyo"" concert tour.

Style and influences
The band's sound is often compared to that of other influential Japanese post-hardcore acts, notably NUMBER GIRL (ナンバー・ガール). They are often associated with the alternative/progressive rock act 9mm Parabellum Bullet(キューミリ・パラベラム・バレット), with whom they toured in early 2009.
The English version of the band's website also claims western alternative rock bands Sugar (American band), The Wedding Present, and The Smashing Pumpkins as influences on their songwriting.

32,374,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type1,"Slanci () is a suburban settlement of Belgrade, Serbia. It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula.

Location 
Slanci is located in the eastern section of the Palilula municipality,  from downtown Belgrade and few kilometers east of the neighborhood of Višnjica on the road of Slanački put (Slanci road) which connects Belgrade with Veliko Selo, the easternmost settlement in the municipality of Palilula.

The settlement is built on the southern slopes of the hill of Milićevo brdo (279 m), in the micro-valley of the short creek of Vrelski potok.  It is surrounded by the Pajstovica, Osovlje and Tapino hills, being tucked in on the southern side of the Danube ridge.

Population 

Population of Slanci is stagnating for decades: it had a population of 1,736 in 1991, 1,770 in 2002 and 1,783 in 1991. Serbs made 98% of the population according to the 2002 census.

Characteristics 
The name of the settlement, which means ""salty"" in Serbian, comes from the many springs in the hills above, many of which have mildly salty water. Using the natural inclination, villagers built a water supply system in the 19th century, when many towns in Serbia had no waterworks. Due to the lack of maintenance, the old aqueduct collapsed in the late 1990s.

Monastery 
A monastery of Slanci, dedicated to the Saint archdeacon Stefan, is located nearby. Original building was built in the late 13th century by King Dragutin after he received Belgrade and the northern Serbia from the Hungarian king. The monastery was originally dedicated to Mother of God. The area became part of the Serbian state again in 1403, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević who supported the monastery financially. During the reign of his successor, Đurađ Branković, the monastery was dedicated to the Saint Stephen, the saint protector of the Branković dynasty. The prosperity of the monastery was disrupted after the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459. Ottomans killed 30 students in the monastery but the relics were partially moved to the Vojlovica monastery in then Hungary, across the Danube. In the next five centuries, the monastery was demolished and rebuilt several times. In 1900 a chapel was built on the location of the former monastery. In 1960 patriarch German set the foundation stone for the new monastery which was consecrated in 1967, together with the adjoining konak. The monastery church was finished in 1970. In the vicinity of the monastery is the water spring named after Saint Sava. Since the mid-1970s, the monastery is a metochion of the Hilandar monastery on the Mount Athos. Hilandar bestowed to Slanci a copy of its famed icon of Bogorodica Trojeručica, made in Karyes. The monastery is protected both as the cultural monument and as an archaeological site.

Economy 
The settlement is officially classified as rural (village), as agriculture dominate its economy. As a typical representative of an urban agriculture, Slanci was previously known for the production of vegetables for the Balgrade markets. Although there are still some hoop houses, since the late 1990s the production is mostly fruit oriented: cherries, apricots, apples.

In recent years, some industrial facilities (warehouses and concrete plants) are developing between Belgrade (Lešće) and Slanci, along the Slanci road.

31,375,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type7,"West Linton () is a village and civil parish in southern Scotland, on the A702. It was formerly in the county of Peeblesshire, but since local government re-organisation in the mid-1990s it is now part of Scottish Borders. Many of its residents are commuters, owing to the village's proximity to Edinburgh, which is  to the north east. West Linton has a long history, and holds an annual traditional festival called The Whipman Play.

Prehistory and archaeology 
There is considerable evidence of the pre-historic occupation of the area. A right-of-way through the foothills of the Pentland Hills follows an important pre-historic routeway linking the Upper Clyde valley with the estuary of the River Forth. It is marked in this section by two large Bronze Age cairns, one of them being the best preserved example of its kind in the country. In 1994 a Bronze Age cemetery was excavated at the Westwater Reservoir. Significant artefacts were discovered, including several beakers and an important lead necklace.

Archaeological work between 1993 and 1998 at Siller Holes, West Linton, found evidence of lead mining from 12th to 14th centuries. Documented reference to the site only occurred in the late 16th century so it is unknown who was undertaking the mining.

History

The village of Linton is of ancient origin. Its name derives from a Celtic element (cognate with the modern Irish Gaelic linn, Scottish Gaelic linne, and modern Welsh ""Llyn"") meaning a lake or pool, a pool in a river, or a channel (as in Loch Linnhe, part of which is called An Linne Dhubh, the black pool, or  Dublin, an Anglicisation of dubh and linn, meaning black pool) and the Gaelic ""dun"" Welsh ""din""), for a fortress, fortified place, or military camp (related to the modern English town, by way of the Saxon ""tun"", a farm or collection of dwellings), and is evidently appropriate, as the village appears to have been surrounded by lakes, pools and marshes. At one time it was known as Lyntoun Roderyck, identified perhaps with Roderyck or Riderch, King of Strathclyde, whose territory included this area, or with a local chieftain of that name. The Scottish Gaelic version of the place name is a partial translation, Ruairidh being a Gaelic form of Roderick. The prefix ""West"" was acquired many centuries later to clarify the distinction from East Linton in East Lothian.
 
The first written record occurs in the twelfth century, when the Church of ""Linton-Ridric"" was gifted to the Church of St Mary of Kelso and ""the Monks serving God there"". The Church remained within the Diocese of Kelso until the Reformation (1560).

The old Edinburgh to Lanark road follows the line of the Pentland Hills. Between Dolphinton and Carlops it is now a right-of-way, approached from West Linton by the Loan or Medwyn Road: it crosses the road from West Linton to Baddinsgill near Medwyn House. This route continues north-west, following the important droving route along which sheep and cattle passed northwards through the Pentlands by way of the Cauldstane Slap for the great trysts at Crieff and Falkirk markets. Livestock from the north came south via the same route to West Linton and Peebles.

Linton was raised to a Burgh of Regality in 1631, with the right to hold fairs and markets. The importance of droving and the markets reached their zenith in the early years of the nineteenth century, when upwards of 30,000 sheep would be sold annually, including the famous Linton breed. The markets at Linton were considered the largest in Scotland and were widely referred to as an expression for any gathering of a large size: ""big as a Linton Market.""
West Linton had two therapeutic wells, the waters of which were sold on market days for either a penny or a half penny, depending on the well.

There were a tannery and brewery situated on the Upper Green and a gas works on the Lower Green, all now gone. The Manor House at the top of the main street dates from 1578, and is said to have been built on Saturday nights by masons who were engaged by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Regent of Scotland, to work on his castle of Drochil, seven miles distant down the Lyne valley.

Education
The appointment of a schoolmaster was first recorded in 1604 but there is no note of a schoolhouse until 1657. In 1791 the parish school was situated near the cross. A new parish school was opened in 1864 as a single-storey building and may be seen, somewhat altered, on the opposite side of the main street. At one time it was attended by over eighty pupils, all  accommodated in the single room.  On the Lower Green was a school for females and infants. There was also the Episcopalian School on Chapel Brae, connected with St Mungo's Church.

Children of the United Presbyterian Church congregation attended the Somervail School, built in 1852 from money left for the purpose by James Somervail of Moreham, whose wife was a member of the brewing family of Younger, of long standing in the village. The 'New' School on School Brae was built in 1907 but is now disused, replaced by the new primary school on Deanfoot Road that opened in October 2013.

Climate
As a part of the British Isles, West Linton experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. West Linton can be prone to notably low temperatures. Contributing factors include its location in a valley and the relatively elevated position of the village centre at approximately 230m above sea level. It has recorded a number of British low temperature date records, such as -21.8 °C on 12 January 1982, -11.7 °C on 1 April 1917, -10.0 °C on 30 October 1926 and -18.3 °C on 16 November 1919.

Village Greens
West Linton has two village greens, the Lower Green to the south and the Upper Green to the north, the land for which was granted to the inhabitants in perpetuity by the feudal Lord, the Earl of March. In 1729 there was objection on the part of a section of the congregation to the enforced settlement of the minister, and, on the day of ordination in 1731, ""riotous scenes"" were reported. Soldiers were sent to restore order, and as they forded the river at the Lower Green, they were pelted with stones by the indignant villagers, several of whom were taken to Edinburgh to answer for their disorderly conduct.

Kirks and folk

Adjacent to the Lower Green is the parish church of St. Andrew, flanked by the old graveyard in which stood the original church and manse. In 1780 plans were approved for a new church to be built on the old manse glebe, the minister to be compensated for the loss of his land by the addition of twelve shillings to his stipend. A new manse was built on the glebe land which had been acquired south of the river and in 1782 the new church itself was completed. In 1871 it was enlarged, the roof being raised to accommodate the gallery, larger windows were installed and the spire added. In the succeeding years the wood carvings executed by two local ladies, Miss Jane Fergusson of Spitalhaugh, and Mrs Wodropp of Garvald, were added to the interior walls and gallery. Of note in the graveyard are two bee-boles in the boundary wall in which ministers living in the old manse would place their skeps.

St Mungo's Scottish Episcopal Church sits at the top of the hill over looking this Green.

Rail and road
The Leadburn to Dolphinton branch line which was linked to the Peebles-Edinburgh railway was opened in 1864 and was designed by Thomas Bouch, who was also responsible for the ill-fated Tay Bridge. It was built to facilitate mining and quarrying activities in the area, and although these industries declined, the line led to the expansion of the village to accommodate Edinburgh folk who might rent a house in the summer, or decide to live here permanently, either travelling to work or as a place of retirement.

At the southern end of the main street near the parish church is the old toll house, built in the early nineteenth century at the entrance to the village on the Blyth Bridge to Carlops turnpike road. Tolls were levied on travellers, including the many drovers and their animals passing through the district. The ticket issued entitled the purchaser to pass free of charge through other districts provided they did so on the same day, but anyone attempting to bypass the toll could be fined twenty shillings if caught, and there were also severe penalties for those convicted of damaging or destroying a toll house.

Merchants and craftsmen
At the end of the eighteenth century there were between twenty and thirty looms in the village,  rising to about eighty in the early nineteenth century, some weaving household goods but most weaving cotton cloth for Edinburgh and Glasgow merchants.

It is estimated that in 1834 about fifty hands worked in the mines and quarries of the area. There were collieries near Carlops and Macbiehill, the latter operating until recent times; also quarries producing limestone for agricultural purposes. In 1834 there were five tailors in the village, four dressmakers, two butchers, five carriers, nine retailers of meal, groceries and spirits, two surgeons and four innkeepers.

Notable residents

Although West Linton has never played a significant part in the history of the country, several eminent men have taken up residence in the area. Early in the nineteenth century, John Hay Forbes (1776–1854) was raised to the bench with the title of Lord Medwyn, the name of the estate he had earlier purchased. This association with the Court of Session was maintained in the twentieth century by the Hon. Lord Henry Wallace Guthrie (1903-1970), one of the youngest judges to be appointed to the College of Justice. Fergusson Place perpetuates the memory of Sir William Fergusson of Spitalhaugh (1808–1877), surgeon to Queen Victoria.

The sculptor William Mossman was born here, as was the mathematician, John Brown Clark.

Robert Sanderson (born 1836), the ""Laureate of Lynedale"", wrote poems and sketches celebrating the Lyne valley, and his handsome tomb erected by his friends may be seen in the graveyard. George Meikle Kemp (1795–1844), the architect of the Scott Monument in Edinburgh, lived for a time near Dolphinton and came to school in the village.

The composer Ronald Stevenson (1928–2015) resided in the village.

Athlete Chris O'Hare is from the village, recently running the 1500m in the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio, Brazil.

George Johnston, owner of the first motorcar in Scotland and founder of the Arrol-Johnston automotive works was born in West Linton.

The Whipman Play
The Whipman Play is an annual summer festival held in the village, and is one of the Borders' oldest festivals the Whipman being the local man chosen as the focus of festivities. The festival commences on the Friday before the first Saturday in June, and runs until the following Saturday. The Whipman Play Society was formed in 1803 by local young men to alleviate hardship and illness for its members and in the community at large, 42 years before the Poor Law Amendment (Scotland) Act, 1845, and possibly before the first insurance company in Scotland.

Each year a local man is elected to the office of Whipman and he chooses the Whipman's Lass to assist him. These two represent the village at other Lothian and Borders festivals throughout their year in office. The celebrations begin with the Installation of the Whipman & Lass, followed by a celebratory ceilidh. The following day, the Ride Out (of around 80 to 100 horses) introduces the Whipman to the area, and a full week of events culminates in the annual sports day, held on the village green.

In 2020, the summer festival did not take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to mark the events, silhouette statues were erected around the village during the week, raising money for the Tiny Changes mental health charity in memory of musician Scott Hutchison, whose family live in the area.

History 
Empire Interactive was established by Ian Higgins (chief executive officer) and Simon Jeffrey (managing director) in 1987. In November 2000, the company acquired development studio Razorworks.

As well as full priced titles, Empire also had a budget range of titles, Xplosiv, for PC and PS2. Initially launched for PC in January 2000, Xplosiv published titles in Europe from third parties such as Sega and Microsoft. Later, in 2003 Empire launched titles for PS2.

In March 2002 Empire acquired music creation software eJay.

Silverstar Holdings, a U.S. public company listed on NASDAQ, offered to acquired Empire Interactive in late October 2006. The deal was accepted by 90% of Empire Interactive's shareholders by late November, and so Silverstar Holdings acquired 85% of Empire Interactive's shares. The deal was valued at approximately . Admissions of further Empire Interactive shares on the Alternative Investments Market of the London Stock Exchange, were expected to be cancelled, effective on 20 December. Higgins stepped down from his position in May 2008. In July, Empire Interactive reduced its staff count by 30%, with the intent to sell Razorworks. Razorworks was sold to and absorbed by Rebellion Developments a few days later. After Silverstar Holdings was delisted from NASDAQ in March 2009, Empire Interactive was placed into administration on 1 May 2009, with KPMG Restructuring appointed as administrator. Subsequently, 49 out of 55 employees were laid off, with the remaining six staying to aiding KPMG Restructuring in the winding-down of the company. Empire Interactive's intellectual property was sold to U.S.-based company New World IP. Shortly thereafter, U.S. publisher Zoo Publishing acquired an exclusive licence for the publishing and distribution of Empire Interactive from New World IP.

SeashellThe 1980 Illinois Fighting Illini football team was an American football team that represented the University of Illinois during the 1980 Big Ten Conference football season.  The Illini finished in three-way tie for sixth place in the Big Ten Conference (Big Ten), compiled a 3–7–1 record (3–5 against Big Ten opponents), and outscored their opponents by a combined total of 326 to 241. The team played its home games at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois.

In December 1979, Illinois hired Mike White to replace Gary Moeller. Moeller's teams had gone 3-16-3 in the prior two seasons. White had been an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers in 1978 and 1979 and was the head coach for the California Golden Bears from 1972 to 1977. The 1980 season was Illinois' first under coach White.

The team's offensive leaders were quarterback Dave Wilson with 3,154 passing yards, running back Mike Holmes with 305 rushing yards, wide receiver Mike Martin with 555 receiving yards, and placekicker Mike Bass with 45 points. Wilson was selected as the team's most valuable player.

Several Illinois players also ranked among the Big Ten leaders in various statistical categories, including the following:
 Dave Wilson led the Big Ten with 245 pass completions, 463 pass attempts, and 503 total plays and ranked second with 3,154 passing yards, 19 passing touchdowns, and 2,960 total yards.
 Mike Martin ranked second in the Big Ten with 17.9 yard per reception and 8.2 yards per punt return, fourth with 123 punt return yards, and 10th with 555 receiving yards.

Pre-season
In December 1979, Illinois hired Mike White to replace Gary Moeller. Moeller's teams had gone 3-16-3 in the prior two seasons. White had been an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers in 1978 and 1979 and was the head coach for the California Golden Bears from 1972 to 1977.

Game summaries

Northwestern
On September 6, in the first game of the Big Ten season, Illinois defeated Northwestern, 35–9, at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. It was Illinois' first game under new head coach Mike White and its first victory at Memorial Stadium since October 1977.

Michigan State
On September 13, Illinois defeated Michigan State, 20–17, to spoil Muddy Waters debut as the Spartans' head coach. Mike Bass kicked the game-winning field goal as time ran out.

at Missouri
On September 20, in the Illinois–Missouri football rivalry game, Illinois lost to Missouri (AP No. 15), 52–7, in Columbia, Missouri. The lopsided game was Illinois' first loss under new head coach Mike White. Missouri totaled 486 yards of total offense, including 105 rushing yards by running back James Wilder Sr.

Air Force
On September 27, Illinois and Air Force played to a 20–20 tie before a crowd of 45,638 at Memorial Stadium in Champaign. An inadvertent whistle saved the game for Illinois in the fourth quarter.  With 6:12 left in the game and Illinois trailing, 20-17, Illinois quarterback fumbled into the arms of a defender, but the play was negated when officials ruled that the play should be replayed as the result of an ""inadvertent"" whistle blown during the play. Illinois then continued its drive which culminated in a Mike Bass field goal with 3:13 left in the game.

Mississippi State
On October 4, Illinois lost to Mississippi State, 28–21, before a crowd of 60,889 in Champaign. Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson set an Illinois single-game record with 23 completions and passed for 283 yards. Mississippi State scored its four touchdowns off two Illinois fumbles, an interception, and a blocked punt.

at Iowa
On October 11, Illinois defeated Iowa, 20–14, before a crowd of 59,780 at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Illinois led, 20-0, early in the third quarter  when Illinois cornerback Rick George returned a fumble 13 yards for a touchdown on the third play of the second half. Iowa then mounted a comeback that fell short. Keith Chappelle led the comeback effort, catching two touchdown passes in the second half. Chappelle broke an Iowa single-game record with 191 receiving yards and tied another with 11 receptions.

Purdue
On October 18, Purdue defeated Illinois, 45–20, before a crowd of 62,121 in Champaign. In a remarkable passing exhibition, the Big Ten single-game record for passing yardage was broken twice in the same game. Mark Hermann broke the record first with 371 yards, surpassing the mark set two years earlier by Eddie Smith. Hermann went to the bench halfway through the fourth quarter, only to watch his record broken by Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson who tallied 425 passing yards as the Illini passed with abandon through the final minutes.  Wilson also broke Big Ten single-game records with 58 passes and 35 completions.

at Michigan
On October 25, Michigan defeated Illinois, 45–14, before a homecoming crowd of 105,109 in Ann Arbor. The game had special significance, because Michigan assistant coaches Gary Moeller and Lloyd Carr had been fired by Illinois after the 1979 season.  Rumors spread before the game that coach Schembechler wanted to ""make Illinois pay"" for the firings.  Michigan back Stan Edwards and Lawrence Ricks rushed for 152 and 97 yards, respectively.  Anthony Carter caught five passes for 121 yards and a touchdown in the first half.  After the game, the Michigan players presented game balls to assistant coaches Moeller and Carr.

Minnesota
On November 1, Minnesota defeated Illinois, 21–18, before a homecoming crowd of 51,202 in Champaign. Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson completed 22 of 59 passes for 310 yards and two touchdowns.

at Ohio State
On November 8, Ohio State (AP No. 7) narrowly defeated Illinois, 49–42, in Columbus. Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson set an NCAA single-season record with 621 passing yards. Art Schlichter threw four touchdown passes and broke the Ohio State career total yards record previously held by Archie Griffin.

at Indiana
On November 15, Indiana defeated Illinois, 26–24, in Bloomington. Indiana tailback Lonnie Johnson rushed for a school record 237 yards on 37 carries. Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson kept the game close as he passed for 403 yards and three touchdowns.

52,379,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type0,"Kris Martin (born 1972 in Kortrijk) is a Belgian conceptual visual artist. His work consists of monumental and small-scale sculptures, drawings and interventions.

Recurring themes in his work are the notion of time, history and the transience of human existence. His artwork also explores the relationship between the creators and the consumers of art, and combines elements of contemplation with humour and playfulness.

Among his best known works are 'Mandi XVIII', a plaster cast of the Laocoon group with the snakes omitted, and '100 years' a sculpture that will explode in 100 years from its conception. Martin has worked with curators Jan Hoet and Jens Hoffmann.

Martin held his first solo show in 2000.  Since then he has mounted many solo exhibitions, and his work has been included in dozens of group exhibitions.

In 2020, a retrospective of Martin's work was held at S.M.A.K Ghent titled EXIT. The exhibition gathered many well known works amongst which the iconic Altar (2004), with recent additions such as Water (2020), a spread of vessels holding the life sustaining liquid.

Belgian artistsCall of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the first installment in the Call of Duty franchise, released on October 29, 2003, for Microsoft Windows. The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series; however, Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the American, British, and Soviet theaters of World War II.

The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the ""lone wolf"" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The game received critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards from reviewers.

In September 2004, an expansion pack called Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision and developed by Gray Matter Interactive and Pi Studios, was released. At the same time the N-Gage Version got an Arena Pack with 3 new Levels. An enhanced port of Call of Duty for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, titled Call of Duty Classic, was released worldwide in November 2009 with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, being available via redemption codes included with the ""Hardened"" and ""Prestige"" editions of the game.

Gameplay

As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives that are marked on the heads-up display's compass; the player must complete all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later Call of Duty games.

The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot, and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's actual sights for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are controllable by the player.

The game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of health reflected by a health bar. Medkits scattered throughout the levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the player is injured.

Call of Duty also featured ""shellshock"" (not to be confused with the psychological condition of the same name): when there is an explosion near the player, he momentarily experiences simulated tinnitus, appropriate sound ""muffling"" effects, blurred vision, and also results in the player slowing down, unable to sprint.

As the focus of the game is on simulation of the actual battlefield, the gameplay differed from many single-player shooters of the time. The player moves in conjunction with allied soldiers rather than alone; allied soldiers will assist the player in defeating enemy soldiers and advancing; however, the player is given charge of completing certain objectives. The game places heavy emphasis on usage of cover, suppressive fire, and grenades. AI-controlled soldiers will take cover behind walls, barricades, and other obstacles when available.

Campaign

American campaign
The American campaign begins with Private Martin, a newly enlisted member of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, completing basic training at Camp Toccoa in Georgia, United States, on August 10, 1942. Afterwards, the action shifts to June 6, 1944, with Martin forced to undertake a solo mission to establish a landing zone for soldiers participating in Operation Overlord. Under heavy fire, the paratroopers are scattered, leaving Martin in a mixed unit formed from various companies led by his CO Cpt. Foley. The mission closes with Martin and his allies seizing a nearby town from German forces. In the second mission, Martin and his unit are sent to drive out the remaining Germans from Sainte-Mère-Église and disable several Flakpanzers (anti-aircraft tanks) as the events of June 6 begin (D-Day). A paratrooper is seen hanging from the town church. The third mission occurs later that morning, with U.S. forces fending off a German counterattack. The fourth mission has Martin, Pvt. Elder (voiced by Giovanni Ribisi) of the 82nd Airborne and Sgt. Moody driving from Sainte-Mère-Église to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont along highway N13 to deliver an important message, while fending off German assaults. The fifth mission, the Brécourt Manor Assault, occurs on the evening of June 6, with Martin's unit destroying German artillery positions attacking the landing force at Utah Beach. After the mission, Martin learns that his unit has been assigned to several secret missions. The first occurs in the sixth mission, with Martin participating in an attack on a secret German prison in the basement of a Bavarian manor to rescue two British officers, Captain Price and Major Ingram. He then learns from Price that Ingram had already been moved to a more secure POW camp for interrogation. Thus, the seventh mission has Martin, accompanied by Price, infiltrating the camp and rescuing Ingram in under ten minutes before the arrival of German reinforcements.

In the final mission, Martin's unit takes part in the Battle of the Bulge, successfully securing top-secret documents from a bunker and stopping an attempt by the Germans to reinforce their troops with tanks.

British campaign
The first mission of the British campaign has Sergeant Jack Evans and a unit from 2nd Ox and Bucks of the 6th Airborne Division take part in Operation Tonga. Just after midnight on June 6, 1944, the unit is dropped in Horsa gliders alongside the Caen Canal near Pegasus Bridge, Bénouville. Led by Captain Price, Evans and his troops clear the bridge of German soldiers. In the second mission, just past noon on the same day, the unit manages to hold out against an attempt by a German battalion, supported by tanks, to retake the bridge. Eventually, reinforcements from the 7th Parachute Battalion arrive and the Germans retreat.

By the time of the third mission, on September 2, Evans has been transferred to the Special Air Service or SAS. He takes part in a mission to sabotage the Eder Dam, destroying the anti-aircraft guns protecting it. During Operation Chastise the previous May, the No. 617 Squadron RAF destroyed the dam using bouncing bombs, but the Germans had been able to restore it. Following extraction by Price and Sgt. Waters (voiced by Jason Statham), the fourth mission begins with Evans fighting off pursuing German troops until Waters cuts them off by blowing up a bridge. The fifth mission sees the team arriving at a German airport to complete their escape. Evans uses an anti-air gun to cover Price and Waters from German Stuka dive-bombers as they procure a Fw.200, using it to fly to safety. In the sixth mission, Evans and Price pose as German naval officers to infiltrate the battleship Tirpitz, disable its defenses, and steal information the RAF needs to attack the ship. Price sacrifices himself to buy time for Evans, who escapes with Waters by boat.

The final mission of the British campaign shows Evans, Waters and their squad near Burgsteinfurt, Germany, with orders to assist the impending Allied assault on the city. Discovering plans to launch V-2 rockets at the Allied forces, the unit destroys them before joining the rest of the army.

Soviet campaign
The first mission in the Soviet campaign occurs during the Battle of Stalingrad on September 18, 1942. Corporal Alexei Ivanovich Voronin, a young volunteer, and his fellow recruits are sent across the Volga River, many of whom are subsequently killed when the Luftwaffe launch an attack. Once across, Voronin is given a small number of bullets, which he gives to a fellow soldier so he can cover an officer calling in an artillery strike that forces the Germans back. The second mission begins in Red Square with Soviet officers killing soldiers who retreat (see Joseph Stalin's Order No. 227—""Not one step back!"")  Some say the opening of the campaign is based on Enemy at the Gates. Voronin gets his hands on a rifle and kills several German officers, disrupting the German offense long enough for Soviet artillery to destroy their tanks. In the next mission, Voronin links up with his surviving allies in a train station and must guide them to Major Zubov of the 13th Guards Rifle Division. For his actions, Voronin is promoted to Junior Sergeant. The fourth mission, on November 9, has Voronin moving through the sewers to rendezvous with a unit tasked with retaking an apartment building in German hands. The following fifth mission has Voronin join the unit, led by Sergeant Pavlov, as they prepare to attack the building (see Pavlov's House). Voronin acts as a counter-sniper while another soldier draws the fire of the snipers in the building; the unit assaults the building, clears it of Germans and defends it from a German counterattack until reinforcements arrive.

The sixth mission occurs much later, on January 17, 1945, with Voronin now a full Sergeant, serving with the 150th Rifle Division of the 3rd Shock Army. The unit secures a makeshift German tank repair facility in Warsaw in the midst of the Vistula–Oder Offensive. The seventh mission takes place shortly after, with the unit moving to regroup with the 4th Guards Tank Army. Due to shortages in experienced soldiers, the eighth mission, on January 26, requires Voronin to command a T-34-85 tank for the 2nd Guards Tank Army. In a full scale offense, the Soviets capture a town near the Oder River. The ninth mission is also fought in the tank, with Voronin eliminating all surviving German units in the town.

In the final mission, on April 30, 1945, Sergeant Voronin is returned to his old unit, the 150th Rifle Division. He and a small group of soldiers storm the Reichstag building and raise the Victory Banner atop the roof, ending the European war.

Development

Call of Duty was developed by Infinity Ward, a new studio formed in 2002 originally consisting of 21 employees, many of whom were project lead developers of the successful Medal of Honor: Allied Assault released the same year. Led by Chief Creative Officer Vince Zampella, development began in April 2002, and the team grew to 27 members by May 2003. Using an enhanced version of the id Tech 3 game engine developed for Quake III Arena and an in-house skeletal animation system called ""Ares"", Infinity Ward set out to develop a new World War II-era video game that, unlike many of its predecessors, placed more emphasis on squad-based play with intelligent assistance from teammates during large-scale battles. The team also extensively researched weapons, artillery, and vehicles from World War II to enhance the authenticity of animation and sounds used throughout the game. The game's budget was $4.5 million.

Another area the development team focused on was their artificial intelligence (AI) pathfinding component dubbed ""Conduit"". The ability to suppress the enemy with cover fire and clear obstacles, such as fences and windows, was tightly integrated into the squad-based aspect of the single-player campaigns. The AI in the game was designed to flank the opponent, bank grenades, and move from one cover point to another. Lead animation director Michael Boon explained that actions which would have normally been scripted in past games were moved to a dynamic AI environment, in order to help create a different experience each time levels are replayed. While the campaigns were the primary focus, development of the multiplayer modes were tailored to please modders. Zied Rieke, a lead designer, clarified that gameplay and modes were written in script making it ""extremely easy for players to make their own modifications to Call of Duty multiplayer"".

Reception

Critical reception
Call of Duty received ""critical acclaim"", according to review aggregator Metacritic. It won several ""Game of the Year"" awards for 2003 from several reviewers. 

During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), it was honored ""Game of the Year"" of 2003 by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences; it also received awards for ""Computer Game of the Year"" and ""Computer First Person Action Game of the Year"", along with being nominated for ""Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming"", ""Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition"", and ""Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design"". 

GameSpot named it the best computer game of October 2003.

Computer Games Magazine named Call of Duty the sixth-best computer game of 2003, and the editors wrote, ""This game ups the ante in the WWII shooter arena, and makes everything that has come before it seem as outdated as France's army."" The editors of Computer Gaming World presented Call of Duty with their 2003 ""Shooter of the Year"" award. They remarked, ""Call of Duty won this category without a shot fired—there simply was no debate."" It was also nominated for ""Best Game"" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While it did not receive that award, it did win Infinity Ward the ""Rookie Studio of the Year"". Chuck Russom was also presented with the ""Excellence in Audio"" award for his work on the game.

IGN rated the game 9.3/10, with reviewer Dan Adams saying ""You have to love a game that glues you to your seat and keeps you interested... A thrilling piece of software that action fans should grab a hold of and love fiercely."" His only negative critique was on the short length of the game, which many reviewers pointed out.

The N-Gage version got ""Mixed or average reviews"" on the site Metacritic.

Sales
The NPD Group named Call of Duty the eighth-best-selling computer game of 2003. It maintained this position on NPD's computer game sales rankings for the following year. In the United States alone, Call of Duty sold 790,000 copies and earned $29.6 million by August 2006. At the time, this led Edge to declare it the country's 13th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.

In the United Kingdom, Call of Duty sold 95,000 copies by the end of 2003, which made it 88th-biggest seller across all platforms that year. Discussing this performance, Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that ""Activision will be pleased that it managed to interrupt the Sims party"" with the game's release. Call of Duty ultimately received a ""Silver"" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

Call of Duty ultimately sold 4.5 million copies worldwide by 2013.

Franchise

Call of Duty spawned numerous spin-offs and sequels, part of the Call of Duty series. Its expansion pack - Call of Duty: United Offensive was developed by Gray Matter Interactive and released September 14, 2004. Call of Duty 2 was also developed by Infinity Ward and was released in October 2005. Some Call of Duty spinoffs were developed for consoles, such as Call of Duty: Finest Hour by Spark Unlimited and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One by Gray Matter Interactive (now Treyarch). The franchise eventually had over fifteen more sequels and spin offs.

Ports
Call of Duty Classic is a downloadable version of Call of Duty for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, featuring HD resolutions. Tokens to download the game ahead of its release were sold along with special ""Hardened"" and ""Prestige"" editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and the game was publicly released on December 2, 2009.

IGN rated this version 7.5, citing it as not well adapted to the consoles, as well as criticizing the multiplayer for only supporting up to eight players.

Biography
Annie May Hurd was born in 1893 in La Conner, Washington. She received an A.B. degree from the University of Washington in 1915 and an M.S. from that institution in 1917.  She received her Ph.D. in plant physiology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1918.  The same year that she received her doctoral degree, Hurd joined the staff of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as a researcher for the Bureau of Plant Industry.  She married physicist Sebastian Karrer in 1923.  She continued her work for USDA, specializing in the improvement of cereal crops and the control of their diseases.  Now as Annie Karrer, she rose to the position of associate plant physiologist in 1924; she was named plant physiologist in 1944, a position she held until 1949. Karrer published 16 papers in the USDA series of reports.  Her articles appeared in journals including the American Journal of Botany, Plant Physiology, The Journal of General Physiology, and Soil Science.  Three papers on the effects of selenium appeared in Science in the 1930s.

Karrer made a gift to the University of Washington that established the Sebastian Karrer Prize, in honor of her husband.  First given in 1947, it is awarded to a senior or graduate student in the department of physics on the basis of need, scholarship, and good character.

23,382,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type4,"Donkey sentences are sentences that contain a pronoun with clear meaning (it is bound semantically) but whose syntactical role in the sentence poses challenges to grammarians. Such sentences defy straightforward attempts to generate their formal language equivalents. The difficulty is with understanding how English speakers parse such sentences.

Barker and Shan define a donkey pronoun as ""a pronoun that lies outside the restrictor of a quantifier or the if-clause of a conditional, yet covaries with some quantificational element inside it, usually an indefinite."" The pronoun in question is sometimes termed a donkey pronoun or donkey anaphora.

The following sentences are examples of donkey sentences.
"""" (""Every man who owns a donkey sees it"") — Walter Burley (1328), 
""Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.""
""Every police officer who arrested a murderer insulted him.""

History
Walter Burley, a medieval scholastic philosopher, introduced donkey sentences in the context of the theory of suppositio, the medieval equivalent of reference theory.

Peter Geach reintroduced donkey sentences as a counterexample to Richard Montague's proposal for a generalized formal representation of quantification in natural language. His example was reused by David Lewis (1975), Gareth Evans (1977) and many others, and is still quoted in recent publications.

Analysis of donkey sentences
The goal of Montague grammar was to show how sentences of a natural language (like English) could be translated into a formal logical language, and so would then be amenable to mathematical analysis. Following  Russell, it is typical to translate indefinite noun phrases using an existential quantifier,
as in the following simple example from Burchardt et al:

 ""A woman smokes."" is translated as 

The prototypical donkey sentence, ""Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it."", requires careful consideration for adequate description (though reading ""each"" in place of ""every"" does simplify the formal analysis). The donkey pronoun in this case is the word it. Correctly translating this sentence will require using a universal quantifier for the indefinite noun phrase ""a donkey"", rather than the expected existential quantifier.

The naive first attempt at translation given below is not a well-formed sentence, since the variable  is left  free in the predicate .

 

It may be attempted to extend the scope of the existential quantifier to bind the free instance of , but it still does not give a correct translation.

 

This translation is incorrect since it is always true. Given any object to be substituted for , substituting any non-donkey object for  makes the material conditional true (since its antecedent is false), and so existential clause is true for every choice of .

A correct translation into first-order logic for the donkey sentence seems to be

 ,

indicating that indefinites must sometimes be interpreted as existential quantifiers, and other times as universal quantifiers.

There is nothing wrong with donkey sentences: they are grammatically correct, they are well-formed and meaningful, and their syntax is regular. However, it is difficult to explain how donkey sentences produce their semantic results, and how those results generalize consistently with all other language use. If such an analysis were successful, it might allow a computer program to accurately translate natural language forms into logical form. It is unknown how natural language users are – apparently effortlessly – agreeing on the meaning of sentences such as the examples.

There may be several equivalent ways of describing this process. In fact, Hans Kamp (1981) and Irene Heim (1982) independently proposed very similar accounts in different terminology, which they called discourse representation theory (DRT) and file change semantics (FCS), respectively.

Theories of donkey anaphora
It is usual to distinguish two main kinds of theories about the semantics of donkey pronouns. The most classical proposals fall within the so-called description-theoretic approach, a label that is meant to encompass all the theories that treat the semantics of these pronouns as akin to, or derivative from, the semantics of definite descriptions. The second main family of proposals goes by the name dynamic theories, and they model donkey anaphora – and anaphora in general – on the assumption that the meaning of a sentence lies in its potential to change the context (understood as the information shared by the participants in a conversation).

Description-theoretic approaches

Description-theoretic approaches are theories of donkey pronouns in which definite descriptions play an important role. They were pioneered by Gareth Evans's E-type approach, which holds that donkey pronouns can be understood as referring terms whose reference is fixed by description.

For example, in ""Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it."", the donkey pronoun ""it"" can be expanded as a definite description to yield ""Every farmer who owns a donkey beats the donkey he/she owns."" This expanded sentence can be interpreted along the lines of Russell's theory of descriptions.

Later authors have attributed an even larger role to definite descriptions, to the point of arguing that donkey pronouns have the semantics, and even the syntax, of definite descriptions. Approaches of the latter kind are usually called D-type.

Discourse representation theory
Donkey sentences became a major force in advancing semantic research in the 1980s, with the introduction of discourse representation theory (DRT). During that time, an effort was made to settle the inconsistencies which arose from the attempts to translate donkey sentences into first-order logic.

The solution that DRT provides for the donkey sentence problem can be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of non-anaphoric noun phrases is the introduction of a new discourse referent, which is in turn available for the binding of anaphoric expressions. No quantifiers are introduced into the representation, thus overcoming the scope problem that the logical translations had.

Dynamic Predicate Logic

Dynamic Predicate Logic models pronouns as first-order logic variables, but allows quantifiers in a formula to bind variables in other formulae.

It is based on William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice, and features Sama as the title character. The film was released on 23 November 1940 and failed commercially. No print of it is known to survive, making it a lost film.

Production 
Kinema Ramu, a lawyer based in Kumbakonam and scholar on William Shakespeare, wrote the screenplay for Shylock, a Tamil adaptation of Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. He and his friend Serukalathur Sama directed the film under the name Sama-Ramu. The film was produced by Bharat Pictures. Sama also played the title character. The lyricists were Yaanai Vaidyanatha Iyer, P. S. Sivaramalingam (who acted onscreen as the Duke) and Papanasam Rajagopala Iyer, brother of Papanasam Sivan. S. G. Kasi Iyer, the brother of Tamil theatre actor S. G. Kittappa, was the music director, besides playing Antonio onscreen. Cinematography was handled by K. Prabhakar, and editing by T. R. S. Raghavan. Shooting took place at Bharat Movietone in Kilpauk. The makers went to great lengths to recreate an authentic Venetian look for the narrative through the costumes and setting.

Release and reception 
Shylock was released on 23 November 1940. Kay Yess Enn of The Indian Express wrote on the same day, ""To attempt to bring Shakespeare on the screen and to succeed at that keeping faithfully to the original, is a creditable achievement standing in the name of Serukulathur Sama and Rama"". The film did not succeed commercially; according to historian Randor Guy, this was because audiences could not relate to the characters, costumes and sets. No print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film.

(Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code of 1860 lays down that anyone who cheats and dishonestly induces a person to hand over any valuable property shall be punished with imprisonment and a fine.) Its first appearance in book form was in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888. It was the third of the stories that appear in that collection to be written 

""In the House of Suddhoo"", therefore, is a story about deception. There are several layers of uncertainty in it. Suddhoo is a ""very, very old"" man who lets rooms in his house. The inhabitants are: on the ground floor, Bhagwan Dass, the grocer, and a man who claims to be a seal-cutter, together with their households; on the upper floor, Janoo (and formerly Azizun, who has now married and left), ""Ladies of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honourable profession"" (that is, prostitutes). Here is one layer of questionable honesty - although Kipling is at pains to show Janoo as honest and intelligent. The narrator is in favour with Suddhoo, because he, a Sahib or Briton has got a job for one of Suddhoo's cousins. ""Suddhoo says that God will make me a Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. [Another layer of dishonesty - or humour?] I daresay his prophecy will come true. [Again]""

Suddhoo is very fond of his son, who lives at Peshawar, some 400 miles away. The young man contracts pleurisy. The seal-cutter, who understands the telegraph as Suddhoo cannot, has a friend in Peshawar who sends him the details before letters arrive. Suddhoo is worried at his son's health and invites the narrator to discuss it - specifically the prohibition on jadoo, or magic, by the Raj. The narrator reassures him that white magic is permitted, and that the officials of the Raj practise it themselves - Kipling adds, with more humour, ""(If the Financial Statement [roughly, the Budget of the government of India] isn't magic, I don't know what is)"". Suddhoo admits that he has paid much money for the 'clean sorcery' of the seal-cutter, who gets accurate reports ""more quickly than the lightning can fly"".

So they approach Suddhoo's house, hearing noises from the seal-cutter's window. They climb the darkened stairs, to Janoo's room, where there is more space. Then the magician enters, stripped to the waist, and puts on a most impressive performance, face white and eyes rolled back. The narrator recognises the fire-eating and the ventriloquism, and realises that, however impressive - and frightening - the performance is, it is a fraud, as Janoo says in her own language hearing him twice claim a very precise fee. (It is, of course, the central fraud in the tale.) She is upset that Suddhoo is spending all his money, some of which she had counted on acquiring (by ""wheedling"", which may be accounted as another form of deception).

Kipling summarises the narrator's problems: he has aided and abetted the seal-cutter in obtaining money under false pretences, so is guilty under British law; he cannot tackle the seal-cutter, as the latter will poison Janoo; and he fears that Janoo will poison the seal-cutter anyway. making him (the narrator) guilty as accessory to the act.

So deception is manifold.

92,384,2050-1-1 00:00:00,note_type4,"A Riot of Goldfish  (金魚撩乱) is a short story written by Japanese author Okamoto Kanoko in 1937.

Background
Okamoto Kanoko 岡本かの子 (1889-1939) wrote A Riot of Goldfish in 1937.  Okamoto was a Buddhist scholar, an aesthete, and a feminist, all of which influences appear in the text.  She was an active member of the feminist group Bluestockings (seitosha).  Also common in her work is water-related imagery, sensual descriptions of female beauty, the rejection of traditional female roles, an embellished prose style, and a unique use of language.
The protagonist in A Riot of Goldfish, Mataichi, attempts in vain to create the perfect goldfish.  This obsession with artistry is also seen in Okamoto's The Food Demon, in which the protagonist Besshiro strives to create the perfect culinary dish.  Goldfish breeding is still an art practiced in Japan.  Specialty goldfish mentioned in the text include the ranchū, Ryūkin, and Shūkin.  Okamoto utilizes the natural landscape of eastern Tokyo and the Kansai region to create stunning imagery.

Summary
The short story, set in early 20th-century Japan, follows the life of Mataichi, the adoptive son of a goldfish shop owner. The story begins in media res, with Mataichi reflecting upon his life and his obsession with Masako. 

As children, Maitaichi often teased and tormented Masako, driving her to the point of tears. Eventually, Masako fights back and throws a fistful of petals into Mataichi's face. After the fight, Mataichi changes his attitude towards Masako and falls in love with her. 

After graduating high school, Mataichi becomes a research student at a fisheries station in the Kansai region,  with an emphasis on domesticated fish. When Mataichi leaves Tokyo, he feels conflicting feelings of love and resentment towards Masako.  Mataichi becomes involved with Yoshie, the daughter of a fishing family. He flaunts his relationship with Yoshie in his letters to Masako and compares the two women. 

When Masako finally responds to his letters, she confesses that she is pregnant and engaged to be married soon. Mataichi becomes devastated by the news. After completing his field study, Mataichi focuses his entire energy on creating the perfect goldfish to mimic Masako's beauty. He spends over a decade on his attempt to produce a goldfish unrivaled in beauty. Finally, dispirited by his failures, Mataichi ventures to the pond where he keeps his unwanted, culled goldfish. The story ends with Mataichi's discovery of the ultimate goldfish in the muddy pond.

Characters
Mataichi is the protagonist of the story. His adoptive family owns a goldfish shop, which sparks his initial interest in fishery. Mataichi studies domesticated fishery in school. He becomes driven by the desire to create the perfect goldfish. Mataichi falls in love with Masako, a childhood friend.

Masako is Mataichi's primary love interest. Known as the ‘young Miss from the big house on the cliff’ (4). Masako is somewhat shy and inconspicuous as a girl. She grows into a beautiful lady. When Masako becomes pregnant she marries the father and starts a small family.

Sōjurō is Mataichi's adoptive father. He owns a goldfish shop and considers himself a so-called “specialist in goldfish” but lacks the skills to raise fancy varieties aside from the hibuna goldfish. He often compares Masako to a ranchū goldfish because of her slow and exaggerated movements. Sōjurō eventually closes shop and teaches ogiebushi singing instead.

Otsune is Mataichi's adoptive mother. She encourages Mataichi to find a wife and settle down.

Teizō is Masako's father. He is described as scrawny and dark complexioned. A rich man, Teizō lost his wife when Masako was young. Teizō keeps a mistress in a separate house. Teizō is a great lover of goldfish and one of Sōjurō's best customers. During the financial crisis in Japan, Teizō loses most of his wealth and decides to pour his remaining resources into breeding and selling goldfish. He becomes Mataichi's patron.

Yoshie is a woman who was briefly involved with Mataichi. Mataichi flaunts his relationship with Yoshie in front of Masako and often compares the two: “[Yoshie] is not as beautiful as [Masako], but she’s not as icy as [Masako is] either”(28).

Major themes

Buddhism
The author Okamoto Kanoko is a Buddhist scholar, which is reflected in her short story. The protagonist Mataichi is a secular man consumed by his desire for the beautiful girl Masako and driven by his ambitions to breed elaborative goldfish. He is not in the slightest a practitioner of Buddhism, which emphasizes emptiness and the need to break away from all worldly desires. The removal of all desire includes attachments to living beings: “The Dharma knows nothing of living beings, because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as ‘living beings'(38). Buddhism advocates detachment from other humans, including parents, friends, and family. However, Mataichi possesses a maniacal desire for Masako. He even attempts to breed a goldfish unparalleled in beauty to recreate Masako’s loveliness. Driven mad by his desires and ambitions, Mataichi ruins his reputation, his livelihood, and his life.

At the end of the story, Mataichi experiences a change of heart: “Having once fainted from shock and then recovered, Mataichi had entered a clear-headed trance. He remembered nothing and thought of nothing, but beheld the beauty of nature as it was, transforming into ecstasy itself” (52). Here is when the author's Buddhist influences become apparent. Mataichi's trance is amazingly similar to meditation, a common Buddhist practice to empty the mind and enter a state of complete tranquility. As Mataichi meditates and reflects upon his life, “Mataichi’s desire was gradually overcome, sucked out of him and scattered by sheer fascination” (53).  Mataichi frees himself and makes spiritual progress when he abandons his worldly desires. By the end of the story, Mataichi becomes free of his existential suffering and is at peace with the world.

Obsessions
Another central theme of the short story is obsession. Mataichi is driven by his obsessions: his obsession for the beautiful girl Masako and his obsession to create the perfect goldfish. These obsessions nearly drive Mataichi to ruin; by the end of the story, Mataichi appears older than his years.
“He was not yet thirty, but his body and mannerisms were those of someone already ravaged by age.”

Human manipulation of nature
Throughout the story, Mataichi attempts to create the perfect goldfish by genetically engineering goldfish and breeding different varieties of goldfish together. He is unsuccessful in his attempts of human manipulation of nature and the resulting goldfish are tossed into a small pond. Eventually, Mataichi visits the small pond to discover that nature has created what humans could not: the ideal goldfish.

Main scenes and events
Pivotal childhood encounter: After numerous encounters with Mataichi's incessant teasing, Masako finally retaliates.  To Mataichi, the girl who lives on the hill has started to bloom into a woman. 

Sponsorship: Teizō sponsors Mataichi's secondary vocational education at a school in the Kansai region.  At school, Mataichi is praised as an artist and he remains away from home for four years.

Correspondence between Tokyo and Kansai: Masako writes to Mataichi that she is pregnant and set to marry a man that Mataichi has never met.  In the same letter she mentions that she is more interested in the goldfish he will create than her future child.  Soon after, Teizō informs Mataichi that he is experiencing financial hardship and prefers that Mataichi stop treating his work scholarly and instead focus of the goldfish enterprise.  Mataichi becomes more determined to succeed in creating the perfect goldfish.  He knows that he and Masako will never be together.

Return to Tokyo:  Teizō calls Mataichi back to Tokyo due to financial hardship and Mataichi does not complete his degree.  He returns to his decrepit fishponds, which were damaged in the Great Kanto earthquake.  Without Masako in his life, he devotes himself entirely to goldfish.
Change: Teizō dies and his son takes over the business.  Due to the business' financial hardship, less money is give to Mataichi as he becomes more and more obsessed with creating the perfect goldfish.

Heavy rains: Rainstorms wash away the fishponds leaving everything behind in disarray.    The water sweeps Mataichi down the hill to the pond designated for rejected experiments.  Muck and debris left behind by the storm float in the pond.

Ending: In contrast to the beginning of the novel, which highlights Mataichi's repeated failures in goldfish breeding, Mataichi finds the one fish that he had desired to create for over ten years swimming amongst the sludge.  Mirroring the beginning, he finds himself in a reclining position on the mud, but now he is overwhelmed by a sense of peace.

Triple J programmesThe First Army Air Service was an Air Service, United States Army unit that fought on the Western Front during World War I as part of the Air Service, First United States Army.  The First Army Air Service was the largest and most diverse Air Service combat organization of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, and most American Air Service combat units were assigned to it when assigned to the front.

The organization was demobilized in France on 15 April 1919 with the demobilization of the United States First Army. It was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 15 October 1921 as Headquarters, First Army Air Service, assigned to the First Army and allotted to the First Corps Area. It was then allocated to the Regular Army in 1928, and then inactivated in December 1929.

History

Origins

The history of the First Army Air Service dates to the first American Air Service personnel arriving in France. On 15 January 1918, Colonel William Mitchell was appointed Chief of the Air Service, I Corps, First Army.  At this time, the I Corps was being formed for the purpose of administratively handling all of the American troops then on the Western Front.  Headquarters was located at Neufchâteau, France. When the first American Aero Squadrons arrived at the front in April 1918, they were assigned to the quiet Toul Sector. At this time, the American Air Service on the front consisted of only a few Aero Squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group.

At the end of June, 1918, Air Service, I Corps moved from the Toul Sector to the Château-Thierry Sector as part of I Corps.  The I Corps Observation Group was already in the Chateau-Thierry Sector was under the command of First Army.  The Assistant Chief of Air Service, Zone of Advance, felt it was necessary to coordinate the observation groups of First Army with the pursuit groups. On 10 August 1918, the First American Army Air Service was established.

Organization
The unit was formally organized on 26 August at Ligny-en-Barrois, France. It consisted of the French Aerial Division, which consisted of a large number of pursuit and day bombardment squadrons. In addition, there was one other French pursuit group and three American pursuit groups-one American day-bombardment group-the 1st Army observation, and one French Army artillery group for the adjustment of long-range artillery fire. Eight night-bombardment squadrons of the British Royal Air Force. were to cooperate with the First Army Air Service whenever the tactical situation made such action expedient.  The establishment of the First Army Air Service marked the first concentration of American air forces under its own commander.

The front of the First Army, extending from Châtillon-sous-les-Côtes to Pont-sur-Seille, insofar as aviation was concerned, had been very quiet for some time. The enemy performed his photographic
reconnaissances with single aircraft, flying at high altitudes, and his pursuit patrols were small and infrequent.  In the matter of aerodromes, the enemy was better off than the First American Army, and possessed many small fields within access of any part of the front line. Several aerodromes were unoccupied, and were in such condition that they could be utilized quickly by reinforcements, their barracks and hangars being more or less serviceable.

For the Americans, almost every available field had been taken up and they were short in hangars and billet space, so that by the time the allocation of aviation units had been made to the First Army, the problems of locating and housing the units was a serious one.

Corps Observation Groups

The Corps Air Service of each corps operating under First Army was made up of one squadron for each division and one squadron for the corps. The Air Service of the 2d Colonial Corps consisted entirely of French squadrons. The I Corps observation group was made up of the 1st, 12th, and 50th Aero Squadrons and two French squadrons. In the IV Corps group were the 8th, 135th, and 90th Aero Squadrons and one French squadron. The V Corps group consisted of the 88th, 99th, and 104th Aero Squadrons, only one of which had had a considerable experience in active front-line operations, the corps chief of Air Service and staff remained at the location of the group.

The I Corps group was located in the vicinity of Toul on two aerodromes. The 1st and 12th Aero Squadrons were stationed at Gengault Aerodrome just east of Toul, which had formerly been occupied by the 1st Pursuit Group in the spring of 1918. The 50th Aero and 211th (French) Squadrons occupied the newly constructed Bicqueley Aerodrome, just south of Toul. The IV Corps group entire occupied Ourches Aerodrome. The French squadrons of the Air Service of the 2d French Colonial Corps were located at Rumont, to the northeast of Bar-le-Duc. The V Corps group occupied Souilly Aerodrome.  With the exception of the V Corps group, each Corps Air Service was established and ready for operations by the first week in September. The V Corps group was not completed until the day of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, when the 88th Squadron arrived from the Vesle. The one new squadron of the I Corps group, the 50th Aero, had but recently arrived at the front. It was equipped with Airco DH.4 airplanes with the new Liberty engine. Two of the three American squadrons of the IV Corps group were also equipped with the De Havilland DH.4 Liberty; the 90th Squadron had French Salmson 2.A2 airplanes. In the V Corps group all squadrons were equipped with the Salmson.

First Army Observation Group
During the inactive period on the Toul sector covering the late spring and summer of 1918 and up to the St. Mihiel offensive which commenced on 12 September, army observation in the American Air Service was carried out by one unit, the 91st Aero Squadron.  The 91st served as a nucleus for the long-range reconnaissance missions for First Army; while the various Corps observation groups were used for battlefield, tactical observation missions. Previous to its assignment to the First Army, the 91st worked under orders of the Chef de I'Aeronautique of the 8th French Army. The group added two new aero squadrons, the 24th and the 9th, but as these had not had actual battle experience, they did little work other than perfecting their own training. The 91st Aero Squadron, therefore, took care of all of the long-range day reconnaissances.

1st Day Bombardment Group

1st Day Bombardment Group had its beginning 18 May 1918, when the 96th Aero Squadron, the first unit of day bombardment, was established at Amanty Aerodrome to begin active operations against the enemy. The flying equipment of the 96th Squadron consisted of ten Breguet 14B.2 bombing airplanes, equipped with 300 horsepower type 12 F. E. V. Renault motors.

The 1st Day Bombardment Group had a threefold object: the destruction of material, reconnaissance, and observation of enemy tactics in combat. Except during an offensive there was but little opportunity to attack massed troops. The principal mission during such a period was to destroy the enemy's transport lines by which supplies and personnel were delivered to the front, or by which ore and other products of military importance were delivered to the rear. The most favorable targets were the railroad centers where the traffic arteries converged. Long distance raids proved wonderful opportunities for deep reconnaissance, especially of enemy railroad movements. Any pronounced current of railroad traffic, going in one direction, or converging at one point, would be reported by every observer making that particular raid. Further confirmation was unnecessary, for the observers were obliged to submit their written raid reports without consulting each other. Photographs of the bursts often revealed troop and construction activity at the objectives, and were subject to careful interpretation.

1st Pursuit Wing

Two American pursuit groups were in process of organization for the establishment of the 1st Pursuit Wing. These were already located at Gengault and Vaucouleurs Aerodromes.

All of the American pursuit squadrons in existence, with the exception of the 17th and 148th Aero Squadrons, which were operating with the British, were concentrated in the 1st Pursuit Wing, with headquarters at Toul, and the 1st Pursuit Group, with headquarters at Rembercourt Aerodrome. The 1st Pursuit Wing consisted of the 2d and 3d Pursuit Groups; the 2d Pursuit Group composed of the 13th, 22d, 49th and 139th Aero Squadrons, and the 3d Pursuit Group consisted of the 28th, 93d, 103d, and 213th Aero Squadrons. The 1st Pursuit Group consisted of the 27th, 94th, 95th, and 147th Aero Squadrons. One French Group (G.C.16) was allocated to the 1st American Pursuit Wing commander for duty in connection with the offensive.

With these units at his disposal, and with the general conditions of the air program for the offensive in mind, the Chief of Air Service, First Army, made certain plans for the pursuit units for the attack. He decided to utilize the American pursuit all along the front for the purpose of protective barrage at all altitudes, with incidental duties as occasion arose, of a more combative nature, such as ground strafing, balloon destruction, and offensive patrols.  Offensive patrols cross the enemy line in sufficient strength to cruise over his rear area, search out enemy aircraft, and attack them, with the object of causing maximum casualties and inflicting the greatest possible damage to his air service, and with the further object of obtaining definite moral superiority.

St. Mihiel offensive

Preparation
In August 1918, the situation of the enemy in the St. Mihiel sector was approximately the same as that described in Toul sector. The sector of the front from Saint-Mihiel north to Châtillon-sous-les-Côtes was organized in approximately the same manner as the Toul or Saint-Mihiel sector. The enemy was favored by the terrain, which offered many natural positions of great strength. These positions had been well organized for a prolonged defense. Some intimation of an impending allied offensive in this sector had reached the enemy, and immediately preceding the attack of 12 September he commenced a redistribution of his available forces, especially with a view to echeloning them in depth. As far as was known at the time, the enemy strength in the sector remained about the same as it had been throughout the summer months.

In the air the strength of the enemy continued the same as it had been since the previous spring. A few pursuit patrols of Fokker airplanes were reported as operating in this sector, but it was quite probable that these were new airplanes received as replacements for the Albatross and Pfalz type formerly in use. Individual observation and photograph airplanes operated over the sector, but no unusual number of hostile aircraft was at any time encountered or reported before the opening of the Saint-Mihiel offensive.

The operations undertaken during the period of preparation. Visual reconnaissance, Photographic reconnaissance, Artillery fire adjustment, and Exercises with artillery and infantry.

Visual reconnaissance of the corps and division sectors was carried out as a routine matter at dawn and twilight of each day. A few other special visual reconnaissance missions were dispatched to secure information of a particular nature in well-defined areas. The work of visual reconnaissance was valuable only in that it kept the command informed at all times of the situation in the enemy lines opposite each corps. The information secured in this manner was for the most part of a negative nature, due to the inactivity of the enemy at this period, but it served the purpose of assuring the staff of each corps that there were no new developments in the general tactical situation.

Photographic reconnaissance, during the period of preparation, consisted for the most part of taking oblique views of the enemy territory immediately opposite the front lines of each corps. This type of photograph proved of great value in the preparation of detailed plans for the attack.

No great amount of adjustment of artillery fire took place, due to the necessity of veiling all preparations for the offensive. The shoots executed were therefore merely those necessary to register the fire of a few batteries on certain points.

Exercises were conducted as frequently as possible in each corps for the purpose of preparing the infantry and artillery to cooperate successfully with the airplane observer during the coming offensive. All operations were greatly hindered by the unfavorable weather which prevailed during the early days of September.

The 1st Day Bombardment Group was formed two days before the offensive opened, and included the 11th, 20th, and 96th Aero Squadrons. The 11th and 20th Squadrons had not completed their squadron organization. Some of their pilots and observers had seen action with the French squadrons, but most of them made their first flights over the lines during this offensive. The two new squadrons operated De Havilland DH.4 airplanes, with Liberty motors. The armament was the same as that of the French Breguet, save that the pilot had two Marlin machine guns, synchronized to shoot through the propeller. The De Havilland DH.4s carried the British Wimperis bomb sight attached to the outside of the fuselage. This sight permitted the observer to aim at the target while standing, a position which kept him in readiness to fight off an attack by hostile aircraft.

During the period preparatory to the attack, from 29 August to 12 September, the 1st Pursuit Wing, working on the front between the Meuse and the Moselle Rivers, maintained patrols sufficient to prevent any reconnaissance, visual or photographic, of the area Lionville, Beuconville, Domeurs, Francheville, Becq and Gironville. The Wing commander divided the sector for this purpose into two areas, the western running from St. Mihiel to Essey, both inclusive, and the eastern, Seicheprey to Pont-sur-Seille, both inclusive, and gave orders that a double tier barrage should be maintained from daylight to dark over these sectors. The low patrol, acting at from 2,500 to 3,500 meters, and the higher patrol at from 3,500 to 5,500 meters. Each patrol overlapped by 15 minutes, and were not permitted to penetrate over the enemy lines more than five kilometers. By 5 September, the wing had made an area approximately 5 kilometers over the enemy's lines practically safe for corps observation machines to operate. Some close protection work was ordered to act in cooperation with the army reconnaissance squadron, and one particularly dangerous balloon near Mont Sec was attacked repeatedly.

Operations
The St. Mihiel offensive is chiefly remarkable in that it was the first all-American large scale operation of World War I. During the four days of the American offensive which cleared the St. Mihiel salient of the enemy, weather conditions, except on 14 September, were such as to greatly hinder the carrying out of aerial operations.

Tactical Reconnaissance

On the morning of 12 September, when the attack was launched, a heavy mist, low-lying cloud banks, and intermittent rain combined to make all aerial observation extremely difficult. Notwithstanding this fact, command airplanes for the corps and divisions, infantry contact patrols, and artillery surveillance airplanes performed their respective missions throughout the hours of daylight. The command was thus kept informed of the general progress of the battle and at periodic intervals was given the first line of our advancing troops located by observers executing the missions of infantry contact. Missions operating in cooperation with the artillery were unable, on account of atmospheric conditions, to accomplish much work of value in the regulation of artillery fire on fugitive targets, but, taking advantage of momentary gaps in the clouds and mist, they were able to observe and report upon the location of such targets from time to time and to furnish other information of considerable value to the artillery. The work accomplished on 13 September was virtually a repetition of that of the 12th, for the same unfavorable weather conditions continued.

14 September was the one day during the offensive which was favorable for the conduct of aerial operations by the Corps Air Service. Missions of every type were dispatched, throughout the hours of daylight. Command airplanes, infantry contact patrols, and visual reconnaissance missions kept the command well informed as to the progress of the attacking troops and of the situation within the enemy lines to a depth of 8 kilometers. Photographic missions were executed and resulted in a large number of successful photographs of the enemy's front-line positions. Artillery surveillance airplanes secured much valuable information which was immediately sent by radio to the artillery posts of command and later confirmed by both dropped messages and telephonic reports upon the return of the observer to the aerodrome. Some successful adjustments of the fire of designated batteries upon fugitive targets located in the enemy lines were accomplished. From early morning of the 14th there was a very noticeable increase of hostile pursuit aviation. Some of the best enemy flights operated along the sector and observation airplanes were repeatedly attacked, but in the majority of cases successfully defended themselves and accomplished their assigned missions. On 15 September, unfavorable weather again greatly hindered aerial operations; the work done was similar to that accomplished during the first two days of the offensive.

Strategic Reconnaissance
Targets were indicated by the Chief of Staff, First Army for strategic reconnaissance missions deep behind German lines to be carried out by the First Army Observation Group.  These targets were various artillery objectives, to be photographed just before and on every day during the attack until further notice. A continuous barrage of observation planes was to be maintained over enemy territory throughout the entire day. Formations of three planes were scheduled to leave the aerodrome at intervals of two hours, beginning at daybreak, to reconnoiter the enemy's rear areas. It was considered necessary to employ formations of at least three planes, as there was no pursuit protection available and the friendly pursuit patrols did not penetrate the enemy lines to the same depth that the army reconnaissance planes were required to go. It was certain all these planes would be vigorously attacked by enemy aircraft.

However, owing to the prevailing adverse weather conditions, it was necessary to disregard the schedules that were prepared the preceding day as the low hanging clouds rendered formation flying impossible. Photography was out of the question. Single planes were dispatched whenever the weather permitted. The planes were required to fly at low altitudes, under the clouds but proved successful, in that they could climb into the clouds and to safety in case of the appearance of enemy aircraft, or when especially heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire was encountered.  During the first day the enemy territory was successfully reconnoitered to a depth of 60 kilometers. Not one mission was carried out at an altitude exceeding 1,000 meters. This was accomplished without the loss of a single plane or even a single casualty.  However, because of the rapid increase in numbers of enemy pursuit planes as the battle progressed, the successful reconnoitering of the enemy back areas became extremely difficult.  The reinforcing enemy pursuit was largely equipped with the Fokker D VII scouts. This plane had a considerable advantage in climbing speed over the Salmson. However, the horizontal speed of the latter plane was greater at high altitudes, thereby enabling it to break off a combat at any desirable time.  The effective work done and the comparatively small number of casualties suffered during the St. Mihiel offensive, gave evidence of the excellent training and experience gained during the previous three months.

Day Bombardment

Bombing operations during the offensive were directed against hostile troops concentrations immediately behind the enemy's lines as primary objectives, and raids to railroads centers which were congested with troops and supplies as secondary objectives. To interfere with traffic of reinforcements and supplies from the sector east of the Moselle river it was found expedient to send bombing expeditions against the bridges, and bridgeheads, between Pont-a-Mousson and Metz. The main object of day bombardment during the offensive was to throw into confusion and destroy enemy troops marching into, or retreating from battle. During the days of exploitation the bombers continued to hamper as much as possible the enemy's withdrawal of personnel and material.

Late at night, 11 September, orders were received to hold the 9th Aero Squadron on the alert early in the morning, to bomb and machine gun hostile troops in front of our advancing infantry. To carry out these orders the twelve available Breguets were divided into flights of four each. The plan was to send the flights over to attack at 30-minute intervals, and thus keep up the enemy troops under a continuous bombardment. The first order to raid was received at 10 A.M. The objective was troop concentration at Buxieres, in the town and along the roads radiating from it. Because of the strong wind and the low cloud ceiling it was considered impracticable to attempt even these small formation flights. Consequently, that the order be obeyed, the leading team of the first flight volunteered to attempt the mission alone, and to determine, if possible, the best method of conducting troop bombing under the existing unfavorable conditions. The team did not return. It was later learned that the Breguet came down in flames south of Commercy, while returning to the aerodrome. The mission had been accomplished. After this first loss of the offensive it was decided to send all the airplanes on single missions, and not dissipate the strength of the squadron in small formations.

The casualties of the bombers were heavy. The 96th Aero Squadron lost sixteen pilots and observers during the first four days of the attack, which is a high percentage of loss even in a day bombardment unit. The 11th Aero Squadron lost twelve of its flying personnel, and the 20th Aero Squadron three. The total casualties of the group for the offensive numbered thirty-one.  However, the work done by day bombardment during the St. Mihiel offensive is worthy of praise. The terrific weather made formation flying, upon which bombing depends, almost impossible. The muddy flying field caused so many broken propellers that the formations which crossed the lines were never large enough for self-protection. The main lesson learned from this offensive was that large formations must be employed by day bombardment when the enemy aircraft opposition is strong and persistent. As it was impossible to obtain sufficient replacements in airplanes and spare parts the formations were small and the losses heavy.

1st Pursuit Wing

On 12 September, throughout the day there were high winds, and rain fell intermittently. The usual functions of the pursuit aviation could not be performed, but the pursuit planes were used to secure valuable information and to harass by machine-gun and bombs the retreating enemy. Many favorable objectives presented themselves, especially over the Vigneville-Chambley and the Vigneulles St. Benoit roads. The 3d Pursuit Group, equipped its airplanes with bombs, and an these roads, together with assistance of the machine guns of the 2nd and 1st Pursuit Groups, constantly threw into confusion the retreating German forces.  Owing to weather conditions on the opening day, few large patrols were used, and many individual reconnaissances were made by pursuit pilots of the lst, 2d and 3d Group. Often single aircraft determined and reported the advance of our front line, actually flying down to 50 meters, and co-operating with the troops on the ground.

By 13 September, shortly after midnight, infantry patrols from the south and those from the west met near Vigneulles. Still the enemy was in retreat. The Chambley, Mars-la-Tour road was jammed with his reinforcements coming up and his wagons in retreat. In one day the 3d Pursuit Group made five expeditions bombing and harassing with machine guns, protected by elements of the 2nd Pursuit Group. The 1st Pursuit Group on its sector harassed the infantry, maintaining protective patrols above at different altitudes. But, it was not until 14 September, when the weather cleared, that pursuit aviation was able to operate at its normal altitude.  Enemy Balloons were attacked with determination, and massed enemy troops withdrawn on 12, 13 and 14 September were harassed and repeatedly thrown into confusion. Large enemy formations of aircraft when they appeared were fought gallantly even by inferior members, and every opportunity of making observations from pursuit planes was seized with eagerness.

Meuse-Argonne Offensive

Reorganization
Shortly after the conclusion of the St. Mihiel offensive a certain redistribution of units took place between the various Corps Air Services in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The three American Army Corps which were to take part in the main offensive were the I, III and V. The IV Corps was to be enlarged to include the former sector of the I Corps. The IV Corps, the 2d French Colonial Corps, and the 33d French Corps were to remain in place and not take part in the main offensive.

One American Aero squadron was relieved from the Air Service of the IV Corps, leaving the 8th and
135th Aero Squadrons and one French squadron in the group at Ourches Aerodrome. The Air Service of the 2d French Colonial Corps was composed of the same squadrons as had participated in the St. Mihiel
offensive. The Air Service of the 33d French Corps was made up of French squadrons with headquarters at Beauzee.

The III Corps Observation Group was located on the aerodromes at Souilly Aerodrome, Vavincourt Aerodrome, and Beauzee Aerodromes. The group comprised the 88th and 90th Aero Squadrons and three French squadrons. The V Corps Observation Group included the 99th and 186th Aero Squadrons and two French squadrons. The V Corps Observation Group was established at Foucaucourt Aerodrome. The I Corps Observation Group, located at Remicourt Aerodrome, was made up of three American squadrons, the lst, 12th, and 50th Aero Squadron, and one French squadron.

The 1st Day Bombardment Group was used to attack from high altitudes, large objectives such as towns and railroad stations from which traffic is radiating.  In situations when intelligence received that specially favorable targets are presenting themselves within 6 or 8 kilometers of our front lines, this group was ordered to attack such targets at low altitude in order to cause confusion and material damage to enemy elements arriving as reinforcements or retreating.

The enemy air service was largely concentrated in the Conflans-Briey area, and the period between 14 and 25 September was marked by severe and repeated combats. Between 20 and 23 September, the 2d, and 3d Pursuit Groups of the 1st Pursuit Wing changed station[, but this changing station was not allowed to interfere with operations which were still carried on over the front created by the St. Mihiel battle. The 1st Pursuit Group remained at Rembercourt Aerodrome but it too confined its operations to the sector east of the Meuse. G.C. 16 of the French Army was relieved from duty with the 1st Pursuit Wing. The wing headquarters moved from Toul to Chaumont-sur-Aire; the 2d Pursuit Group moved from Gengault Aerodrome to the Belrain Aerodrome, and the 3d Pursuit Group moved from the Vaucouleurs Aerodrome to the Lisle-en-Barrois Aerodrome. The wing headquarters and its groups perfected liaison with the corps air service, the army observation group, and the armies to the right and left of the 1st Army.

For the Argonne-Meuse offensive, the 1st Pursuit Group was allotted the rather new task of combating enemy battle flights and of destroying balloons. In other words, all of its operations were confined to extremely low altitudes during the morning hours.  However, its squadrons were available for an offensive operation in the afternoon, and vice versa. The group assigned to patrol in the afternoon will be on the alert in the morning to carry out an offensive operation, in which the entire group may be called upon to participate at medium and high altitudes, penetrating about 12 kilometers beyond our advancing lines to clean the air of enemy aviation.

The 2d and 3d Pursuit Groups were assigned the mission to maintain protective patrols within the enemy's lies for the defense of our army corps air service and to attack enemy reconnaissance planes, but it will also be necessary from time to time to take the offensive with a display of dominating force, sending out powerful expeditions so as to cover intermediate and high altitudes and to sweep the air clear of enemy aviation up to a depth, 10 or 12 kilometers inside the lines.  Most of the enemy aviation is concentrated in the region of Metz, especial attention will be paid to the sector between the Meuse and Chatillon.

Operations
The unfavorable weather encountered during the St. Mihiel Offensive continued the greater part of the time between 26 September and 11 November. There were occasional ideal flying days, but for the most part weather conditions were poor to impossible and proved a great handicap in carrying out aerial operations. Haze and fog obscured the ground to a great extent in the early morning and late afternoon during the last four weeks of the offensive.

Tactical Reconnaissance

In considering the work performed by the Corps Observation Groups these weather conditions must be kept in mind as an element which affected the execution of each type of mission. In the matter of reconnaissance and infantry contact patrol work they produced some radical departures from the methods ordinarily used.

The photographic missions undertaken during the period from 26 September to 11 November were in almost every case confined to the taking of photographs of well-defined areas of particular interest to the G-2 section of the corps and Army staffs. Atmospheric conditions were so infrequently favorable to the taking of large numbers of photographs that those possible were necessarily directed to cover areas of the most immediate interest to the staff.  A considerable number of missions were devoted to the securing of oblique photographs, as had been the case during the preparation of the St. Mihiel offensive. Such photographs were of value particularly with respect to the preparation of plans for the advance of the divisional infantry. At other times, it became necessary to photograph certain sensitive points in the enemy territory. Such
missions, which require the greatest care, were assigned to flying teams of long experience. To attain success in them it was necessary that both pilot and observer be thoroughly familiar with the exact locality to be photographed so that no mistake would be made in securing photographs of the exact points desired. Unfavorable weather prevailed, to such an extent that it was never practical to attempt to photograph all the area of the front lines as fast as the troops advanced.

In this offensive, as had been the case on the Marne, photographic missions were invariably given protection against attacking hostile pursuit airplanes. The large number of enemy pursuit flights operating in the sector made it practically certain that a photographic mission would be attacked one or more times during the course of the flight. Protection by pursuit patrols from the nearest pursuit group was utilized to a large extent by photographic missions dispatched from the III Corps Observation Group, and with excellent results. On the other hand, the missions of a like nature sent out from the I and V Corps groups employed for the most part biplace protection offered by airplanes from the groups themselves.  The pursuit protection, however, ceased to operate close in to the photographic airplane as in the Mame sector. It was found that better results could be obtained by flying a more or less erratic course some 500 meters above the photographic airplane. This method allowed the pursuit airplanes to retain the advantage of their maneuverability and at the same time to assure to the photographic mission considerable protection in the event of attack.

Strategic Reconnaissance
The attack commenced on the morning of 26 September with ideal weather conditions. On the four days previous low clouds and rain had prevented any effective work from being carried out. This had a decided effect on the first days work, due to lack of familiarity with the terrain. This fact, coupled with the activity of the hostile air forces, interfered greatly with the success of the photographing of the artillery objectives, and to some extent with the visual work.

Weather conditions throughout the whole operations were extremely bad. Only ten days out of the whole period were suitable for army strategic observation. The most was made of the small amount of good weather, and with two-day squadrons operating an immense amount of work was accomplished. The last three days of October being
perfect, gave opportunity for very important work to be accomplished in preparation for the attack, which commenced on 1 November. The areas opposite the American front were reconnoitered and photographed thoroughly, but the work was done in the face of intense opposition by hostile aircraft.

One of the most valuable pieces of work carried out during the last three days of October was the photographing of the army artillery objectives at Montmedy, Longuyon, Spincourt, Dommary-Baroncourt and Conflans. The enemy had protected these points by intense antiaircraft barrages, and high patrols of pursuit planes, but in spite of these obstacles, the objectives were photographed both before and after registration fire, allowing the artillery to fire effectively during the attack.  The missions assigned varied in character; from verifying reports as to the location of the front lines, to the seeking out of enemy reserves at points where counter-attacks were expected. This work was carried out by single planes flying at extremely low altitudes. The command planes sometimes penetrated hostile territory to a depth of 15 kilometers, and were constantly exposed to heavy machine gun and anti-aircraft artillery fire. They were especially liable to attack by pursuit planes which had every advantage of speed, maneuverability, and position. The strain of flying under these conditions coupled with the necessarily close confinement while awaiting orders, made it necessary that the teams be changed every ten days, and personnel from each of the squadrons in the group
were sent out on this work successfully.

Night Reconnaissance
Night Reconnaissance work promised to bring in valuable information, since most military movements of importance are made at night. In order that it may be performed successfully, perfect conditions of visibility and a highly trained personnel were necessary.

The 9th Aero Squadron was the only night reconnaissance unit in the American Air Service. The poor weather conditions throughout the Argonne-Meuse operation gave little opportunity for the squadron to work. In addition, only a very few of the flyers had been trained for night work. In spite of these handicaps it is only fair to say that on the few nights suitable for observation, information of value was obtained, and considerable damage done to the enemy by bombing.

Day Bombardment

The objectives for bombardment in the Meuse Argonne Offensive were similar to those of the St. Mihiel offensive. The 1st Day Bombardment Group was used to attack, from high altitudes where possible, such towns as Romagne, St. Juvin, Grandpre, Bantheville, and Dun-sur-Meuse, and railroad centers from which traffic was radiating.

Early in the offensive missions were carried out against troop concentrations between the Meuse River and the Argonne forest. When intelligence was received of favorable targets within six or eight kilometers of the lines, the group was ordered to attack such objectives at low altitude to cause the maximum amount of confusion and damage to the enemy elements as reinforcements for retreating before our infantry.

With the increase of formation strength, and improvement in skill of the bombing personnel, the group wrought telling havoc on the objectives of the Argonne-Meuse. Fires were frequently started with incendiary bombs. Due to the incessant cloudy weather most of the early raids were made at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The antiaircraft fire of the enemy was so accurate that the flight leaders found it necessary to fly at least 500 meters below the background of clouds.

4 October was a very successful day for the bombers. Dun-sur-Meuse was hit with a ton and a half of bombs, and Landres St. Georges with a like amount. The combats of the day were severe. In each attack the enemy numbered about thirty Fokkers and Pfalz. The
clouds were low and afforded many lurking pockets for the enemy pursuit. In the last flight the 96th Aero Squadron was attacked by the full formation of enemy airplanes. The bombing squadron tightened up and kept the pursuers at bay until the 26th Aero Squadron and 11th Aero Squadron attacked the Fokkers and Pfalz in the rear. Two of the enemy were seen to go down. When the combat was the hottest thirty Spads from the 2d Pursuit Group arrived on schedule time and joined in the general fight. The enemy was in a trap and could not escape combat with all our forces. The Spads brought down eleven of the enemy, bringing the total of victories of the fight up to thirteen.

Another highly successful raid was the shock attack on Bayonville, 18 October, on which the group dropped four tons of bombs. The bombs burst in the middle of the town. It was later learned that on this single raid 250 of the enemy troops were killed by our bombs and 750 wounded. According to instructions from headquarters the bombing squadrons returned by way of St. Juvin to encourage our infantry. A successful raid was made by the group on Montmedy, 4 November. Numerous fires were started and great damage done to buildings and warehouses.

The hottest combat of the offensive was fought on returning from this mission. Two airplanes of the 11th Aero Squadron went down in flames. Six of the enemy were shot down, two in flames. The last mission of the offensive was a raid on Mousson, on which good hits were made. On this last raid the 20th Aero Squadron lost three planes. Four of the enemy went down in flames or out of control.

During the Meuse-Argonne operations the 1st Day Bombardment Group was distinguished for success in precision bombing. Enemy troops were attacked, material was destroyed, and the morale of the enemy so shaken that formations of bombers became the source of constant dread. Statistics of the air service show that two-thirds of the enemy airplanes brought down, during the offensive, were brought down by, or in conjunction with day bombardment.

1st Pursuit Wing

The low work of the 1st Pursuit Group justified its introduction on the first day of the Argonne-Meuse attack, 26 September. Ten enemy balloons were shot down in flames on that date. The constant destruction and harassing of the enemy's balloons by the group resulted in the enemy detailing a certain force at all times for their protection, and he made many ingenious attempts to trap our pilots who were attacking his balloons. This resulted in counter schemes being employed in which not only were attacks on balloons carried out, but a number of enemy airplanes were brought down by the group. While many successful balloon attacks were made in the early morning and throughout the day, the most successful attacks were those carried on in the dusk of the evening.

The 1st Pursuit Group in addition to its attacks on enemy balloons and its defensive work in destroying German battle-planes, was enabled to use shock action at low altitudes by means of a concentrated patrol of all squadrons which was made about three o’clock every afternoon.

The policy employed with respect to the 1st Pursuit Wing of using large forces for shock action deep in the enemy's side of the lines, justified itself on the first day of the American attack in the Argonne Meuse area, 26 September. The first group sortie was made by the 2d Pursuit Group at dawn of 26 September and resulted in the destruction of 8 enemy airplanes. A similar sortie by the 3d Pursuit Group on the afternoon of 26 September resulted in the destruction of 3 more enemy planes.

One of the most successful shock operations carried out by the 1st Pursuit Wing was carried out on 18 October in which two squadrons of the 2d Pursuit Group, equipped with bombs and machine guns for the purpose of harassing group objectives flying
at an extremely low altitude, two squadrons of the 3d Pursuit Group at between 2,000 and 3,000 meters, all four squadrons of the 1st Day Bombardment Group at 4,000 meters, and two more squadrons of the 3d Pursuit Group, flying at 4,500 meters, met at the previously appointed rendezvous of Bayonville at 3:30 in the afternoon. The enemy appeared in force, some 30 or 40 enemy planes being seen by our pilots. Their formation was broken up, at least nine of them were destroyed, and the others forced to return to their aerodromes. It is not to be forgotten that throughout the Argonne-Meuse operations both the 2d Pursuit Group and the 3d Pursuit Group were equipped with bombs for use in attacking ground objectives.

During the offensive, a night pursuit squadron (185th Aero Squadron) was added to the 1st Pursuit Group for the purpose of attacking enemy bombers. The details connected with the organization of this service presented a whole series of new and difficult problems which were satisfactorily solved. After the introduction of the night pursuit squadron, very few night bombardment attacks were undertaken by the enemy. In a few cases our night pursuit pilots were able to come within range of the enemy raiders. The night pursuit squadron combined offensive tactics with its defense against enemy bombers, bombs on enemy posts of command and concentration of troops.

In addition to its offensive shock patrols, the 1st Pursuit Wing carried on the more conventional protective patrols for which provision was made in the plan of employment, and also afforded a certain amount of close protection to the army corps observation
planes. The imperative necessity of extremely close liaison with the corps air services in the carrying out of these missions was emphasized, and the policy was adopted in October of having the corps observation planes which were to receive close protection from pursuit planes, land on the aerodrome of the pursuit group assigned to give protection, so that the observation airplane crew and the pursuit patrol leader could come to a definite understanding of the work to be done and the methods of doing it.

Demobilization and service 1922-29
On 11 November 1918, all offensive flying ended at 11:00am in compliance with the Armistice with Germany.  As part of the Armistice, Allied Forces were to occupy the Rhineland area of Germany beginning on 1 December.  The Third Army Air Service was established to be the air component of the United States Third Army. Units from the First Army AS contributed to over half the strength of Third Army AS, consisting of eight Aero Squadrons, and the headquarters of the III Corps Observation Group, and the VII Corps Observation Group.

Partially due to the suddenness of the Armistice, it took several months to demobilize the Air Service in France. An order of precedence based upon length of service on the front had to be made, staging camps for processing the men and personnel, and ships had to be obtained for transporting the men and materiel back to the United States, consisting of men both in the Zone of the Advance (Western Front) as well as in the Services of Supply (Rear Areas). Demobilization of men and units proceeded, until finally, on 13 April 1919, orders were received from the Chief of the Air Service in France that the Headquarters, First Army Air Service was to demobilize.  Six Aero Squadrons, amongst the last to arrive at the front, were to be sent to the Rhineland to reinforce or relieve units of the Third Army Air Service, the remainder to proceed to Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome, France for demobilization.

Headquarters was officially demobilized on 15 April 1919, its men arriving in the United States by the end of May and either were transferred to Air Service units or returned to Civilian life.

The organization was (re)-constituted in the Organized Reserve 15 October 1921 as Headquarters, First Army Air Service, assigned to the First Army and allotted to the First Corps Area. Headquarters initiated in November 1922 at Dover, NH. It was withdrawn from the Organized Reserve and First Corps Area on 5 September 1928 and allotted to the Regular Army. Inactivated on 9 December 1929 at Dover by relief of personnel.

History
The Southwark Rail-Road was chartered on April 2, 1831. The company constructed tracks in 1835, along Broad Street from South Street to Washington Avenue, and along Washington Avenue {Prime} from Broad Street to the Delaware River. At the intersection of Broad Street and Washington Avenue, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad ended at the Southwark Rail-Road. The PW&B's passenger station was just west of Broad Street; the Southwark Rail-Road was intended for freight, and was leased to and operated by the PW&B. At the South Street end, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad continued north on Broad Street.

The tracks on Broad Street were removed in 1870. Around the same time, tracks were built along the riverfront from the yard at the river north to Almond Street (now Kenilworth Street), connecting it to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Delaware Extension.

On March 28, 1877, the Southwark Rail-Road was merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, along with several other railroads. In 1881, the Pennsylvania Railroad bought up the majority of the PW&B's stock. The company was later merged into the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, another PRR subsidiary.

Taxonomy articles created by PolbotTyphoon Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea in 43 years. It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression, the 15th named storm, and the 10th typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. It developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. On August 26, the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000 people without power and caused two fatalities. Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at  in Tokushima Prefecture.

After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10 minute sustained). It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front. Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at  in Gangneung. A 24-hour total of  in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized. Over 17,000 houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233 people, making it the deadliest typhoon there in over 43 years, and caused $4.2 billion in damage. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000 people homeless and killing three. Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions. The typhoon later became extratropical over eastern Russia on September 1, dissipating three days later.

Meteorological history

The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on August 22 north of Bikini Atoll and southwest of Wake Island. It moved to the west-northwest, a movement it would maintain for much of its duration. Early on August 23, it intensified into Tropical Storm Rusa, about  east of Guam. At 1800 UTC on August 25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Rusa to a typhoon while the system was northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. The next day, the agency estimated that the typhoon attained peak winds of 150 km/h (90 mph 10 minute sustained). Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak winds of 215 km/h (135 mph 1 minute sustained).

While at peak intensity, Rusa struck the Japanese island of Amami Ōshima. After maintaining the peak winds for about 12 hours, Rusa weakened slightly as it continued to the west-northwest, but on August 28 the JMA again reported the typhoon attained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph 10 minute sustained). Despite forecasts that it would weaken, Rusa maintained its intensity while passing south of Japan, due to minimal wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of up to . The typhoon again weakened slightly on August 29 while passing between the Amami Islands and Japan. Thereafter, Rusa turned to the north toward the Korean Peninsula. Warm, moist air blew across the peninsula ahead of the storm, which prevented significant weakening, and an approaching cold front contributed to atmospheric instability. At around 0800 UTC on August 31, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea, with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10 minute sustained). According to the JTWC, Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to hit the country since 1959. The typhoon rapidly weakened while crossing the country, deteriorating into a tropical depression early on September 1. Around that time, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the system. The depression turned to the northeast, and after moving through the Sea of Japan, Rusa became extratropical over Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East late on September 1. The extratropical remnants continued northeast and dissipated on September 4 over the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Preparations and impact

Although damage was heaviest in South Korea, Typhoon Rusa first affected Japan. The threat from the storm prompted the Okinawa government to cancel a disaster drill for the island. On the island, high seas from Rusa left two United States marines missing; a later news report included the two missing as storm-related fatalities. In the Anami Islands, Rusa destroyed six houses, forcing 38 people to evacuate. The storm left 20,000 people without power and cancelled several flights. Winds reached  in Nomozaki, Nagasaki. Rains fell for seven days in the country, peaking at  in Tokushima Prefecture. The heaviest of the precipitation fell in Nara Prefecture, where a station reported  in one hour. At least 275 houses were flooded, and 137 houses were damaged. During its passage, Rusa injured 12 people, 4 seriously. The typhoon also produced light rain and high seas along the coast of Taiwan.

Before Rusa affected South Korea, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued high sea warnings on August 29. Airports were closed in the southern portion of the country, and dams let out water to prevent excessive flooding. Typhoon Rusa affected much of South Korea with heavy rainfall and high winds. Jeju Island off the country's southern coast reported  of rainfall, producing flash flooding that flooded cars. On the island, high winds downed trees and left 60,000 people without power. All lower and middle schools on the island were closed, and residents were stranded after officials halted ferry and airline service. On the South Korean mainland, winds reached as high as . High amounts of rainfall were reported on Jeju Province and along the country's southern coast, although the heaviest rainfall was only reported in a small region. In Gangneung, located in the eastern portion of the country, severe thunderstorms developed due to high instability resulting from humid air from the east interacting with the Taebaek Mountains, producing high amounts of precipitation. The city reported the highest rainfall total in the country with , of which  was observed in one day. The total represented 62% of Gangneung's average yearly rainfall, and became the highest daily rainfall in the country's history, exceeding the previous record set in 1981 by . In the South Korea interior, rainfall rates were considered a 1 in 200 year event.

Damage in South Korea was estimated at $4.2 billion (₩5.15 trillion KRW). Damage was heaviest in Gangneung, where about 36,000 homes and 622 military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16 jet fighters. Along the coast, high winds damaged 640 boats and about 200,000 marine buildings, and 265 industrial buildings were also damaged. The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung. Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure; the storm destroyed 274 bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164 locations. Rusa killed 300,000 livestock and flooded 85,000 hectares (210,000 acres) of crop fields, representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables. The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early, and a stadium to be used for the 2002 Asian Games was damaged. Across the country, 88,625 people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon, and 17,046 houses were damaged. High winds left 1.25 million people after blowing down 24,000 power lines. There were 213 deaths in the country, and another 33 were missing and presumed dead; This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43 years.

In neighboring North Korea, Rusa produced winds of  and heavy rainfall reaching  in mountainous areas of Kangwon Province; rainfall totaled  in the county of Kosong. The rains caused flash flooding and increased surface runoff. This occurred about a month after similarly heavy rains caused severe damage in the country. The rains from Rusa damaged and flooded thousands of houses and many public buildings, and destroyed 86,000 tonnes of crop fields; the latter was most significant due to the country's ongoing famine conditions. Damage was heaviest in Kangwon Province, and the typhoon affected four provinces and one administrative city. More than 26,000 people were left homeless in the country, although advance warning allowed for evacuations. Rusa disrupted transportation by destroying 25 km (16 mi) of roads and 24 bridges; however, most of the damage was isolated to a small region. There were three deaths in North Korea.

The typhoon also affected the Russian Far East. On Sakhalin island, Rusa's remnants dropped heavy rainfall, the equivalence of two months average precipitation. The rains flooded 350 houses, but there were no deaths in the region.

Aftermath
Following the storm, damaged buildings polluted rivers in South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000 soldiers to assist in cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies were sent to the affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49 million in donations (₩58 billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680 meals to 16,919 families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60 million (₩72.1 billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September 13, the South Korean government declared 203 cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714 families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300 million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69 houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for a small portion of the overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74 billion in damage and 117 deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.

In North Korea, the Red Cross provided relief supplies to residents affected by flooding. The agency's international disaster relief fund provided FR75,000 (2002 CHF (US$50,000).. Soldiers were used to assist in search and rescue missions and to repair damaged infrastructure. Due to storm damage, the Red Cross in North Korea distributed over 2.1 million water purification tablets and over 11,000 water containers. The agency also provided 32,753 blankets and 4,931 kitchen units. After the storm, people left homeless by the storm sought shelter with neighbors or in shelters. A South Korean dairy company donated 42,000 cans of baby formula to North Korea.

The name Rusa was retired after its usage in 2002, and was replaced with Nuri in 2004.

He was played by Rossi Higgins in 1993, and then by Frankie Fitzgerald from 2000 to 2001.

Storylines

1993
Ashley first appears after his mother Zoe (Elizabeth Chadwick) arrives in Walford to inform his grandmother, Dot (June Brown) of his existence. Dot goes to meet 9-year-old Ashley where he becomes close to his grandmother. Dot is eventually persuaded to leave Walford to live with Zoe, Ashley and her son Nick (John Altman) in Gravesend.

Dot leaves Gravesend and returns to Walford in 1997 without Ashley or his parents and reveals that Ashley and Zoe have moved to London to get away from Nick, after he was sent to prison for drug offences.

2000–2001
Ashley (now played by Frankie Fitzgerald) returns to the square briefly in July 2000 to visit Dot for a few days. It is obvious he has taken after his father when he gets up to mischief. Nick is later released from prison and reunites with Ashley and Zoe (now played by Tara Ellis) in the special spin-off episode titled ""Return of Nick Cotton"". Ashley leaves to go with Nick despite Zoe's reluctance so he and Nick get into a stolen car and decide to travel before returning to Walford. When they return to Walford and settle in with Dot, Ashley is under the influence of his villainous father Nick by taking drugs and gets involved in robberies with Nick. After Nick falls off some scaffolding, due to Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) spiking his drink, he orders Ashley to set fire to Mark's house, but Ashley cannot go through with it and leaves after Nick disowns him. Nick contacts Ashley a few months later and they reconcile. Their bond resumes until a fateful summer evening in June 2001 when Ashley steals Mark's motorbike after an argument with him in The Queen Vic, unaware that Nick had cut the bike's brakes the previous night in hope of killing Mark. Nick, Dot and Mark's mother Pauline (Wendy Richard) shout at Ashley to stop but he is unable to do so until he comes face-to-face with a pedestrian. Ashley swerves to avoid the pedestrian and brakes sharply, but the motorbike flips over a pavement and Ashley crashes into the laundrette. 17-year-old Ashley dies instantly and Nick is riddled with guilt. Dot later overhears an argument between Mark and Nick, discovering that Nick is responsible for Ashley's death. After Ashley's funeral, Dot confronts Nick and throws him out of the house.

Casting
Writing for The People in July 2000, Sharon Marshall revealed Ashley would be returning to EastEnders now played by Frankie Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was appearing in a variety show when he was spotted by a talent scout who suggested he send some photos to the BBC's casting department. A few months later, Fitzgerald was asked to audition  for the role of Ashley. While on his way home from the audition, Fitzgerald was told he had won the part. Marshall revealed Fitzgerald was hired after producers noted his resemblance to John Altman, who plays his on screen father, Nick. An EastEnders spokesperson said ""They could easily be father and son. They've got the same brooding dark-haired looks."" Marshall said Fitzgerald was set to ""steal the show - as well as a few young Walford hearts"" as Ashley. She also stated the character would be a chip off the old block, spelling trouble for the residents of Albert Square. Of his casting, Fitzgerald said ""I am thrilled and honoured to be playing Nick Cotton's son and can't wait to work with John. People keep asking me what the storylines are but I am as eager as everyone to know."" Fitzgerald made his debut as Ashley on 27 July 2000.

Development
Ashley's first scene back in Albert Square saw him stealing pineapples from the fruit and veg stall, showing the character was similar to his father. In September 2000, Martyn Leek of the Sunday Mercury reported Nick Cotton would be returning to EastEnders to find his son. Nick's return scenes were filmed in Birmingham, with a BBC spokesperson saying ""We were filming in Moseley and Winson Green all week. Nick is trying to get his son Ashley back on the straight and narrow so it is a bit of a turnaround from how he used to be."" Lisa Perrott, the publicist for EastEnders said Birmingham was chosen as they needed to film scenes away from the Albert Square setting and the location suited the storyline. Ashley and Nick meet during a special spin-off episode, entitled Return of Nick Cotton, which was broadcast on 1 October 2000. Nick comes face to face with Ashley after he catches him trying to steal his car. Sue Smith of Daily Mirror said ""A chip off the old block, their reunion is bound to wreak havoc.""

In June 2001, Fitzgerald was axed from EastEnders and his character died following a motorbike accident. Fitzgerald told Ian Woodward of the Daily Mirror that he was shocked and disappointed when he learned he was being axed from the show. The actor said ""I was dumbstruck. I thought I was going to be in Albert Square for a long, long time."" Fitzgerald found filming Ashley's deaths scenes difficult and he said he thought about death a lot before they filmed his last scene. He explained ""I went over and over in my mind the whole aspect of dying. Even though I knew it was pretend time, it had a big impact on me. It freaked me out. I felt utterly drained.""

Reception
In March 2001, a major storyline saw Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) shot by unknown assailant. William Hill took bets on who shot Phil and Ashley came third with the odds of 13–2. Shortly before the character's departure, the Daily Mirror's Ian Woodward said Ashley had clearly become ""one of the more popular teenagers in EastEnders.""

History
Around 1727 the first Indian settlement was made in the Ligonier Valley, near the confluence of Mill Creek and Loyalhanna Creek. The village was still relatively new when the first traders came in 1732.

In the next quarter-century the great struggle for mid-America developed between the English and the French. The showdown came in what is now known as the French and Indian War. In 1758 the English mounted a full-scale campaign. Gen. John Forbes commanded the expedition which drove through the woods and mountains of Pennsylvania, setting up a series of forts to strengthen his hand for the final blow: the attack on Fort Duquesne at the juncture of the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers. One of the forts was named for the commander-in-chief of the British Army, Field Marshal Lord John Ligonier.

Alarmed at the approach of the British, the French and their Indian allies decided that the best defense was a good offense. On October 12, 1758, they attacked Fort Ligonier—approaching from the southwest. There were about 1,200 French soldiers and only a few hundred Indians. (Many of the Indians had returned home to prepare for the approaching winter.)

The French and Indians who attacked Fort Ligonier were under the command of DeVitri. They began firing at 11:00 am and the battle lasted until 3:00 pm After a spirited encounter, the French and Indians were beaten off with a heavy loss and they fled back to Duquesne. The British troops, under Gen. Forbes and Col. Washington, pressed on after the Ligonier victory; when they arrived at Duquesne, they found the fort afire. The victory at Ligonier was the turning point for the British. They established their own fort, named it for Prime Minister William Pitt, thus giving birth to the city of Pittsburgh.

Fort Ligonier functioned for a few more years. Arrangements were made with Gen. Arthur St. Clair of the British Army, to serve as caretaker of the facility since he lived only a short distance away. 
Increasing ferocious Indian attacks during the American Revolution led to the construction of a second fort in 1777 (sometimes known as Fort Preservation). It was located somewhat east of the original fort and served as a refuge for the settlers. By the end of the Revolution, it had outlived its usefulness and was allowed to fall into disrepair. A few years later it disappeared altogether.

Landforms of Westmoreland County, PennsylvaniaIn logic, a pseudoelementary class is a class of structures derived from an elementary class (one definable in first-order logic) by omitting some of its sorts and relations.  It is the mathematical logic counterpart of the notion in category theory of (the codomain of) a forgetful functor, and in physics of (hypothesized) hidden variable theories purporting to explain quantum mechanics.  Elementary classes are (vacuously) pseudoelementary but the converse is not always true; nevertheless pseudoelementary classes share some of the properties of elementary classes such as being closed under ultraproducts.

Definition
A pseudoelementary class is a reduct of an elementary class.  That is, it is obtained by omitting some of the sorts and relations of a (many-sorted) elementary class.

Examples
The theory with equality of sets under union and intersection, whose structures are of the form (W, ∪, ∩), can be understood naively as the pseudoelementary class formed from the two-sorted elementary class of structures of the form (A, W, ∪, ∩, ∈) where ∈ ⊆ A×W and ∪ and ∩ are binary operations (qua ternary relations) on W.  The theory of the latter class is axiomatized by
∀X,Y∈W.∀a∈A.[ a ∈ X∪Y   ⇔   a ∈ X ∨ a ∈ Y]
∀X,Y∈W.∀a∈A.[ a ∈ X∩Y   ⇔   a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y]
∀X,Y∈W.[ (∀a∈A.[a ∈ X   ⇔   a ∈ Y]) → X = Y]

In the intended interpretation A is a set of atoms a,b,..., W is a set of sets of atoms X,Y,... and ∈ is the membership relation between atoms and sets.  The consequences of these axioms include all the laws of distributive lattices.  Since the latter laws make no mention of atoms they remain meaningful for the structures obtained from the models of the above theory by omitting the sort A of atoms and the membership relation ∈.  All distributive lattices are representable as sets of sets under union and intersection, whence this pseudoelementary class is in fact an elementary class, namely the variety of distributive lattices.

In this example both classes (respectively before and after the omission) are finitely axiomatizable elementary classes.  But whereas the standard approach to axiomatizing the latter class uses nine equations to axiomatize a distributive lattice, the former class only requires the three axioms above, making it faster to define the latter class as a reduct of the former than directly in the usual way.

The theory with equality of binary relations under union R∪S, intersection R∩S, complement R−, relational composition R;S, and relational converse R, whose structures are of the form (W, ∪, ∩, −, ;, ), can be understood as the pseudoelementary class formed from the three-sorted elementary class of structures of the form (A, P, W, ∪, ∩, −, ;, , λ, ρ, π, ∈).  The intended interpretation of the three sorts are atoms, pairs of atoms, and sets of pairs of atoms, π: A×;A → P and λ,ρ: P → A are the evident pairing constructors and destructors, and ∈ ⊆ P×;W is the membership relation between pairs and relations (as sets of pairs).  By analogy with Example 1, the purely relational connectives defined on W can be axiomatized naively in terms of atoms and pairs of atoms in the customary manner of introductory texts.  The pure theory of binary relations can then be obtained as the theory of the pseudoelementary class of reducts of models of this elementary class obtained by omitting the atom and pair sorts and all relations involving the omitted sorts.

In this example both classes are elementary, but only the former class is finitely axiomatizable, though the latter class (the reduct) was shown by Tarski in 1955 to be nevertheless a variety, namely RRA, the representable relation algebras.

A primitive ring is a generalization of the notion of simple ring.  It is definable in elementary (first-order) language in terms of the elements and ideals of a ring, giving rise to an elementary class of two-sorted structures comprising rings and ideals.  The class of primitive rings is obtained from this elementary class by omitting the sorts and language associated with the ideals, and is hence a pseudoelementary class.

In this example it is an open question whether this pseudoelementary class is elementary.

The class of exponentially closed fields is a pseudoelementary class that is not elementary.

Applications
A quasivariety defined logically as the class of models of a universal Horn theory can equivalently be defined algebraically as a class of structures closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, and reduced products.  Since the notion of reduced product is more intricate than that of direct product, it is sometimes useful to blend the logical and algebraic characterizations in terms of pseudoelementary classes.  One such blended definition characterizes a quasivariety as a pseudoelementary class closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, and direct products (the pseudoelementary property allows ""reduced"" to be simplified to ""direct"").

A corollary of this characterization is that one can (nonconstructively) prove the existence of a universal Horn axiomatization of a class by first axiomatizing some expansion of the structure with auxiliary sorts and relations and then showing that the pseudoelementary class obtained by dropping the auxiliary constructs is closed under subalgebras and direct products.  This technique works for Example 2 because subalgebras and direct products of algebras of binary relations are themselves algebras of binary relations, showing that the class RRA of representable relation algebras is a quasivariety (and a fortiori an elementary class).  This short proof is an effective application of abstract nonsense; the stronger result by Tarski that RRA is in fact a variety required more honest toil.

91,393,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type1,"The pyrolysis (or devolatilization) process is the thermal decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere. It involves a change of chemical composition. The word is coined from the Greek-derived elements pyro ""fire"", ""heat"", ""fever"" and lysis ""separating"".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used in the treatment of organic materials. It is one of the processes involved in charring wood.  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves char, a carbon-rich solid residue. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly carbon as the residue, is called carbonization. Pyrolysis is considered the first step in the processes of gasification or combustion.

The process is used heavily in the chemical industry, for example, to produce ethylene, many forms of carbon, and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce coke from coal. It is used also in the conversion of natural gas (primarily methane) into non-polluting hydrogen gas and non-polluting solid carbon char, recently on an industrial scale. Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert biomass into syngas and biochar, waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

Terminology
Pyrolysis is one of the various types of chemical degradation processes that occur at higher temperatures (above the boiling point of water or other solvents). It differs from other processes like combustion and hydrolysis in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as oxygen (O2, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis). Pyrolysis produces solids (char), condensable liquids (tar), and uncondensing/permanent gasses.

Types of pyrolysis
Complete pyrolysis of organic matter usually leaves a solid residue that consists mostly of elemental carbon; the process is then called carbonization.  More specific cases of pyrolysis include: 
 methane pyrolysis, in the presence of catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to non-polluting hydrogen fuel and separable solid carbon
 hydrous pyrolysis, in the presence of superheated water or steam, producing hydrogen and also substantial atmospheric carbon dioxide, also used in oil refining
 dry distillation, as in the original production of sulfuric acid from sulfates
 destructive distillation, as in the manufacture of charcoal, coke and activated carbon
 caramelization of sugars
 high-temperature cooking processes such as roasting, frying, toasting, and grilling
 charcoal burning, the production of charcoal
 tar production by pyrolysis of wood in tar kilns
 cracking of heavier hydrocarbons into lighter ones, as in oil refining
 thermal depolymerization, that breaks down plastics and other polymers into monomers and oligomers
 ceramization involving the formation of polymer derived ceramics from preceramic polymers under an inert atmosphere
 catagenesis, the natural conversion of buried organic matter to fossil fuels and
 flash vacuum pyrolysis, used in organic synthesis.

General processes and mechanisms 

Pyrolysis generally consists in heating the material above its decomposition temperature, breaking chemical bonds in its molecules.  The fragments usually become smaller molecules, but may combine to produce residues with larger molecular mass, even amorphous covalent solids.

In many settings, some amounts of oxygen, water, or other substances may be present, so that combustion, hydrolysis, or other chemical processes may occur besides pyrolysis proper.  Sometimes those chemicals are added intentionally, as in the burning of firewood, in the traditional manufacture of charcoal, and in the steam cracking of crude oil.

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to avoid chemical side reactions (such as combustion or hydrolysis).  Pyrolysis in a vacuum also lowers the boiling point of the byproducts, improving their recovery.

When organic matter is heated at increasing temperatures in open containers, the following processes generally occur, in successive or overlapping stages:

 Below about 100 °C, volatiles, including some water, evaporate. Heat-sensitive substances, such as vitamin C and proteins, may partially change or decompose already at this stage. 
 At about 100 °C or slightly higher, any remaining water that is merely absorbed in the material is driven off. This process consumes a lot of energy, so the temperature may stop rising until all water has evaporated. Water trapped in crystal structure of hydrates may come off at somewhat higher temperatures. 
 Some solid substances, like fats, waxes, and sugars, may melt and separate.
 Between 100 and 500 °C, many common organic molecules break down. Most sugars start decomposing at 160–180 °C. Cellulose, a major component of wood, paper, and cotton fabrics, decomposes at about 350 °C. Lignin, another major wood component, starts decomposing at about 350 °C, but continues releasing volatile products up to 500 °C. The decomposition products usually include water, carbon monoxide  and/or carbon dioxide , as well as a large number of organic compounds.  Gases and volatile products leave the sample, and some of them may condense again as smoke. Generally, this process also absorbs energy. Some volatiles may ignite and burn, creating a visible flame. The non-volatile residues typically become richer in carbon and form large disordered molecules, with colors ranging between brown and black. At this point the matter is said to have been ""charred"" or ""carbonized"".
 At 200–300 °C, if oxygen has not been excluded, the carbonaceous residue may start to burn, in a highly exothermic reaction, often with no or little visible flame.  Once carbon combustion starts, the temperature rises spontaneously, turning the residue into a glowing ember and releasing carbon dioxide and/or monoxide. At this stage, some of the nitrogen still remaining in the residue may be oxidized into nitrogen oxides like  and . Sulfur and other elements like chlorine and arsenic may be oxidized and volatilized at this stage.
 Once combustion of the carbonaceous residue is complete, a powdery or solid mineral residue (ash) is often left behind, consisting of inorganic oxidized materials of high melting point. Some of the ash may have left during combustion, entrained by the gases as fly ash or particulate emissions.  Metals present in the original matter usually remain in the ash as oxides or carbonates, such as potash. Phosphorus, from materials such as bone, phospholipids, and nucleic acids, usually remains as phosphates.

Occurrence and uses

Cooking

Pyrolysis has many applications in food preparation. Caramelization is the pyrolysis of sugars in food (often after the sugars have been produced by the breakdown of polysaccharides). The food goes brown and changes flavor. The distinctive flavors are used in many dishes; for instance, caramelized onion is used in French onion soup. The temperatures needed for caramelization lie above the boiling point of water. Frying oil can easily rise above the boiling point. Putting a lid on the frying pan keeps the water in, and some of it re-condenses, keeping the temperature too cool to brown for longer time.

Pyrolysis of food can also be undesirable, as in the charring of burnt food (at temperatures too low for the oxidative combustion of carbon to produce flames and burn the food to ash).

Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars 

Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures. Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

Charcoal is a less smoky fuel than pyrolyzed wood. Some cities ban, or used to ban, wood fires; when residents only use charcoal (and similarly-treated rock coal, called coke) air pollution is significantly reduced. In cities where people do not generally cook or heat with fires, this is not needed. In the mid-20th century, ""smokeless"" legislation in Europe required cleaner-burning techniques, such as coke fuel and smoke-burning incinerators as an effective measure to reduce air pollution

The coke-making or ""coking"" process consists of heating the material in ""coking ovens"" to very high temperatures (up to ) so that the molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight. High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert coal into coke. This is useful in metallurgy, where the higher temperatures are necessary for many processes, such as steelmaking. Volatile by-products of this process are also often useful, including benzene and pyridine.  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.

The original vascular structure of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as nutshells or peach stones, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called activated carbon, which is used as an adsorbent for a wide range of chemical substances.

Biochar is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  It is a key component of the terra preta soils associated with ancient indigenous communities of the Amazon basin. Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota, compared to the typical red soil of the region. Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through biochar, the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

Carbon fibers are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable polymer, and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from ).  The first carbon fibers were made from rayon, but polyacrylonitrile has become the most common starting material. For their first workable electric lamps, Joseph Wilson Swan and Thomas Edison used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of cotton yarns and bamboo splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of pyrolytic carbon. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to . Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including artificial heart valves.

Liquid and gaseous biofuels 

Pyrolysis is the basis of several methods for producing fuel from biomass, i.e. lignocellulosic biomass. Crops studied as biomass feedstock for pyrolysis include native North American prairie grasses such as switchgrass and bred versions of other grasses such as Miscantheus giganteus. Other sources of organic matter as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, leaves, vegetables, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls, and orange peels. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge, distillers grain, and sewage sludge.

In the biomass components, the pyrolysis of hemicellulose happens between 210 and 310 °C. The pyrolysis of cellulose starts from 300–315 °C and ends at 360–380 °C, with a peak at 342–354 °C. Lignin starts to decompose at about 200 °C and continues until 1000 °C.

Synthetic diesel fuel by pyrolysis of organic materials is not yet economically competitive.  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by flash pyrolysis, in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between  for less than two seconds.

Syngas is usually produced by pyrolysis.

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes, which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change.

There is also the possibility of integrating with other processes such as mechanical biological treatment and anaerobic digestion.  Fast pyrolysis is also investigated for biomass conversion.  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by hydrous pyrolysis.

Methane pyrolysis for hydrogen

Methane pyrolysis is a non-polluting industrial process for ""turquoise"" hydrogen production from methane by removing solid carbon from natural gas. This one-step process produces non-polluting hydrogen in high volume at low cost (less than steam reforming with carbon sequestration). Only water is released when hydrogen is used as the fuel for fuel-cell electric heavy truck transportation, gas turbine electric power generation, and hydrogen for industrial processes including producing ammonia fertilizer and cement. Methane pyrolysis is the process operating around 1065 °C for producing hydrogen from natural gas that allows removal of carbon easily (solid non-polluting carbon is a byproduct of the process). The industrial quality solid carbon can then be sold or landfilled and is not released into the atmosphere, avoiding emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) or ground water pollution from a landfill. In 2015, a company called Monolith Materials built a pilot plant in Redwood City, CA to study scaling Methane Pyrolysis using renewable power in the process.  A successful pilot project then led to a larger commercial scale demonstration plant in Hallam, Nebraska in 2016.  As of 2020, this plant is operational and can produce around 14 metric tons of hydrogen per day.  In 2021, the US Department of Energy backed Monolith Materials’ plans for major expansion with a $1B loan guarantee.  The funding will help produce a plant capable of generating 164 metric tons of hydrogen per day by 2024. Volume production is also being evaluated in the BASF ""methane pyrolysis at scale"" pilot plant, the chemical engineering team at University of California - Santa Barbara and in such research laboratories as Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA). Power for process heat consumed is only one seventh of the power consumed in the water electrolysis method for producing hydrogen.

Ethylene
Pyrolysis is used to produce ethylene, the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (>110 million tons/year in 2005). In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around  in the presence of steam; this is called steam cracking. The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze (ethylene glycol), PVC (via vinyl chloride), and many other polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

Semiconductors 

The process of metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials. The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
SiH4  →  Si  +  2 H2. 
Gallium arsenide, another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of trimethylgallium and arsine.

Waste management

Pyrolysis can also be used to treat municipal solid waste and plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste. In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.

In tire waste management, tire pyrolysis is a well-developed technology.
Other products from car tire pyrolysis include steel wires, carbon black and bitumen. The area faces legislative, economic, and marketing obstacles. Oil derived from tire rubber pyrolysis has a high sulfur content, which gives it high potential as a pollutant and should be desulfurized.

Alkaline pyrolysis of sewage sludge at low temperature of 500 °C can enhance H2 production with in-situ carbon capture. The use of NaOH has the potential to produce H2-rich gas that can be used for fuels cells directly.

In early November 2021, the U.S. State of Georgia announced a joint effort with Igneo Technologies to build an $85 million large electronics recycling plant in the Port of Savannah. The project will focus on lower-value, plastics-heavy devices in the waste stream using multiple shredders and furnaces using pyrolysis technology.

Thermal cleaning 

Pyrolysis is also used for thermal cleaning, an industrial application to remove organic substances such as polymers, plastics and coatings from parts, products or production components like extruder screws, spinnerets and static mixers. During the thermal cleaning process, at temperatures between 310 C° to 540 C° (600 °F to 1000 °F), organic material is converted by pyrolysis and oxidation into volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons and carbonized gas. Inorganic elements remain.

Several types of thermal cleaning systems use pyrolysis:
 Molten Salt Baths belong to the oldest thermal cleaning systems; cleaning with a molten salt bath is very fast but implies the risk of dangerous splatters, or other potential hazards connected with the use of salt baths, like explosions or highly toxic hydrogen cyanide gas.
 Fluidized Bed Systems use sand or aluminium oxide as heating medium; these systems also clean very fast but the medium does not melt or boil, nor emit any vapors or odors; the cleaning process takes one to two hours.
 Vacuum Ovens use pyrolysis in a vacuum avoiding uncontrolled combustion inside the cleaning chamber; the cleaning process takes 8 to 30 hours.
 Burn-Off Ovens, also known as Heat-Cleaning Ovens, are gas-fired and used in the painting, coatings, electric motors and plastics industries for removing organics from heavy and large metal parts.

Fine chemical synthesis
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of diborane (B2H6) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  pentaborane and decaborane. These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H2), but also recondensation.

The synthesis of nanoparticles, zirconia and oxides utilizing an ultrasonic nozzle in a process called ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP).

Other uses and occurrences
 Pyrolysis is used to turn organic materials into carbon for the purpose of carbon-14 dating.
 Pyrolysis of tobacco, paper, and additives, in cigarettes and other products, generates many volatile products (including nicotine, carbon monoxide, and tar) that are responsible for the aroma and negative health effects of smoking.  Similar considerations apply to the smoking of marijuana and the burning of incense products and mosquito coils.
 Pyrolysis occurs during the incineration of trash, potentially generating volatiles that are toxic or contribute to air pollution if not completely burned.
 Laboratory or industrial equipment sometimes gets fouled by carbonaceous residues that result from coking, the pyrolysis of organic products that come into contact with hot surfaces.

PAHs generation 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be generated from the pyrolysis of different solid waste fractions, such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, pectin, starch, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PS, PVC, and lignin generate significant amount of PAHs. Naphthalene is the most abundant PAH among all the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

When the temperature is increased from 500 to 900 °C, most PAHs increase. With increasing temperature, the percentage of light PAHs decreases and the percentage of heavy PAHs increases.

Study tools

Thermogravimetric analysis 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is one of the most common techniques to investigate pyrolysis with no limitations of heat and mass transfer. The results can be used to determine mass loss kinetics. Activation energies can be calculated using the Kissinger method or peak analysis-least square method (PA-LSM).

TGA can couple with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry. As the temperature increases, the volatiles generated from pyrolysis can be measured.

Macro-TGA 
In TGA, the sample is loaded first before the increase of temperature, and the heating rate is low (less than 100 °C min−1). Macro-TGA can use gram-scale samples, which can be used to investigate the pyrolysis with mass and heat transfer effects.

Pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry 
Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) is an important laboratory procedure to determine the structure of compounds.

History

Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into charcoal since ancient times. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood. The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th century.

Pyrolysis was instrumental in the discovery of many important chemical substances, such as phosphorus (from ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate  in concentrated urine) and oxygen (from mercuric oxide and various nitrates).

Where the conduct alleged in the summons or complaint is an infraction or summary offence, failure to appear is a process crime of common law for which a bench-warrant can be issued if the defendant promised to appear for release or if it happens to be the sentencing. If the conduct alleged is a tort or other cause for civil action, failure to appear generally results in a default judgment by the court in favor of the plaintiff/petitioner.

In the United States
Failure to appear in U.S. federal law is an offense, depending on the seriousness of the offense the person is being sentenced for:

A witness allowed for release is, in the result, treated the same as though for a misdemeanor.

All states except for Maryland, Mississippi and Wyoming have similar state laws. The territories of the United States lack the crime. In Minnesota, the punishment for failure to appear can even exceed the punishment foreseen by the law for the underlying offense. In most jurisdictions a crime based on another's legal importance, different from qualifications, as for example threatening with bodily violence, never exceeds the punishment of the basic crime, which in the example was bodily violence.

Civil law
In civil law, there is regularly no crime of failure to appear at the criminal court. However, an arrest warrant may be issued and resisting it may fulfill obstruction of a police officer in the exercise of his duties.

Criticism
The criminal status of so-called bail jumping has been criticized as unreasonable due to daily-life and not unusual impedications to attending trial like childcare and transport problems. Punishability for missing the trial because of hospitalization has been seen as injustice. Less supportably than for other crimes, it keeps criminals shut in the punitive system and, more particularly, its institutions. In case of determining bail, it exacerbates the placement on bail significantly.

C., a couple of years after the events in The Run. The novel continues the story of the Lee family of Delano, Georgia. It is also the first appearance of recurring villain Teddy Faye.

Plot summary
In Capital Crimes, Will Lee finds himself in the middle of a tangled web of intrigue and danger, politics and power. Now at the pinnacle of his career, serving as president of the United States, Lee is faced with a most unusual task-that of marshaling federal law enforcement agencies to catch an assassin who is picking off some of the nation's high-level politicos. When a prominent conservative politician with a shady reputation is expertly killed at his lakeside cabin, authorities can come up with no suspects and even less hard evidence. But then, within days, two other, seemingly isolated deaths-achieved by very different means-are feared linked to the same ruthless murderer. With the help of his CIA director wife, Kate Rule Lee, Will trails the most clever and professional of killers before he can strike again. From a quiet D.C. suburb to the corridors of power to a deserted island hideaway, Will, Kate, and maverick FBI agent Robert Kinney track their man and set a trap with extreme caution and care-and await the most dangerous kind of quarry, a killer with a cause to die for.

90,397,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type5,"4, also known as Foreigner 4, is the fourth studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on July 2, 1981, on Atlantic Records. Several singles from the album were hits, including ""Urgent"", ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" and ""Juke Box Hero"".

The album was a success worldwide, holding the #1 position on the Billboard album chart for a total of 10 weeks.  It eventually sold over six million copies in the US alone.

Background and writing
The album was originally titled Silent Partners and later was changed to 4, reflecting both the fact that it was Foreigner's fourth album and that the band was now down to four members. In 1981, art studio Hipgnosis was asked to design a cover based on the original title, and they developed a black and white image of a young man in bed with a pair of binoculars suspended in the air overhead. The resulting design was rejected by the band as they felt it was ""too homosexual"". The replacement cover for 4 was designed by Bob Defrin and modeled after an old fashioned film leader. Hipgnosis is still credited with designing the record labels.

The album marked the completion of the band's shift from hard rock to a more mainstream, pop outfit which had begun in Head Games. Both Ian McDonald and Al Greenwood had left before the recording of 4. As a result, all of the songs on the album are compositions by Mick Jones and/or Lou Gramm. McDonald and Greenwood had played saxophone and keyboards, respectively, and so several session musicians were needed to replace their contributions, among them Junior Walker, who played the saxophone solo in the bridge of ""Urgent"", and a young Thomas Dolby, who would later have a successful solo career.

Ultimate Classic Rock critic Matt Wardlaw rated four of the songs from 4 - ""Juke Box Hero,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""Urgent"" and ""Night Life"" among  Foreigner's top 10 songs.  Ultimate Classic Rock critic Eduardo Rivadavia rated two of the songs from 4 - ""Girl on the Moon"" and ""Woman in Black"" among  Foreigner's 10 most underrated songs.

The game rules are specified with S-expressions, Zillions rule language. It was designed to handle mostly abstract strategy board games or puzzles. After parsing the rules of the game, the system's artificial intelligence can automatically play one or more players. It treats puzzles as solitaire games and its AI can be used to solve them.

Scripting language
The scripting language of Zillions-of-Games uses S-expressions. The rules are stored in a text file with extension "".zrf"" (zillions rules file). The users can create their own ZRF-files and make the AI of Zillions-of-Games play their newly created game.

The result of loading of this ZRF into Zillions-of-Games and playing against the computer is shown in screenshot at right.

The definition of games usually contains the following pattern:
 Game title. One ZRF can contain more than one game and game title allows the user to select a certain game.
 Description, history and strategy of the game. This is a text which shown to the user on demand to explain game rules, history and to give general gameplay advice.
 Players.  This is a list of player names used in the game. For example, for chess it would be White, Black.  The player name is used in some further places, for example in initial position or game goal definitions.  There could be just one player (e.g. for puzzles), two or more.
 Turn order This specifies the order of moves made by the players.  In the example above, the player X starts, the player O moves and then the whole sequence repeats. The definition of turn-order can be more complex, for example for balanced double-move chess it would be: (turn-order White repeat Black Black White White), which specifies the following order of moves: White, Black, Black, White, White, Black, Black, White, White, etc.

 Board definition. This sections specifies geometry of the playing board, separate positions of the board and connections between them.  The board definition in the example above first specifies a bitmap image to be used for the board. A 2-dimensional board is defined using pixel coordinates from the bitmap.  The definition (""top-/middle-/bottom-"" (0 112)) specified notations to be used for rows as well as an offset in pixels between rows. The text notation is used in move list, as well for saving the played game into "".zsg"" (zillions saved game) file.  The connections between board position is specified in (directions ...) statement.  The example above defines four directions: n (north) - one step up, e (east) - one step right, nw - diagonally up-left and ne - diagonally up-right. The directions are used in move definitions as well as in game goal definitions.
 Piece definition. Defines pieces used in the game, their names and how they moved. In the example above one pieces is defined, Man, which can be dropped on any empty position of the board. Besides this two bitmaps for X and O players are specified.
 Board setup. Specifies initial position of the game. The example above defines that the board is empty initially and each side has 5 pieces off the board, which can be dropped.
 Goal of the game. Condition when one of players wins or when draw occurs. In Tic-Tac-Toe win condition (3-in-a-row) is defined as relative piece configurations, using directions n, e, ne and nw from board definition.

Implemented games
Zillions of Games is so called because of its potential to play a very large number of user-programmed games. The system is shipped with over 300 games and puzzles. These include a lot of popular board games, such as Alquerque, Fox and geese, Go, Gomoku, Jungle, Halma, Nim,  Nine men's morris, Reversi, Tafl and Tic-tac-toe. The package includes many checkers variants, for example Russian and Turkish Checkers. Besides standard FIDE chess, Zillions of Games contains many national chess variants such as shogi, xiangqi, janggi, as well as a number of popular chess variants like Ultima, Extinction chess, Losing Chess, shatranj, Berolina chess, Grand Chess and others. It also include some puzzles, such as 15-Puzzle, Towers of Hanoi, eight queens, and a variety of Solitaires.

Not long after it came to market in late 1998, users of Zillions of Games began to program new games and puzzles for it, creating many of them themselves. Two large collections of Zillions Rules Files (ZRFs) soon began to appear. One was at the Zillions-of-Games website, and the other was at the Chess Variant Pages website. The former collected together every kind of ZRF, whereas the latter focused on ZRFs for chess variants. As of November 2017, the ZILLIONS interface had 2,577 ZRF's, created by 462 ZRF authors, and the Chess Variant Pages collection had 794 ZRF's of chess variants.

The games programmed by the users include such games as 4D Tic-Tac-Toe, FreeCell, Rubik's Cube, Teeko, Mancala, Alice Chess, Chess960, Hexagonal chess, Star Trek Tridimensional Chess and Sokoban. Besides various games and puzzles, there are also educational ZRFs, such as the cellular automata Game of Life, a calculator, and some Turing machine simulations.

Uses
Zillions of Games can be used for the following:

Playing any of the games or puzzles that come with it.
Playing any of the free games and puzzles that have been programmed for it by users.
Playing games with remote users through the internet or a dialup connection.
Playing games by emailing ZSG files back and forth.
Programming it to play new games and puzzles.
Using it as a development tool for the creation of new games and puzzles.
Testing new games for drawishness and other qualities by having Zillions play them against itself.
Solving puzzles or making sure that newly created puzzles can be solved.
Creating diagrams that can be cut out of screen captures.

Capabilities

Zillions represents boards and pieces with bitmap images; these can be remapped by the user. The boards may be arbitrary directed graphs, but standard grid-like boards are easier to produce and have built-in support for detecting collinearity. The available win, loss, and draw conditions include checkmate, stalemate, repetition, piece capture, absolute configuration, relative configuration, and various types of piece count. These allow the creation of a variety of different games and puzzles.

Besides defining how pieces move, Zillions can define how pieces may be dropped. This is for introducing new pieces into a game. It is not useful for shogi, which ""drops"" captured pieces stored on the sides of the board. It is for games like Go, Reversi, and Tic-Tac-Toe, which routinely allow users to add new pieces to the board. As with piece movement, this is defined algorithmically, and it can be something as simple as letting a new piece drop only on an empty space or follow more complex rules.

Since version 2.0, Zillions has had the additional ability to enforce maximal capturing rules (used in some versions of Checkers) and a full-featured Go-playing engine.

Zillions includes a ""random player"" which selects from its available moves at random; this can be used to simulate dice in race games and Backgammon relatives.

The standard AI engine can, if need be, be replaced with user-created engines. These engines can then use opening books or other features unavailable to the standard AI.

Limitations

Despite its versatility, Zillions of Games has a number of non-trivial limitations:
 Zillions Of Games is designed to play perfect information games exclusively.  This renders it of little or no use in fairly playing imperfect or hidden information games against the AI, such as card games or board games with hidden piece values like Stratego.  Instead, the program will automatically use all information available to itself, including the cards in the deck and the cards in the hands of all other players. The games may still be played by human players, although there is no support for revealing information selectively to only one player.
 Its programming language lacks support for arithmetic, for functions, and for variables beyond some boolean flags.
 The engine does not have built-in support for connection-based goals such as in Hex; thus these goals must be implemented by hand.
 There is also no support for having multiple pieces per location, or for pieces covering multiple locations at once. Thus, complicated workarounds are required for games that need these features, such as Mancala, Laska or Quoridor.
 Like most AI game playing programs, the default engine plays poorly in games with large branching factors, such as shogi.
 In some vital respects, the program is too restrictive in what it allows.
 Although it can recognize repetition, the only kind it can recognize is threefold repetition.
 Although it can check for various win, loss and draw conditions at the end of a move, it cannot check for any of them when evaluating possible moves for a piece.  Consequently, in shogi, for example, it cannot be programmed to always accurately enforce the rule against checkmating a King with a Pawn drop.
 Many multi-person chess variants cannot be played because it will immediately stop the game when the first player is checkmated or stalemated.
 In some cases, the quality of gameplay is compromised due to the AI automatically calculating piece values inaccurately with no option available for manually overriding it with accurate piece values.
Many of these limitations can be bypassed using extensions such as Axiom Development Kit.

Video game development softwareIn Eastern Orthodox Christian theology, the Tabor Light ( ""Light of Tabor"", or  ""Uncreated Light"",  ""Divine Light"";  ""Taboric Light""; Georgian: თაბორის ნათება) is the light revealed on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration of Jesus, identified with the light seen by Paul at his conversion.

As a theological doctrine, the uncreated nature of the Light of Tabor was formulated in the 14th century by Gregory Palamas, an Athonite monk, defending the mystical practices of Hesychasm against accusations of heresy by Barlaam of Calabria. When considered as a theological doctrine, this view is known as Palamism after Palamas.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1291594 John Meyendorff, ""Mount Athos in the Fourteenth Century: Spiritual and Intellectual Legacy"" in Dumbarton Oaks Papers 1988]</ref>

The view was very controversial when it was first proposed, sparking the Hesychast controversy, and the Palamist faction prevailed only after the military victory of John VI Kantakouzenos in the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347. Since 1347, it has been the official doctrine in Eastern Orthodoxy, while it remains without explicit affirmation or denial by the Roman Catholic Church. 
Roman Catholic theologians have rejected it in the past, but the Catholic view has tended be more favourable since the later 20th century. Several Western scholars have presented Palamism as compatible with Catholic doctrine.
In particular, Pope John Paul II in 1996 spoke favourably of hesychast spirituality,Original text (in Italian)
Speaking of the hesychast controversy, Pope John Paul II said the term ""hesychasm"" refers to a practice of prayer marked by deep tranquillity of the spirit intent on contemplating God unceasingly by invoking the name of Jesus. While from a Catholic viewpoint there have been tensions concerning some developments of the practice, the Pope said, there is no denying the goodness of the intention that inspired its defence, which was to stress that man is offered the concrete possibility of uniting himself in his inner heart with God in that profound union of grace known as Theosis, divinization. and in 2002 he named the Transfiguration as the fourth Luminous Mystery of the Holy Rosary.

In Eastern Orthodoxy
According to the Hesychast mystic tradition of Eastern Orthodox spirituality, a completely purified saint who has attained divine union experiences the vision of divine radiance that is the same 'light' that was manifested to Jesus' disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. This experience is referred to as theoria. Barlaam (and Western Christianity's interpretation of apophaticism being the absence of God rather than the unknowability of God) held this view of the hesychasts to be polytheistic inasmuch as it seemed to postulate two eternal substances, a visible (the divine energies) and an invisible (the divine ousia or essence).
Seco and Maspero assert that the Palamite doctrine of the uncreated light is rooted in Palamas' reading of Gregory of Nyssa.

Instances of the Uncreated Light are read into the Old Testament by Orthodox Christians, e.g. the Burning Bush a purported descendant of which is kept at the Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai in the Sinai Peninsula.

Hesychast controversy

Gregory Palamas defended Hesychasm in the 1340s at three different synods in Constantinople, and he also wrote a number of works in its defense. In these works,  Gregory Palamas uses a distinction, already found in the 4th century in the works of the Cappadocian Fathers, between the energies or operations (Gr. energeiai) of God and the essence (ousia) of God. Gregory taught that the energies or operations of God were uncreated. He taught that the essence of God can never be known by his creatures even in the next life, but that his uncreated energies or operations can be known both in this life and in the next, and can convey to the Hesychast in this life and to the righteous in the next life as a true spiritual knowledge of God (theoria). In Palamite theology, it is the uncreated energies of God that illumine the Hesychast who has been vouchsafed an experience of the Uncreated Light.

In 1341 the dispute came before a synod held at Constantinople and presided over by the Emperor Andronicus III Palaeologus; the synod, taking into account the regard in which the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius were held, condemned Barlaam, who recanted and returned to Calabria, afterwards becoming bishop in the Roman Catholic Church.

One of Barlaam's friends, Gregory Akindynos, who originally was also a friend of Gregory's, took up the controversy, and three other synods on the subject were held, at the second of which the followers of Barlaam gained a brief victory. However, in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor John VI Cantacuzenus, Hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Identification with the fires of hell
Many Orthodox theologians have identified the Tabor light with the fire of hell. According to these theologians, hell is the condition of those who remain unreconciled to the uncreated light and love of and for God and are burned by it.PARADISE AND HELL IN THE ORTHODOX TRADITION by Fr. George Mmetallinos, Orthodox Heritage, Vol. 07, Issue 03-04
March–April 2009. According to Iōannēs Polemēs, Theophanes of Nicea believed that, for sinners, ""the divine light will be perceived as the punishing fire of hell"".

According to Iōannēs Polemēs, Palamas himself did not identify hell-fire with the Tabor light: ""Unlike Theophanes, Palamas did not believe that sinners could have an experience of the divine light [...] Nowhere in his works does Palamas seem to adopt Theophanes' view that the light of Tabor is identical with the fire of hell.""

Roman Catholicism

Palamism, Gregory Palamas' theology of divine ""operations"", was never accepted by the Scholastic theologians of the Latin Catholic Church, who maintained a strong view of the simplicity of God, conceived as Actus purus.
This doctrinal division reinforced the east–west split of the Great Schism throughout the 15th to 19th centuries, with only Pope John Paul II opening a possibility for reconciliation by expressing his personal respect for the doctrine.

Catholicism traditionally sees the glory manifested at Tabor as symbolic of the eschatological glory of heaven; in a 15th-century Latin hymn Coelestis formam gloriae (Sarum Breviary, Venice, 1495; trans. Rev. John M. Neale 1851):
O wondrous type, O vision fair / of glory that the Church shall share / Which Christ upon the mountain shows / where brighter than the sun He glows / With shining face and bright array / Christ deigns to manifest today / What glory shall be theirs above / who joy in God with perfect love.

Pope Saint Gregory the Great wrote of people by whom, ""while still living in this corruptible flesh, yet growing in incalculable power by a certain piercingness of contemplation, the Eternal Brightness is able to be seen."" In his poem The Book of the Twelve Béguines, John of Ruysbroeck, a 14th-century Flemish mystic beatified by Pope Pius X in 1908, wrote of ""the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'"" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.

Roman Catholic pro-ecumenism under John Paul II from the 1980s 
sought for common ground in questions of doctrinal division between the Eastern and the Western Church. 
John Paul II repeatedly emphasized his respect for Eastern theology as an enrichment for the whole Church, and spoke favourably of Hesychasm. In 2002, he also named the Transfiguration as the fourth Luminous Mystery of the Holy Rosary. The Eastern doctrine of ""uncreated light"" has not been officially accepted in the Catholic Church, which likewise has not officially condemned it. Increasing parts of the Western Church consider Gregory Palamas a saint, even if uncanonized. ""Several Western scholars contend that the teaching of St. Gregory Palamas himself is compatible with Roman Catholic thought on the matter.""
At the same time, anti-ecumenical currents within Eastern Orthodoxy presented the Tabor Light doctrine as a major dogmatic division between the Eastern and the Western Church, with the Hesychast movement even described as ""a direct condemnation of Papism"".

Popular culture
""Tabor Light"" was also used in the popular press of 1938 in reference to a mysterious light seen around a cemetery named ""Tabor"" near Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, Canada.

89,400,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type1,"A fiscorn () is a brass instrument. It is a bass flugelhorn in the key of C. In the cobla, it has the deepest sound among the brass instruments.

Background
Originally played in polka bands throughout Germany and the former Czechoslovakia, as well as in military bands in Italy, the instrument has migrated to find its home today in Catalonia. Favored over other valved low brass for its haunting mellow tone and bell front projection, the fiscorn quickly became an essential instrument of the cobla band, along with the tenora, tible and flabiol. While the instrument has been dropped from most music ensembles for intonational concerns, the instrument's powerful baritone voice has no counterpart, (save perhaps the piston-valved marching baritone), in the organology. The forward-projected sound makes a pair of fiscorns the most suitable two instruments to join the shrill Catalan shawms (tenoras and tibles) and flabiol pipe, together with trumpets and trombone in the outdoor town-square setting where the cobla bands play for sardana dancers.

Musicians
While the instrument is often played by trombonists, its conical nature is easily mastered by tuba or euphonium players. Several instrument manufacturers have attempted to solve the intonational discrepancies of the instrument in recent years, with a varied success. The instrument is taught throughout Catalonia, most notably in the traditional music departments of the ESMUC (Catalonia College of Music) in Barcelona and at the CRR (Conservatoire à rayonnement régional) in Perpignan, France.

SardanaThe Wizard of Linn is a science fiction novel  by Canadian American writer A. E. van Vogt, a sequel to Empire of the Atom. The novel was originally serialized in the science fiction magazine Astounding Science Fiction (April - June 1950).  It was first published in book form in Germany in 1961 by Terra Sonderband, as Der Zauberer von Linn.

Plot
An alien starship has entered the solar system sometime in the Sixth Century of the Thirteenth Millennium A. D.  The ship appears to belong to the Riss, an alien race who had come to Sol millennia ago and destroyed the thriving human civilization.  Now the descendants of the survivors, living in a medieval society with spaceships, must face the threat again.  One of those is Jerrin, Lord Advisor of the Linnan Empire.  Jerrin is annoyed that his brother, the mutant atom priest Clane, knew about the Riss incursion before he did and is more annoyed when Clane recommends an attack on the Riss ship, one that is guaranteed to fail.

The attack does indeed fail, but Clane, Jerrin, and their associates are protected by a glassy-looking aetherial sphere that Clane controls mentally and that absorbs energy.  For his second attack Clane sneaks aboard the Riss ship and uses the sphere to eliminate the crew.  Taking over the ship, Clane flies it to his estate.  There he discovers that Jerrin has been assassinated, poisoned by his wife Lilidel, who was concerned that her son Calaj was to be disinherited from the Lord Advisorship.  Worse, Clane discovers that his magic sphere has been stolen by followers of Czinczar, a barbarian from Europa who recently tried to conquer the Empire of Linn.

Calaj becomes Lord Advisor and Clane convinces him to sign a document, which he does without reading it.  Lilidel is incensed: though the document appears to strengthen Calaj, she is suspicious, especially knowing that Clane has disappeared.  Then the Riss arrive.

Clane has taken part of his army along with Czinczar and his army aboard the captured Riss ship, which he has renamed Solar Star, and has headed out on a one-year journey to a star sixty-five light-years from Sol.  On arrival they discover two Earth-like planets revolving about their common center of mass as they go around their sun.  The planets are occupied by humans, but Clane and his crew are shocked to discover that those people can teleport themselves and other things at will and that they have a peaceful trading relationship with the Riss.  During the visit Clane and his crew engage and destroy a Riss battleship.  Then, using star maps retrieved from the wreckage, Clane takes the Solar Star on a three-month voyage to a Riss solar system.

Clane and his army establish a bridgehead on the Riss planet and fend off a Riss attack.  After the attack the Terrans discover humans living in vast artificial caverns and Clane discovers that they have another aetherial sphere, which he controls with his thoughts.  Taking the sphere with them, Clane and his men reboard the Solar Star and return to Earth.

Clane quickly re-establishes himself on Earth and takes over the government, using the document that Calaj so carelessly signed.  He sends Lilidel and Calaj into exile and then employs the aetherial sphere in a new way to defeat the Riss.

History

Early career
Mass of the Fermenting Dregs was formed in 2002 in Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, with the original all-female lineup of Natsuko Miyamoto, Chiemi Ishimoto and Reiko Gotoh. The name of the band was conceived by simply lining up words the members liked. Following Reiko's departure from the band in October 2007, the band toured with the official lineup of Natsuko and Chiemi, with various musicians serving as a ""support drummer"". Their breakthrough came at the 2007 ""Road to Tarbox Audition"" competition held by EMI Japan, which put the band in contact with noted American record producer Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, OK Go) of Tarbox Road Studios. With Fridmann producing, they recorded two tracks, I F A Surfer and Bears (ベアーズ), which appeared on their 2008 self-titled E.P. In 2010, support drummer Yoshino Tsutomu became an official member of the band, prior to the release of their major label debut album.

Departure of Chiemi Ishimoto
In October 2010, it was announced that the band's guitarist of six years, Chiemi Ishimoto, would be leaving the group after completing the band's national tour on December 11, 2010. Her leaving was due to a medical panic disorder. Ishimoto's last performance was held at the Shibuya Club Quattro. Guitarist and lead vocalist Eriko Hashimoto of the band Chatmonchy attended the performance, sharing the enthralling experience of the final performance of ""End Roll"" on her official blog on her band's official website.

Departure of Yoshino Tsutomu
In December 2011, Yoshino Tsutomu announced that he would be leaving the group for undisclosed reasons. This left Miyamoto as the sole founding and active member of the band.

Dissolution
Though Natsuko Miyamoto, with the help of supporting members, continued to perform as Mass of the Fermenting Dregs through the spring of 2012, on September the 1st of the same year, she officially announced that Mass of the Fermenting Dregs would cease to exist as of that day. As a parting present, Miyamoto shared the last of the works recorded while Tsutomu was still a member. A song titled ""たんたんたん"" (tantantan) was made available for download through a direct link placed within the page containing the departing letter to the fans on the official M.o.F.D. website.

Reformation (2015–present)
In December the M.o.F.D website started to update, deleting the departing letter on the website. Natsuko Miyamoto sent hints on Twitter about M.o.F.D, and the band was later confirmed to play on the New Year's Q2 Concert, thus confirming the reunion of the band. In May, 2016, the band played in three Canadian cities on the ""Next Music From Tokyo"" concert tour.

Style and influences
The band's sound is often compared to that of other influential Japanese post-hardcore acts, notably NUMBER GIRL (ナンバー・ガール). They are often associated with the alternative/progressive rock act 9mm Parabellum Bullet(キューミリ・パラベラム・バレット), with whom they toured in early 2009.
The English version of the band's website also claims western alternative rock bands Sugar (American band), The Wedding Present, and The Smashing Pumpkins as influences on their songwriting.

51,402,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type3,"Cork cambium  (pl. cambia or cambiums) is a tissue found in many vascular plants as a part of the epidermis. It is one of the many layers of bark, between the cork and primary phloem. The cork cambium is a lateral meristem and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the epidermis in roots and stems. It is found in woody and many herbaceous dicots, gymnosperms and some monocots (monocots usually lack secondary growth). It is one of the plant's meristems – the series of tissues consisting of embryonic disk (incompletely differentiated) cells from which the plant grows. The function of cork cambium is to produce the cork, a tough protective material.

Synonyms for cork cambium are bark cambium, pericambium and phellogen. Phellogen is defined as the meristematic cell layer responsible for the development of the periderm. Cells that grow inwards from there are termed phelloderm, and cells that develop outwards are termed phellem or cork (note similarity with vascular cambium). The periderm thus consists of three different layers:
 phelloderm – inside of cork cambium; composed of living parenchyma cells
 phellogen (cork cambium) – meristem that gives rise to periderm 
 phellem (cork) – dead at maturity; air-filled protective tissue on the outside

Growth and development of cork cambium is very variable between different species, and is also highly dependent on age and growth conditions, as can be observed from the different surfaces of bark, which may be smooth, fissured, tesselated, scaly, or flaking off.

Economic importance 

Commercial cork is derived from the bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). Cork has many uses including wine bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, hot pads to protect tables from hot pans, insulation, sealing for lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc. It is also a high strength-to-weight/cost ablative material for aerodynamic prototypes in wind tunnels, as well as satellite launch vehicle payload fairings, reentry surfaces, and compression joints in thrust-vectored solid rocket motor nozzles.

Many types of bark are used as mulch.

American filmsThe Englynion y Beddau () is a Middle Welsh verse catalogue listing the resting places (beddau) of legendary heroes. It consists of a series of englynion, or short stanzas in quantitative meter, and survives in a number of manuscripts. The collection is thought to be considerably older than its earliest manuscript, the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen, and provides an important early glimpse at medieval Welsh heroic tradition and topographical folklore.

Transmission
The stanzas, or more specifically, englynion, are transmitted in four classes of medieval Welsh manuscripts and later transcripts. The earliest, best known and most reliable version of the text is the collection of 73 englynion preserved in the Black Book of Carmarthen. The first 69 stanzas were copied in the first quarter of the 13th century, while the last four were added at a later stage, probably in the same century. Five further englynion survive as part of the poetic cycles of Heledd and Llywarch Hen in the Red Book of Hergest and two transcripts, supposedly from the White Book of Rhydderch, made in the decades on both sides of 1600: BL, Additional MS 31055 and Peniarth MS 111. The third significant group is represented by Dr John Davies' copy in NLW Peniarth 98(B) and a number of manuscripts which appear to go back to a 16th-century manuscript, now lost. It contains 18 stanzas in corrupt form, some of which are alternative versions of the englynion in the Black Book of Carmarthen. Finally, there is a single englyn milwr preserved in Wrexham MS 1 and still later manuscripts.

Although the earliest extant manuscript dates to the 13th century, much of the material is thought to be considerably earlier. According to Thomas Jones, the language, style and metre of the verses suggests a date of composition somewhere in the 9th or 10th century. Likewise, Jenny Rowlands has dated some of the stanzas contained in the Black Book text to the 9th century.

Form and structure
The core of the text in the Black Book of Carmarthen is made up by the englynion which employ either of two basic opening formulas. The first of these formulas is Y bedd ""The grave"" (33x), or variants thereof, such as Y beddau (6x) and (Y) tri bedd (2x). The other takes the form of a question, Pieu y bedd…? ""Whose is the grave…?"" (18x), usually followed by an answer identifying the name of the hero who lies in the grave. A further 13 stanzas deviate from this pattern and they may be regarded as additions which derive from other sources, though some are part of a series which contains one of these set formulas. In the standard edition of the work by Thomas Jones, they are given as stanzas 7 (not an englyn), 14-15 (on Owain and Cynddylan), 19 (part of 17-19, on Meigen son of Rhun), 30 (part of 28-30, on graves at a site called Gwanas), 37-38 (on Beid(d)awg Rudd), 42-43 (presumably uttered by the legendary Taliesin), 41 (on Cynddylig son of Corcnud), 47 (part of 46-7, on Eiddew and Eidal, sons of Meigen), 62 (on Bradwen) and 64.

A single englyn may describe up to three different heroes. Place-names are often absent and when described, the grave-sites may assume a variety of locations - in mountainous, hilly or flat landscapes, near waterways or churches, and even in the sea. The verses occasionally refer to the physical condition of the graves, such as wetness and growth of moss.

Themes and contents
With the exception of the four women mentioned in stanza 70, the names of the dead belong to male heroes of Welsh legend (rather than history). They receive high praise for the virile strength and prowess they have shown in battle, such as Dehewaint, a ""strong pillar of warriors"". Although the dominant tone remains one of heroic celebration, the eulogies are also touched with a hint of sadness for the inevitability of death, as expressed in the gnomic statement that ""each one's death comes at the fated time"" (stanza 64).

Like the Trioedd Ynys Prydein or Welsh Triads, the work is valuable for offering numerous glimpses of Welsh heroic tradition. These are embedded in snippets of topographic folklore, which ""[testify] to the close association between heroes and places in early Welsh literature"".

The work is famous for containing an early allusion to King Arthur, whose grave is said to be one of the mysteries of the world (anoeth byd). References or possible allusions to Bedwyr, Gwalchmai and the Battle of Camlann also testify to some absorption of Arthurian tradition in the text, though the work has little in common with the earliest Welsh Arthurian tale, Culhwch ac Olwen.

There are also references to characters known from the Middle Welsh prose tales of the Mabinogi. The Dylan of stanza 4, whose grave is said to be near the church of St Beuno (i.e. at Clynnog Fawr), appears to be the Dylan Eil Ton (""son of Wave"") who occurs in the Fourth Branch. Another Mabinogi character is Pryderi, of whom the Fourth Branch tells that he was slain and buried at Maen Tyriawg, above the Felenrhyd. Stanza 7 locates his grave at the confluence of the Gwenoli, which is where the stream meets the Felenrhyd. The relation between the grave of Lleu Llaw Gyffes ""under cover of the sea, / where his disgrace was, / a man who spared no one"" (stanza 35) and the account of his death in the Fourth Branch is uncertain and it may be that the englyn alludes to a somewhat different story.

androst-4-ene-3,17-dione + AH2 + O2  3-oxo-13,17-secoandrost-4-ene-17,13alpha-lactone + A + H2O

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 3-oxo-13,17-secoandrost-4-ene-17,13alpha-lactone, the reduction product A, and H2O.

This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is androst-4-ene-3,17-dione-hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidorcockeductase (13-hydroxylating, lactonizing). Other names in common use include androstene-3,17-dione hydroxylase, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione 17-oxidoreductase, androst-4-ene-3,17-dione hydroxylase, androstenedione monooxygenase, and 4-androstene-3,17-dione monooxygenase.  This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism.

Etymology
The name ""Innerleithen"" comes from the Scottish Gaelic meaning ""confluence of the Leithen"", because it is here that the river joins the Tweed. The prefix ""Inner-/Inver-"" (Inbhir-) is common in many Scottish placenames, such as Inverness and Inverurie. At this confluence, the Tweed flows approximately west-east, and the Leithen Water flows from the north.

Layout
The layout of the town is dominated by the surrounding hills. To the north the peaked hill of Lee Pen (502m), and its southerly spur Caerlee Hill (258m). To the east the rounded hill of Pirn Craig (363m) - locally known as ""Rocky"" - and its townward spur of Windy Knowe (155m), also known as ""Pirn Hill"", and to the south, beyond the Tweed, the extended of ridge of Plora Craig rises sharply from the southerly bank. Thus the town has grown in an inverted 'T' shape north up the valley of the Leithen and east-west along north bank flood plain of the Tweed.

History
The area occupied by the town has been inhabited since pre-Roman times. The remains of an Iron-Age hill fort are visible atop Caerlee Hill, in the form of defensive ditchworks. Ditchworks are also visible on the hill of Windy Knowe and, whilst there is some local speculation that these belong to an unusual round Roman hill fort, they are in fact typical of an indigenous Iron Age hill fort. Crop marks from aerial photographs of the 1950s suggest the existence of a semi-permanent Roman marching camp on the flood plain by the river Tweed at Toll Wood (near Traquair) and at nearby Eshiels.

The town is said to have been founded by an itinerant pilgrim monk called St. Ronan in A.D.737, who came to Innerleithen via the River Tweed in a coracle. Monks would certainly have travelled the natural route of the Clyde and Tweed valleys on their way between the religious centres of Iona and Holy Island. A Celtic stone carved with cup and rings/channels, known as the Runic Cross (although there are neither runes on it, nor any evidence that it was a cross shaft) was found on the slopes of the Leithen valley suggesting that a church existed during the Early Middle Ages. The stone can be viewed in the courtyard of the parish church on Leithen Road.

In the local legend of the town's founding ""St. Ronan Cleik't the Deil by the hind leg and banished him"", possibly a metaphor for the monks bringing Christian learning back into these regions.

The legend was actually formalised by Sir Walter Scott and was later instigated in a town festival called ""The Cleikum Ceremonies"" in 1901. This was seen as a way to prevent the legends and folktales of the region from dying out. Scott wrote about the town in his 1824 novel St. Ronan's Well.

The Ceremonies continue to this day as part of St. Ronans Borders Games, also known as 'Games Week' (although, in reality, this is a 10-day-long festival). The Border Games date from 1827 and are the oldest organised sports meeting in Scotland. These happen in the first and second week in July and draw significant local and tourist participation.

Accounts of Innerleithen date from the 12th century, when it was recorded as ""Inverlethane"". It is said that a son of King Malcolm IV of Scotland (who was staying at Traquair House on a hunting trip), drowned accidentally in a deep pool at the confluence of the rivers Leithen and Tweed. The body was recovered by locals and taken to the church, in recognition of which the King bestowed the right of sanctuary to the land. The pool where the drowning is alleged to have taken place is still known locally as ""The Droont Pool"". However, it should be borne in mind that Malcolm IV is reported to have died childless at the age of twenty five, so the tale is questionable.

Later written accounts of the town date from the 15th century when it is referred to as ""Henderleithen"", and at this point it is recorded as a hamlet within the Parish of Traquair, which with its major baronial house was centre of the Parish.

The industrial revolution and wool milling saw Innerleithen outgrow Traquair and become the larger village.  Innerleithen's population rose from 1130 (1861 census) to its current level of over 2500. At one point it had five significant wool mills (or hosieries). Of these, only one, Caerlee Mills remained with a reduced workforce of 33 after its owners JJ & HB Cashmere went into administration in 2010, finally closing in April 2013.

The industries which have supplanted the wool industry and allowed the town to keep growing have been primarily tourism, of which Mountain Biking plays a huge part, and secondly, timber and forestry. Additionally, a significant proportion of the population now commutes to work, including to Edinburgh some 30 miles north.
The town has a football team, Vale of Leithen, who were established in 1891 and play in the Scottish Lowland League. They play their games at the town's Victoria Park.

Tourism

Tourist attractions within the town include Robert Smail's Printing Works and St. Ronans Wells, and nearby Traquair House. Popular tourist activities in the area include golfing (the town has a 9-hole golf course), walking and mountain biking with 2 excellent routes including a world standard downhill route. The area is famous for fly fishing (both trout and salmon), and there is a fish ladder near the golf course, just outside the town boundary on Leithen Road. This proves a popular stopping point for locals and visitors to watch the autumn and winter runs of salmon.

The town has several small hotels including the Traquair Arms Hotel and the St. Ronans Hotel. There are also numerous private houses offering bed and breakfast, a camp site and a caravan site.

The town hosts the annual Innerleithen Music Festival in the Memorial Hall. In addition, it has an active amateur operatic society which stages an annual production.

To get to Innerleithen from Edinburgh, follow the A701, then A703 south from Edinburgh, and at Peebles turn east onto the A72. The town is also served by the First Bus no. 62 service which runs between Edinburgh and Melrose via Penicuik, Peebles, Innerleithen and Galashiels.

Innerleithen has several bookshops, the largest of which holds nearly 19,000 titles and is one of the largest in the Scottish Borders.

Innerleithen is also popular for mountain biking and, together with Glentress, forms one of Forestry and Land Scotland's ""7 Stanes"".  It is very popular with downhill bikers and has hosted national events since the early 1990s.  Current gems include the ""Matador"" and ""Make or Break"".  In addition to the downhill trails, there is a long cross-country loop that climbs to the top of the Minch Moor before descending through some excellent trails.  The Innerleithen XC trails are more demanding than those found at Glentress.

Since 2003, the town has held a music festival every August. Acts that have played at the festival include Eddi Reader, Julie Fowlis, Dougie MacLean, Karine Polwart, Karen Matheson and Old Blind Dogs.

1940-01The private bank Merck Finck Privatbankiers AG, founded in 1870, is based in Munich and is also represented nationwide with a total of 16 locations. Since 2011, it has been a subsidiary of the Luxembourg bank KBL European Private Bankers (KLB), which was renamed Quintet Private Bank in January 2020.

History
Merck Finck was founded under the company Merck, Christian & Co. on 1 July 1870 by Adolf Karl Ludwig Christian and banker Heinrich Johann Merck. Other limited partners were the Darmstater Bank forerunner of the Danatbank and the entrepreneur Theodor von Cramer-Klett. By 1879, together with his brother August, who replaced the departing general Christian, the previous authorized representative Wilhelm von Finck already held a large part of the bank assets. As part of these changes, the bank was renamed Merck, Finck & Co.
The core business of the bank was corporate financing and issuing corporate bonds. The bank was involved in the founding of companies such as the Süddeutsche Bodencreditbank AG (1871), the brewery Bürgerliches Brauhaus München (1880), the Isarwerke GmbH (1894) and the Münchener Trambahn-AG. In 1890, Merck Finck subscribed for almost 40% of the share capital of Allianz Versicherungs-AG. As a representative of the bank, Wilhelm Finck often took on a supervisory board mandate with the shareholdings and thus brought his economic expertise to a wide variety of companies.

His work was honored in 1905 with the appointment to the Imperial Council of the Crown of Bavaria. This brought the family also the elevation to the hereditary peerage.

After the bank had developed positively in the deposit, lending and securities business at the turn of the century, the First World War interrupted the upswing. The capital market was heavily regulated. The period of inflation after the end of the war also prevented further expansion. Despite falling revenues, the bank was able to continue its operations without external help.

Another turning point was the death of Wilhelm von Finck in 1924. His share of the bank of nearly 100% was shared equally between his son August von Finck Sr. and his daughters Margarete von Stengel and Elisabeth Winterstein.

The death of William von Finck and the take over of the banking business by his son ushered in a new era. Merck Finck & Co. made a major contribution to the founding of aircraft construction and air traffic companies: with Udet-Flugzeugbau GmbH, a predecessor of today's DASA, and Süddeutsche Aero Lloyd AG, a predecessor to Lufthansa, important industry pioneers were created in Germany.

The global economic crisis imposed further restrictions on banking from 1929 onwards. Nevertheless, it was possible to participate in businesses like the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk, the sparkling wine cellar J. Oppmann and the Gesellschaft für Markt und Kühlhallen in Hamburg.

After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1938, Merck, Finck & Co. took the opportunity to acquire Wiener Privatbankhaus S. M. v. Rothschild. This highly renowned Austrian private bank, owned by Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild, had controlled the Österreichische Kreditanstalt until 1931. From July 1938 it was provisionally administered by Merck, Finck & Co., in 1940 it was ""made aryan"" by the newly founded bank E. v. Nicolai in Vienna; here Merck, Finck & Co. was involved with 71% and the German industrial bank (Düsseldorf) with 19%. After the Second World War the remaining values were given back to Louis Nathaniel von Rothschild, but he renounced the rebuilding of the bank S. M. v. Rothschild.

After a period between state influence and free enterprise under the Nazi regime, the bank Merck, Finck & Co. was completely paralyzed in post-war times, not least because of the involvement of the owners and senior executives in Nazi economic policy. It was not until 1949 that Merck Finck & Co. was able to resume business operations in the newly constructed bank building. The bank was now heavily involved in the securities industry. Through this and the support of August von Finck Jr. and later Wilhelm Winterstein August von Finck senior managed to re-enter the banking market.
In the following years, the bank expanded by founding new branches outside of Bavaria. Together with the family of steel industrialist Fritz von Waldthausen, the banking house Waldthausen & Co. was founded in 1954. Merck Finck & Co. took over the business of the banking house Alwin Steffan from Frankfurt am Main, to which it had longstanding connections, with the death of the senior partner in 1963.

Surprisingly August von Finck junior sold the bank for about DM 600 million to the British Barclays Bank Plc in October 1990. Due to tax reforms of the previous years undisclosed reserves that had been built up over generations were used up. In order to pay the taxes due, even parts of the over 100-year-old stock portfolio had been sold. The Barclays branches in Hamburg, Stuttgart and Berlin changed their name and became branches of Merck Finck & Co. However, as the broad retail banking of the new parent company was incompatible with private banking, which was firmly established in the bank, Barclays Bank sold Merck Finck in 1999 to KBL European Private Bankers (KBL epb), to which it has belonged ever since.

In 2002, Merck Finck acquired WestLB's German private banking unit. In 2005, the private banking business of Westfalenbank AG was acquired.

On 21 May 2010, the Indian investment company Hinduja Group announced that it would take over the KBL European Private Bankers division from the Belgian KBC Bank for €1.35 billion. However, on 16 March 2011 it became known that the Luxembourg financial regulator Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) refused to approve the sale. Thus, Merck Finck remained in the possession of the Belgian financial group KBC.

On October 10, 2011, it was announced that the Belgian KBC Group is selling its KBL European Private Bankers division for €1.05 billion to a Luxembourg holding called Precision Capital, which is backed by private individuals in Qatar. These belong to the family Al-Thani, which has shaped the political events of Qatar for about 200 years. The purchase was completed in July 2012. The KBL Group also includes the French Richelieu Banque Privée, Brown Shipley & Co in the UK and Theodoor Gilissen bankers in the Netherlands. On 1 September 2016, the private bank Merck Finck & Co changed its legal form, the Merck Finck & Co. oHG became Merck Finck Privatbankiers AG.

In January 2020, KBL European Private Bank changed its name to Quintet Private Bank and Merck Finck has since carried the addition ""A Quintet Private Bank"".

Criticism
The weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported in May 2014 that the adviser for large winners of the Westdeutsche Lotterie has conspicuously often mediated winners of large sums of money to the bank in order to invest the money over the long term. The article argues that lottery winners have often received poor advice and that asset classes such as ship funds and open-ended real estate funds have often led to losses. Westlotto denies that the employee would have had financial benefits from the negotiations.

In April 2014, the bank was convicted in one case because of falsely advising lottery winners. A married couple had won more than €6 million from Westlotto and invested them with Merck Finck & Co. The bank persuaded the couple to invest in so-called closed-end funds, which turned out to be uncertain, so that the couple lost a large part of the lottery prize. The Landgericht Münster established a false counsel and sentenced the bank to pay €510,000 to the couple.

It is the official language in Odisha (formerly rendered Orissa) where native speakers make up 82% of the population, and it is also spoken in parts of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Odia is one of the many official languages of India; it is the official language of Odisha and the second official language of Jharkhand. The language is also spoken by a sizeable population of at least 1 million people in Chhattisgarh.

Odia is the sixth Indian language to be designated a Classical language, on the basis of having a long literary history and not having borrowed extensively from other languages. The earliest known inscription in Odia dates back to the 10th century CE.

History
Odia is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Aryan language family. It is thought to be directly descended from an Odra Prakrit, which was spoken in east India over 1,500 years ago, and is the primary language used in early Jain and Buddhist texts. Odia appears to have had relatively little influence from Persian and Arabic, compared to other major Indo-Aryan languages.

The history of the Odia language is divided into eras:

 Proto Odia (12th century and earlier): Inscriptions from 10th century onwards provide evidence for the existence of the Old Odia language, although the earliest known inscription that actually contains Odia lines is dated to 1249 CE.
 Early Middle Odia (1200–1400): The earliest use of prose can be found in the Madala Panji of the Jagannath Temple at Puri, which dates back to the 12th century. Such works as Shishu Veda, Amara Kosha, Gorakha Samhita, Kalasha Chautisha, and Saptanga are written in this form of Odia.
 Middle Odia (1400–1700): Sarala Das writes the Vilanka Ramayana. Towards the 16th century, poets emerged around the Vaishnava leader Achyutananda, These five poets are Balaram Das, Jagannatha Das, Achyutananda, Ananta Das and Jasobanta Das.
 Late Middle Odia (1700–1850): Ushabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Das, the Rahasya Manjari of Deba Durlabha Dasa and the Rukmini Bibaha of Kartika Dasa were written. A new form of metrical epic-poems (called Chhanda-Kabya) evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote Haravali. Upendra Bhanja took a leading role in this period- his creations Baidehisha Bilasa, Koti Brahmanda Sundari, Labanyabati were landmarks in Odia Literature. Dinakrushna Das's Rasokallola and Abhimanyu Samanta Singhara's Bidagdha Chintamani are prominent Kavyas of this time. Four major poets emerged in the end of the era are Baladeba Rath, Bhima Bhoi, Brajanath Badajena and Gopala Krushna Pattanaik.
 Modern Odia (1850 till present day): The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by the Christian missionaries which made a great revolution in Odia literature and language.

Charyapada of 8th Century and its affinity with Odia
The beginning of Odia poet coincides with the development of Charya sahitya, the literature started by Vajrayana Buddhist poets such as in the Charyapada. This literature was written in a specific metaphor called twilight language and prominent poets included Luipa, Tilopa and Kanha. Quite importantly, the ragas that are mentioned for singing the Charyapadas are found abundantly in later Odia literature.

Poet Jayadeva's literary contribution
Jayadeva was a Sanskrit poet. He was born in an Utkala Brahmin family of Puri in circa 1200 CE. He is most known for his composition, the epic poem Gita Govinda, which depicts the divine love of the Hindu deity Krishna and his consort, Radha, and is considered an important text in the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. About the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, the influence of Jayadeva's literary contribution changed the pattern of versification in Odia.

Geographical distribution

India
Odia is mainly spoken in the state of Odisha, but there are significant Odia-speaking populations in the neighbouring states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.

Due to the increasing migration of labour, the west Indian state of Gujarat also has a significant population of Odia speakers. Significant numbers of Odia speakers can also be found in the cities of Vishakhapatnam, Hyderabad, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Chennai, Goa, Mumbai, Raipur, Jamshedpur, Baroda, Ahmedabad, New Delhi, Guwahati, Shillong, Pune, Gurgaon, Jammu and Silvassa According to 2011 census, 3.1% of Indians in India are Odia speakers, of which 93% belong to Odisha.

Foreign countries
The Odia diaspora constitute a sizeable number in several countries around the world, totalling the number of Odia speakers on a global scale to 50 million. It has a significant presence in eastern countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, mainly carried by the sadhaba, ancient traders from Odisha who carried the language along with the culture during the old-day trading, and in western countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia and England. The language has also spread to Burma, Malaysia, Fiji, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Middle East countries. It is spoken as a native tongue by the Bonaz community in northeastern Bangladesh.

Phonology

Odia has 30 consonant phonemes, 2 semivowel phonemes and 6 vowel phonemes.

Length is not contrastive. Final vowels are pronounced in the standard language, e.g. Odia  contrasts Bengali  ""flower"".

Odia retains the voiced retroflex lateral approximant , among the Eastern Indo-Aryan languages. The velar nasal  is given phonemic status in some analyses, as it occurs also as a Final velar nasal [ŋ]. E.g.- ଏବଂ- ebaṅ (ebɔŋ) Nasals assimilate for place in nasal–stop clusters.  have the flap allophones  in intervocalic position and in final position (but not at morpheme boundaries). Stops are sometimes deaspirated between  and a vowel or an open syllable +vowel and a vowel. Some speakers distinguish between single and geminate consonants.

Grammar

Odia retains most of the cases of Sanskrit, though the nominative and vocative have merged (both without a separate marker), as have the accusative and dative. There are three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and two grammatical numbers (singular and plural). However there are no grammatical gender. The usage of gender is semantic, i.e. to differentiate male member of a class from female member.  There are three true tenses (present, past and future), others being formed with auxiliaries.

Writing system

The Odia language uses Odia script (also known as the Kalinga script). It is a Brahmic script used to write primarily Odia language and others like Sanskrit and several minor regional languages. The script has developed over nearly 1000 years with the earliest trace of the script being dated to 1051 AD. It is a syllabic alphabet or an abugida, wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel embedded within.

Odia is a syllabic alphabet or an abugida wherein all consonants have an inherent vowel embedded within. Diacritics (which can appear above, below, before, or after the consonant they belong to) are used to change the form of the inherent vowel. When vowels appear at the beginning of a syllable, they are written as independent letters. Also, when certain consonants occur together, special conjunct symbols are used to combine the essential parts of each consonant symbol.

The curved appearance of the Odia script is a result of the practice of writing on palm leaves, which have a tendency to tear if you use too many straight lines.

Odia Script

Literature

The earliest literature in Odia language can be traced to the Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries. Before Sarala Das, the most important works in Odia literature are the Shishu Veda, Saptanga, Amara Kosha, Rudrasudhanidhi, Kesaba Koili, Kalasha Chautisha etc. In the 14th century, the poet Sarala Das wrote the Sarala Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, in praise of the goddess Durga. Rama-Bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in the Odia language.

The following era is termed the Panchasakha Age and stretches until the year 1700. The period begins with the writings of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu whose Vaishnava influence brought in a new evolution in Odia literature.  Notable religious works of the Panchasakha Age include those of Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Yasovanta, Ananta and Acyutananda. The authors of this period mainly translated, adapted, or imitated Sanskrit literature. Other prominent works of the period include the Usabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Dasa, the Rahasya-manjari of Debadurlabha Dasa and the Rukmini-bibha of Kartikka Dasa. A new form of novels in verse evolved during the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote Haravali. Other poets like Madhusudana, Bhima Bhoi, Dhivara, Sadasiva and Sisu Isvara-dasa composed another form called kavyas (long poems) based on themes from Puranas, with an emphasis on plain, simple language.

However, during the Bhanja Age (also known as the Age of Riti Yuga) beginning with turn of the 18th century, verbally tricky Odia became the order of the day. Verbal jugglery, eroticism characterise the period between 1700 and 1850, particularly in the works of the era's eponymous poet Upendra Bhanja (1670–1720). Bhanja's work inspired many imitators of which the most notable is Arakshita Das. Family chronicles in prose relating religious festivals and rituals are also characteristic of the period.

The first Odia printing typeset was cast in 1836 by Christian missionaries. Although the handwritten Odia script of the time closely resembled the Bengali and Assamese scripts, the one adopted for the printed typesets was significantly different, leaning more towards the Tamil script and Telugu script. Amos Sutton produced an Oriya Bible (1840), Oriya Dictionary (1841–43) and An Introductory Grammar of Oriya (1844).

Odia has a rich literary heritage dating back to the thirteenth century. Sarala Dasa who lived in the fourteenth century is known as the Vyasa of Odisha. He translated the Mahabharata into Odia. In fact, the language was initially standardised through a process of translating classical Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Srimad Bhagabata Gita. The translation of the Srimad Bhagabata Gita by Jagannatha Dasa was particularly influential on the written form of the language. Odia has had a strong tradition of poetry, especially devotional poetry.

Other eminent Odia poets include Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja and Kabisurya Baladev Ratha.

Classical Odia literature is inextricably tied to music, and most of it was written for singing, set to traditional Odissi ragas and talas. These compositions form the core of the system of Odissi music, the classical music of the state.

Prose in the language has had a late development.

Three great poets and prose writers, Kabibar Radhanath Ray (1849–1908), Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843–1918) and Madhusudan Rao (1853–1912) made Odia their own. They brought in a modern outlook and spirit into Odia literature. Around the same time the modern drama took birth in the works of Rama Sankara Ray beginning with Kanci-Kaveri (1880).

Among the contemporaries of Fakir Mohan, four novelists deserve special mention: Aparna Panda, Mrutyunjay Rath, Ram Chandra Acharya and Brajabandhu Mishra. Aparna Panda's Kalavati and Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati were both published in 1902, the year in which Chha Mana Atha Guntha came out in the book form. Brajabandhu Mishra's Basanta Malati, which came out from Bamanda, depicts the conflict between a poor but highly educated young man and a wealthy and highly egoistic young woman whose conjugal life is seriously affected by ego clashes. Through a story of union, separation and reunion, the novelist delineates the psychological state of a young woman in separation from her husband and examines the significance of marriage as a social institution in traditional Indian society. Ram Chandra Acharya wrote about seven novels during 1924–1936. All his novels are historical romances based on the historical events in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Odisha. Mrutyunjay Rath's novel, Adbhuta Parinama, published in 1915, centres round a young Hindu who gets converted to Christianity to marry a Christian girl.

One of the great writers in the 20th century was Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar (1907–1995) from Cuttack, who wrote many books for children like Pari Raija, Kuhuka Raija, Panchatantra, Adi Jugara Galpa Mala, etc. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1971–72 for his contributions to Odia literature, development of children's fiction, and biographies.

One of the prominent writers of the 20th and 21st centuries was Muralidhar Mallick (1927–2002). His contribution to Historical novels is beyond words. He was last felicitated by the Sahitya Academy in the year 1998 for his contributions to Odia literature. His son Khagendranath Mallick (born 1951) is also a writer. His contribution towards poetry, criticism, essays, story and novels is commendable. He was the former President of Utkal Kala Parishad and also former President of Odisha Geeti Kabi Samaj. Presently he is a member of the Executive Committee of Utkal Sahitya Samaj. Another illustrious writer of the 20th century was Mr. Chintamani Das. A noted academician, he was written more than 40 books including fiction, short stories, biographies and storybooks for children. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village under Satyabadi block, Chintamani Das is the only writer who has written biographies on all the five 'Pancha Sakhas' of Satyabadi namely Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihara, Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Pandit Godabarisha. Having served as the Head of the Odia department of Khallikote College, Berhampur, Chintamani Das was felicitated with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his outstanding contribution to Odia literature in general and Satyabadi Yuga literature in particular. Some of his well-known literary creations are 'Bhala Manisha Hua', 'Manishi Nilakantha', 'Kabi Godabarisha', 'Byasakabi Fakiramohan', 'Usha', 'Barabati'.

20th century writers in Odia include Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal, Gangadhar Meher, Chintamani Mahanti and Kuntala Kumari Sabat, besides Niladri Dasa and Gopabandhu Das. The most notable novelists were Umesa Sarakara, Divyasimha Panigrahi, Gopala Chandra Praharaj and Kalindi Charan Panigrahi. Sachi Kanta Rauta Ray is the great introducer of the ultra-modern style in modern Odia poetry. Others who took up this form were Godabarisha Mohapatra, Mayadhar Mansingh, Nityananda Mahapatra and Kunjabihari Dasa. Prabhasa Chandra Satpathi is known for his translations of some western classics apart from Udayanatha Shadangi, Sunanda Kara and Surendranatha Dwivedi. Criticism, essays and history also became major lines of writing in the Odia language. Esteemed writers in this field were Professor Girija Shankar Ray, Pandit Vinayaka Misra, Professor Gauri Kumara Brahma, Jagabandhu Simha and Harekrushna Mahatab. Odia literature mirrors the industrious, peaceful and artistic image of the Odia people who have offered and gifted much to the Indian civilisation in the field of art and literature. Now Writers Manoj Das's creations motivated and inspired people towards a positive lifestyle. Distinguished prose writers of the modern period include Baidyanath Misra, Fakir Mohan Senapati, Madhusudan Das, Godabarisha Mohapatra, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Surendra Mohanty, Manoj Das, Kishori Charan Das, Gopinath Mohanty, Rabi Patnaik, Chandrasekhar Rath, Binapani Mohanty, Bhikari Rath, Jagadish Mohanty, Sarojini Sahoo, Yashodhara Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Padmaja Pal. But it is poetry that makes modern Odia literature a force to reckon with. Poets like Kabibar Radhanath Ray, Sachidananda Routray, Guruprasad Mohanty, Soubhagya Misra, Ramakanta Rath, Sitakanta Mohapatra, Rajendra Kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy have made significant contributions towards Indian poetry.

Anita Desai's novella, Translator Translated, from her collection The Art of Disappearance, features a translator of a fictive Odia short story writer; the novella contains a discussion of the perils of translating works composed in regional Indian languages into English.

Four writers in Odia – Gopinath Mohanty, Sachidananda Routray, Sitakant Mahapatra and Pratibha Ray – have been awarded the Jnanpith, an Indian literary award.

1,413,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type2,"The Packard Motor Car Company introduced their first four-cylinder engine in 1903 initially as a top level car along with the Packard Model F. It was their only automobile offered and exclusively used a four-cylinder engine from 1903 until 1912 and established Packard as a luxury car maker, and was replaced by the 1913 Packard Six.

History 

The first four-cylinder equipped car was introduced as the 1903 Model K with rear entrance tonneau or King of Belgium tonneau body styles. It introduced a number of firsts for the company, to include installing the engine in front of the passenger compartment and the radiator with a grille, with a four speed transmission using a  wheelbase. Production was limited to 34 with a retail price of US$7,300 ($ in  dollars ) making it the most expensive Packard manufactured. Packard engineer Charles Schmidt raced a Model K Gray Wolf at Ormond-Daytona Beach and achieved 77.6 mph.

The 1904 Model L & Model M introduced the characteristic sculpted radiator and flat hood appearance, while the body was constructed in aluminum over wood frame. The standard body color was painted Richelieu blue with black molding with cream yellow striping, while the running gear was painted cream yellow with black and blue striping. Three body styles were offered adding a surrey and runabout to the previous tonneau, with a retail price of US$3,000 ($ in  dollars ).

Another first for the company was introduced with the 1905 Model N, adding a touring sedan, brougham, and limousine to the runabout, while the surrey was omitted. The wheelbase was extended to . Retail prices started at US$3,600 to US$4,600 for the limousine ($ in  dollars ).

1906 saw more mechanical and appearance advancements on the Model S, which was also marketed as the Model 24, referring to a claimed 24 bhp T-head engine. Two wheelbases were offered for the first time, where the runabout used a , while the touring sedan, limousine, landaulet, and victoria used the longer . Another trademark appearance feature was introduced; the hexagon shaped hubcap, which had the center painted black until 1913 when it was changed to red and remained so until the company closed. The Landaulet could be purchased for US$5,225 ($ in  dollars ).

For 1907 Packard changed the model designation from letters to engine horsepower, so it was now identified as the Model Thirty Series U (spelled out instead of a number). Prices at introduction started with $4200 for open models and went up to $5500 for the limousine and $5600 for the landaulet. Two wheelbases were offered with the runabout bodystyle on the  while the touring sedan, limousine and landaulet using the .

Packard continued its focus on continuous improvement, and for 1908 the Model Thirty added a second designation called the Series UA. The runabout used the  wheelbase while the Touring Sedan and Limousine used the longer  wheelbase and the Touring Coupe was now available with a rumble seat.

In 1909, Packard decided to offer an affordable choice to widen their customer base, and introduced the Model Eighteen Series NA which was priced US$1,000 lower ($ in  dollars ). The Model Eighteen offered a smaller engine and shorter wheelbase, while the Model Thirty Series UB and UBS remained the upper level vehicle. The Series UB designation was for the longer wheelbase, while the Series UBS designation was for the shorter wheelbase shared with the Model Eighteen. As body styles continued to adapt to customer requests, Packard offered a Demi-Limousine to its list of available coach offerings on both the Model Eighteen with a  wheelbase, and Model Thirty using a  wheelbase.

The lower priced platform returned for 1910 as the Model Eighteen Series NB and was mechanically related to the previous year, while the demi-limousine didn't return as an available body style and only four choices remained. The Model Thirty Series UC and UCS added a phaeton, demi-limousine and town car to the list of body styles along with shock absorbers to smooth the ride. Engine choices and wheelbases remained unchanged.

A 1911 Four-door Landaulet cost $5,750. Standard equipment included oil lamps, a tool kit, and two extra demountable rims. The closed cars also included speaking tubes, adjustable ventilators, and a dome light that had a separate battery. There was a speedometer and an air-pressure gauge. Wheelbase was 123 1/2"" for the standard chassis.

In 1911 Packard introduced the Packard Six as a 1912 model and phased out the four-cylinder Model 30 Series UE and Model 18 Series NE.

Engine  and drivetrain
A plate clutch was blocked with the engine. Power was transmitted by a long shaft with universal joints to the three-speed sliding-gear manual gearbox with reverse. This was located in a housing at the rear axle which also contained the differential. The car used shaft drive from the beginning, although many other high-powered cars at this time relied on double-chain drive.

In 1909, redesigned linkage in the transmission made it possible for the reverse gear to be activated with the regular gear-shift. Since 1904, all Packards had had a separate lever for the reverse gear.

Chassis 
The ladder-type frame used semielliptical leaf springs front and rear. Steering included now ball bearings instead of roller types, and featured a Pitman arm in front of the front axle.

Brakes were mechanical on the rear wheels only, working either by pedal (external contracting) or lever (internal expanding). Following the owner's manual, either was sufficient for stopping under normal conditions.

Packard FourFrederick George Burgess (16 July 1871 – 31 March 1951) was a British politician and trade unionist.

Burgess worked on the railways for many years and became active in the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and its successor, the National Union of Railwaymen.  Increasingly holding prominent offices in the union, including secretary of the Maidstone branch for seventeen years, he also served on various government committees during World War I.  He also became active in the Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully for Maidstone at the 1918 general election.  Despite his lack of success, he left the railway industry the following year (refusing a post as night porter at NUR headquarters), and worked as a political agent and lecturer, also producing political cartoons and articles under the pseudonym of ""Battersea Bowser"".

At the 1929 general election, Burgess stood in York and won the seat.  He lost it at the 1931 general election, then moved to contest Accrington in 1935, but was again unsuccessful.  In 1937, he was elected to represent Camberwell North West on London County Council, serving until 1949.  He also served on Camberwell Metropolitan Borough Council. He served as Camberwell's mayor from 1947 until 1949, taking over from his wife Jessie Burgess who held the role from 1945 to 1947.

The name comes from the Nahuatl language, Xoxo-oco-tlan: “place where there are green pines"". Formerly part of Puente de Ixtla, it became its own indigenous municipality on 1 January 2019. It recorded a population of 21,074 inhabitants in the 2010 Mexican census.

The new municipality is formed by the colonies: Cerrado del Venado, Hermosa, Loma Linda, Arboledas del Sur, La Toma, Palo Prieto, Campo Corbeta, Shaya Michan, Tierra Alta, Campo Xolistlán and Palo Prieto Fraccionamiento. It also includes the Xoxocotla Ejido fields. Zacatepec challenged the inclusion of the  of Shaya Michan.

According to the agreement, the people of the new municipality will be ruled according to traditional usos y costumbres (uses and customs), and they will be required to assume part of the public debt of Puente de Ixtla. Eight months after its formation, the municipality is still struggling to resolve its differences with Puente de Ixtla.

Other Indigenous communities that were granted autonomy are Coatetelco and Hueyapan.

History
Puente de Ixtla was established as a municipality in 1869, and on July 12, 1871, it annexed Xoxocotla, Tehuixtla, and the hacienda of San José. Later Xoxocotla became part of the municipality of Jojutla.

Xoxocotla had to be evacuated in 1913—1914 due to fighting during the Mexican Revolution.

In 2010 the Pueblos Magico (""Magical Towns"") program was created to promote tourism in certain states and municipalities of the country. Puente de Ixtla did not qualify for the program, but in 2018 Morelos set up its own promotional program called Pueblos con Encanto (""Charmed Towns"") including Puente de Ixtla (and by extension, Xococotla). 

The Third Indigenous Book Fair took place in Xoxocotla on February 18, 2016. Poet Arnulfo Soriano of Xoxocotla presented a book of poems. Xoxocotla and Santa Ana Tlacotenco, Milpa Alta were declared Sister Cities.

Members of the National Guard were sent to Xoxocotla during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico to help enforce lockdown orders and social distancing. As of May 4, 2020, there were 505 infections and 59 deaths in the state of Morelos and nine confirmed infections from coronavirus in Xoxocatla. Rumors of hundreds of cases in three days caused residents in Alpuyeca and other nearby communities to block the entrance of Xoxos (as the people are called).The state health department (Coprisem) closed a clandestine crematorium in Xoxocotla on June 2 as the state reached 1,477 cases and 290 deaths. Xoxocoatla reported 100 cases, 62 recuperations, and 38 deaths from the virus as of August 31. One hundred eighteen cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

70,417,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type1,"The New Milford Center Historic District encompasses much of the traditional civic and commercial heart of New Milford, Connecticut.

Description and history
New Milford's town center was originally focused around its town green, a long three-block greensward located just east of the present downtown area.  This remained the focus of civic and commercial activity until the Housatonic Railroad opened in 1840.  The area between the green and the railroad then developed as a commercial hub, as the town grew to become a major service center for surrounding communities.  Later in the 19th century, as tobacco became a major crop in the Housatonic River valley, New Milford also became a center for the drying and processing of tobacco leaves, an industry that was one of its largest employers.  As a result of these growth patterns, the downtown area features architecturally significant buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and some of its surrounding residential areas have significant housing stock from that period.

The historic district is roughly bounded on the east by East Street and South Main Street, the south by Mill Street, the west by South Main Street and Railroad Street (excluding many of the buildings on the latter roadway), and on the north by Bennitt and Elm Streets.  Prominent features include one of the state's longest town greens, which is lined mainly by civic and residential buildings, and the cluster of commercial brick and stone buildings along Bank and Main Streets near the southern end of the green.  Residential areas with fine 19th-century Victorian houses fringe the district, on South Main, East, and Bennitt Streets.  Separately listed buildings on the National Register that are in the district include the United Bank Building and the E. A. Wildman & Co. Tobacco Warehouse; the district excludes the separately listed railroad station.

Early life and education
Small was born on 12 May 1905 in North Berwick, East Lothian, Scotland. He was educated at North Berwick High School, the state secondary school in his home town. He studied classics at the University of Edinburgh and theology at New College, Edinburgh.

Career

Ordained ministry
Small was ordained into the Church of Scotland (the Kirk) in 1931. From 1931 to 1935, he was minister of St John's Church, Bathgate, West Lothian. He then translated to West High Church, Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, where he was a minister from 1935 to 1944. The latter part of this ministry coincided with World War II. He served for a period in mainland Europe with the Church of Scotland's ""Huts and Canteens"" organisation. In 1940, he was serving as a chaplain in France when the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk; he left the country via Saint-Nazaire and narrowly avoided travelling on the doomed RMS Lancastria.

From 1944 to 1956, he was minister of Cramond Church, Edinburgh. He maintained a link with his war work as Convener of the Committee on Huts and Canteens for HM Forces from 1946 to 1958. He then translated to St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh, a much larger church. During this period of ministry he continued to be involved in management of the Kirk: he was Convener of the Committee on Temperance and Morals from 1958 to 1963, Convener of the Social and Moral Welfare Board 1963 to 1964, and Convener of the Stewardship and Budget Committee from 1964 to 1969. He rose to be head of the Kirk as Moderator of the General Assembly from 1966 to 1967. After his term as Moderator, he was appointed Chaplain to the Queen in Scotland and continued as minister of St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh.

He retired from full-time ministry in 1975 and was appointed Extra Chaplain to the Queen.

Football career
Small, a goalkeeper, was captain of the football team while studying at Edinburgh University and joined Scottish Second Division side St. Bernard's after he graduated. He was capped by Scotland at amateur level in 1929.

Honours
He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year Honours.

97,419,2051-2-2 00:00:00,note_type7,"The Argentine law 24,012 or Argentine quota law () seeks to increase the number of women in government in Argentina, by setting quotas for the minimum representation of women on the ballots of each party at the legislative elections. The law was enacted in 1991, during the presidency of Carlos Menem, and was the first gender quota law to be passed in Latin America. Following Argentina's lead, eleven other Latin American countries have since introduced gender quotas to increase female representation at the national level.

Description
The number of female legislators elected in the 1983 general election (the first election after the National Reorganization Process) was minimal. In 1989, legislation to ensure larger representation of women was introduced by the Radical Civic Union and supported by women legislators from other parties. After initial debate in September 1990, in November 1991 the bill was passed by a large majority of the Chamber of Deputies. President Carlos Menem also favored the proposal. It became law as an amendment to the National Electoral Code. Initially, only the women who were not allowed in the party list in the required quota could request in court the compliance of the law; it was amended later to allow any citizen to denounce parties that did not follow the quota.

The law sets a quota of female candidates for each party, which must be both a 80% of the total of candidates, and at least one for each third name in the rank. The success of the law is caused by the characteristics of the Argentine electoral system. The parties offer a closed list of candidates, with fixed ranks, and voters must vote for the whole list of a given party. The large district magnitude helps as well.

Results
The quota law made a huge impact. The Argentine Chamber of Deputies initiated 64 female deputies in 1995, 76 in 2001, and 93 in 2005. The respective percentages were 24.9%, 30% and 36.2% of the plenum. The law did not initially apply in the Argentine Senate, which worked with indirect elections. The electoral system for the Senate switched to direct elections in 1995, dramatically raising the number of female senators, who accounted for 2.8% of the senate in 1995 and 33.3% in 2001. By 2007, 33% of deputies and 24% of senators in the Argentine legislature were female. Although the number of women in office has increased, Elisa Maria Carrio (2012) notes that the male politicians who still dominate Argentina's political parties often place the name of their wives or other female family members on ballots, with the expectation that they will have control over the women's actions once they are elected.

Most provinces of Argentina enacted similar laws for their domestic elections, each one fitting into the context of their local laws. Each province has a provincial legislature; as of October 2003, female deputies accounted for 27.9% and female senators accounted for 20.4% of provincial legislatures.

Following Argentina's lead, eleven other countries in Latin America and South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru) adopted similar gender quota laws during the following decade, with varying effects on women's share of legislative seats. A twelfth country, Venezuela, also adopted a quota law, but later rescinded it. In the 2006 election, the quota law in Ecuador contributed to increasing the representation of women in the nation's legislature from 15% to 25%. In Honduras, the institution of a quota law helped increase women's share of legislative seats to 23% after the 2005 election, having been only 5.5% previously.

20th-century American peopleDestroyer Squadron 7 (DesRon 7) is a naval unit of the United States Navy stationed in Singapore. It is assigned to the United States Seventh Fleet.

Command history

1920-1922
Destroyer Squadron 7 (DesRon 7) was first established in September 1920 as a reserve squadron of 15 destroyers homeported at Charleston, South Carolina (USA). The squadron was deactivated in July 1922.

1939-1945
In April 1939, DesRon 7 was reactivated at Naval Base San Diego, California. In December 1940, the squadron was reformed at Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. It was equipped with newly built Benson- and Gleaves-class destroyers between June and September 1940.
In December 1940, DesRon 7 consisted of the Destroyer Divisions (DesDiv) 13 and 14 with the following ships:

Between March and December 1941, DesRon 7 operated 31 in the ""Atlantic Convoy Support Force""  from Argentia, Newfoundland and Iceland with the Wickes- and s of DesRon 30 and DesRon 31. During these “short-of-war” operations, Niblack fired the first U.S. depth charges of the war on 10 April 1941 (on the German submarine U-52), while rescuing survivors the Dutch cargo ship Saleier. On 31 October, Niblack and Hilary P. Jones rescued 45 survivors of  which was sunk by a torpedo attack from German submarine U-552 near Iceland on 31 October 1941. 
On 3 September 1942, while escorting Convoy TA-18, bound for New York City, a large fire broke out aboard the troop transport . Mayo and the light cruiser  closed to windward to take off passengers, a badly-burned officer, and members of the crew not needed to man pumps and hoses. Other survivors were disembarked by boat and raft, to be picked up forthwith by the screening ships, among them Niblack and Hilary P. Jones. DesRon 7 continued to serve in the Atlantic Ocean until the Allied invasion of Sicily in August 1943, when Plunkett and Gleaves accepted the surrender of the small island of Ustica in the Tyrrhenian Sea.

The following month, Plunkett and the ships of DesDiv 13 operated in the screen of the Southern Attack Force during the Allied invasion of Italy. On 9 October 1943, Gleaves and a British LCT rescued 57 survivors of  which had been sunk by the German submarine U-616 off the coast of Salerno when it was working in support of Operation Avalanche.
DesDiv13 (less Benson) operated with the multinational Task Force 81 in “Operation Shingle,” the landings at Anzio, in January 1944. While providing fire support, Mayo succeeded in breaking up a German counterattack 23 January, before she was heavily damaged by a mine the following day. Plunkett suffered major damage from a bomb hit on the same day.
On 20 April 1944, Lansdale was torpedoed and sunk by German bombers off the coast of Algeria while escorting Convoy UGS-37. Gleaves and Hilary P. Jones sank the German submarine U-616 with other ships and aircraft off Spain on 17 May 1944. Afterwards they rescued 53 members of her crew. Niblack and Ludlow sank the German submarine U-960 north-west of Algiers with gunfire on 19 May 1944.

In August and September 1944, DesDiv 13 participated Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France. Hilary P. Jones provided gunfire support missions during the assault, but also acted as electronic jamming vessel in the successful attempt to prevent radio-controlled bombs from harassing the area. In the weeks that followed she continued to range up and down the coast in support of the First Airborne Task Force destroying bridges, gun emplacements, railroad facilities and coastal vessels. She was attacked by a German E-boat 21 August, but destroyed the craft with gunfire. For her outstanding record during this period the ship received the Navy Unit Commendation.

Convoy duty and overhauls followed these actions. In the spring of 1945, DesRon 7 was transferred to the Pacific Ocean, where it was mainly engaged in escort duties. Benson, Mayo, Madison and Hilary P. Jones entered Tokyo Bay on  2 September 1945 during the surrender ceremony. Returning to the United States, DesRon 7 was deactivated in November 1945.

1946 - present
In January 1946, DesRon 60 was redesignated DesRon 7. Ships of the squadron participated in Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. The squadron saw extended action during the Korean War, including the Battle of Inchon. During the Vietnam War, the squadron was deployed in support of Operation Market Time and engaged in shore bombardments.

In January and February 1979, DesRon 7 participated in the evacuation of Americans from Iran during the Iranian Revolution. During the 1991 Gulf War, the commander of DesRon 7 acted as the ""North Arabian Gulf Local Anti-Surface Warfare Commander"" and directed multi-national forces in offensive operations which eliminated the Iraqi Navy.

In 1994-2003, DesRon 7 was assigned the battle group of the aircraft carrier . In 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1999, DesRon 7 participated in Operation Southern Watch in the Arabian Gulf.

In 2002, the following ships were assigned to DesRon 7:

From 2004 to 2012, DesRon 7 was assigned to the battle group of the newly commissioned aircraft carrier .

In December 2012, DesRon 7 shifted its homeport to Singapore where it acts as the tactical commander of littoral combat ships rotationally deployed to Southeast Asia. It also leads the execution of the CARAT exercises. Exercise CARAT is a series of annual bilateral military exercises conducted by the United States Pacific Fleet with several member nations in Southeast Asia since 1995.

It was based on Handley's radio show It's That Man Again. In the film, the mayor of a small town lends his assistance to some drama students.

Plot
The disreputable mayor (Tommy Handley) of small town Foaming-at-the-Mouth gambles the civic accounts and wins a bombed out local theatre. He steals the rights to a new play which he stages in an attempt to save the financial situation. However, local drama students he has cheated turn up and try to ruin the show.

Critical reception
TV Guide wrote: ""This wartime comedy has some genuinely funny moments but never rises to the fevered pitch that would really give it the needed craziness. The story is taken from a delightfully loopy British radio show, but the translation to screen just doesn't work"". Radio Times has called it ""disappointing,"" commenting on Tommy Handley, ""the Liverpool-born comic's fast-talking style felt forced when shackled to the demands of a storyline, and his weaknesses as a physical comedian restricted the type of business he was able to carry off. Thus, while casting him as the devious mayor of Foaming-at-the-Mouth seemed sound enough, the events that follow his acquisition of a bombed-out London theatre feel like so much padding."" The Spinning Image was more positive, ""if you approached it as a British predecessor to the Hollywood cult comedy Hellzapoppin' then you would have some idea of what to expect, with Handley demonstrating his dazzling ability with wordplay, reeling off the puns at a dizzying rate...Anarchic was the word to apply here, with the show they manage to get off the ground for the finale surprisingly hilarious in its throwing in everything but the kitchen sink style of laughs; before that it was patchily amusing, but engaging enough. As a record of a comedy phenomenon – twenty-two million listeners, as the titles proclaim – this was invaluable.""

British black-and-white filmsTeunis Garret Bergen (October 6, 1806 – April 24, 1881) was an American politician and a United States Representative from New York.

Biography
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Bergen was the son of Garrett and Jane Wyckoff Bergen and the second cousin of John Teunis Bergen, also a U. S. Representative from New York. He attended the common schools and Erasmus Hall Academy (in Flatbush). He married Elizabeth Roelof Van Brunt on December 19, 1827, and they had one son, Garrett T. Bergen. His family owned at least 46 enslaved people in 1810.

Bergen engaged in agricultural pursuits and surveying and was supervisor of New Utrecht, Kings County, New York, from 1836 to 1859. He was a member of the New York constitutional conventions in 1846, 1867, and 1868, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions at Baltimore and Charleston in 1860.

Bergen was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-ninth Congress and served as U. S. Representative for the second district of New York holding office from March 4, 1865, to March 3, 1867.  He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866 and resumed agricultural pursuits and surveying near New Utrecht, and also engaged in literary and historical work.

Having served as ensign, captain, adjutant, and lieutenant colonel, Bergen was colonel of the Two Hundred and Forty-first Regiment, New York State Militia (known as Kings County Troop).

Death
Bergen died in Brooklyn, Kings County, New York, on April 24, 1881 (age 74 years, 200 days). He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

Credited Eponyms
New York City (NYC) Public School 9 in Brooklyn, NY (PS 9 Teunis G. Bergen) was named after Teunis G. Bergen.  His name was also given to a street and two subway stations in Brooklyn, (the 2 and 3 trains running along Flatbush Ave and the F and G trains along Court Street).

The Teunis G. Bergen School was renamed in 2019 to Sarah Smith Garnet Public School. Named after Sarah J. Garnet the first Black woman to serve as a principal in NYC. The name change followed a movement to remove the slaveholding Bergen family name from a school whose students are 40 percent African American. An article surfaced from June 14, 1819, in which Teunis' uncle, Teunis J. Bergen, and Michael Bergen had offering a reward of $40 for the return of Sam and Dinah, an African American couple who had escaped from slavery on the Bergen estate along with their three-year-old child.

85,425,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type6,"The  Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, originally the Convention for Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution, and often simply referred to as the Barcelona Convention, is a regional convention adopted in 1976 to prevent and abate pollution from ships, aircraft and land based sources in the Mediterranean Sea. This includes but is not limited to dumping, run-off and discharges. Signers agreed to cooperate and assist in dealing with pollution emergencies, monitoring and scientific research. The convention was adopted on 16 February 1976 and amended on 10 June 1995.

The Barcelona Convention and its protocols form the legal framework of the Mediterranean Action Plan (approved in 1975), developed under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Regional Seas Programme.

Goals 
The key goal of the convention is to ""reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development"". To achieve this a number of aims and commitments have been established.

Aims 
To prevent, reduce, combat and, as far as possible, eliminate pollution in the Zone of the Mediterranean Sea.
To attain the objective of sustainable development, taking fully into account the recommendations of the Mediterranean Commission on Sustainable Development (MCSD), the advisory body established under Article 4 of the Convention.
To protect the environment and to contribute to sustainable development:
By applying the precautionary principle and that the polluter should pay
By performing Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA)
By promoting cooperation between coastal States in EIA procedures.
To promote the integrated management of coastal zones, taking into account the protection of zones of ecological and landscape interest and the rational use of natural resources. To apply the Convention and its Protocols:
By adopting programmes and measures with defined deadlines for completion.
By using the best techniques available and the best environmental practices.
To formulate and adopt Protocols that prescribe agreed measures, procedures and regulations to apply the convention.
To promote, within the relevant international bodies, measures relating to the application of sustainable development programmes and environmental protection, conservation and rehabilitation and the natural resources of the Mediterranean Sea.

Commitments 
Members agreed to take specific measures:

against pollution due to dumping from ships and air planes 
against pollution due to discharges from ships,
against pollution caused by prospection for, and exploitation of, the continental shelf, the seabed and its subsoil,
against land-based pollution,
to cooperate in pollution incidents giving rise to situations of emergency,
to protect biological diversity,
against pollution due to transboundary movements of dangerous wastes and to eliminate them,
to monitor pollution,
to cooperate in science and technology
to apply environmental legislation, and
to facilitate public access to information and public participation.

Status 
Originally, fourteen states and the European Communities signed the Convention adopted in 1976. It came into effect on 12 February 1978. The amendments adopted in 1995 have yet to be ratified by Bosnia and Herzegovina. Parties are all countries with a Mediterranean shoreline as well as the European Union. NGOs with a stated interest and third-party governments are allowed observer status.

The convention is applicable to the 'Zone of the Mediterranean Sea'. This is defined as 'the maritime waters of the Mediterranean as such, with all its gulfs and tributary seas, bounded to the west by the Strait of Gibraltar and to the east by the Dardanelle Strait'. Parties are allowed to extend the application of the convention to the coastal areas within their own territory.

Treaties entered into by the European UnionJohannes Onsager Brecke (1 October 1877 – 28 April 1943) was a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the Conservative Party.

He was born in Drammen as a son of wholesaler Anders Brecke (1844–1922) and Caroline Onsager (1853–1888). In 1915 he married Fanny Lyche, a daughter of wholesaler Axel Lyche.

After finishing Kristiania Commerce School in 1895, he was hired in the company Harald Lyche & Co. Except for the year 1987 to 1900 when he took commercial training in England, France and Germany, he spent most of his career in this company. He was promoted to confidential clerk in 1914, and was chief executive officer from 1920 to 1922. From 1915 to 1922 he was also a director of Drammens Tidende og Buskerud Blad. From 1923 he was the co-owner of Harald Lyche & Co and Drammens Tidende og Buskerud Blad.

Brecke was a member of Drammen city council during several terms; 1910–1913, 1916–1919, 1925–1928 (executive committee) and 1931–1934. In the general elections of 1924 and 1927 he was elected as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway, representing the Market towns of Buskerud county. During the first term he served as first deputy deputy for Sven Adolf Svensen and Haakon Irgens; during the second term just for Svensen as the Conservatives lost one of their seats to Labour.

He chaired the employers' association Kortevaregrossisternes Landsforening from 1929 to 1935, was a board member of Solberg Spinderi from 1914 and supervisory council member of Forsikringsselskapet Norge. He died in April 1943.

78,427,2058-9-9 00:00:00,note_type6,"A diskless node (or diskless workstation) is a workstation or personal computer without disk drives, which employs network booting to load its operating system from a server. (A computer may also be said to act as a diskless node, if its disks are unused and network booting is used.)

Diskless nodes (or computers acting as such) are sometimes known as network computers or hybrid clients. Hybrid client may either just mean diskless node, or it may be used in a more particular sense to mean a diskless node which runs some, but not all, applications remotely, as in the thin client computing architecture.

Advantages of diskless nodes can include lower production cost, lower running costs, quieter operation, and manageability advantages (for example, centrally managed software installation).

In many universities and in some large organizations, PCs are used in a similar configuration, with some or all applications stored remotely but executed locally—again, for manageability reasons. However, these are not diskless nodes if they still boot from a local hard drive.

Distinction between diskless nodes and centralized computing

Diskless nodes process data, thus using their own CPU and RAM to run software, but do not store data persistently—that task is handed off to a server. This is distinct from thin clients, in which all significant processing happens remotely, on the server—the only software that runs on a thin client is the ""thin"" (i.e. relatively small and simple) client software, which handles simple input/output tasks to communicate with the user, such as drawing a dialog box on the display or waiting for user input.

A collective term encompassing both thin client computing, and its technological predecessor, text terminals (which are text-only), is centralized computing. Thin clients and text terminals can both require powerful central processing facilities in the servers, in order to perform all significant processing tasks for all of the clients.

Diskless nodes can be seen as a compromise between fat clients (such as ordinary personal computers) and centralized computing, using central storage for efficiency, but not requiring centralized processing, and making efficient use of the powerful processing power of even the slowest of contemporary CPUs, which would tend to sit idle for much of the time under the centralized computing model.

Principles of operation

The operating system (OS) for a diskless node is loaded from a server, using network booting. In some cases, removable storage may be used to initiate the bootstrap process, such as a USB flash drive, or other bootable media such as a floppy disk, CD or DVD. However, the firmware in many modern computers can be configured to locate a server and begin the bootup process automatically, without the need to insert bootable media.

For network auto-booting, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) or Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) network protocols are commonly used to find a server with files for booting the device. Standard full-size desktop PCs are able to be network-booted in this manner with an add-on network card that includes a UNDI boot ROM. Diskless network booting is commonly a built-in feature of desktop and laptop PCs intended for business use, since it can be used on an otherwise disk-booted standard desktop computer to remotely run diagnostics, to install software, or to apply a disk image to the local hard drive.

After the bootstrapping process has been initiated, as described above, bootstrapping will take place according to one of three main approaches.

In the first approach (used, for example, by the Linux Terminal Server Project), the kernel is loaded into memory and then the rest of the operating system is accessed via a network filesystem connection to the server. (A small RAM disk may be created to store temporary files locally.) This approach is sometimes called the ""NFS root"" technique when used with Linux or Unix client operating systems.
In the second approach, the kernel of the OS is loaded, and part of the system's memory is configured as a large RAM disk, and then the remainder of the OS image is fetched and loaded into the RAM disk. This is the implementation that Microsoft has chosen for its Windows XP Embedded remote boot feature.
In the third approach, disk operations are virtualized and are actually translated into a network protocol. The data that is usually stored in a disk drive are then stored in virtual disks files homed on a server. The disk operations such as requests to read/write disk sectors are translated into corresponding network requests and processed by a service or daemon running on the server side. This is the implementation that is used by Neoware Image Manager, Ardence, VHD and various ""boot over iSCSI"" products. This third approach differs from the first approach because what is remote is not a file system but actually a disk device (or raw device) and that the client OS is not aware that it is not running off a hard disk. This is why this approach is sometimes named ""Virtual Hard Disk"" or ""Network Virtual Disk"".

This third approach makes it easier to use client OS than having a complete disk image in RAM or using a read-only file system. In this approach, the system uses some ""write cache"" that stores every data that a diskless node has written. This write cache is usually a file, stored on a server (or on the client storage if any). It can also be a portion of the client RAM. This write cache can be persistent or volatile. When volatile, all the data that has been written by a specific client to the virtual disk are dismissed when said client is rebooted, and yet, user data can remain persistent if recorded in user (roaming) profiles or home folders (that are stored on remote servers). The two major commercial products (the one from Hewlett-Packard, and the other one from Citrix Systems) that allow the deployment of Diskless Nodes that can boot Microsoft Windows or Linux client OS use such write caches. The Citrix product cannot use persistent write cache, but VHD and HP product can.

Diskless Windows nodes 

Windows 3.x and Windows 95 OSR1 supported Remote Boot operations, from NetWare servers, Windows NT Servers and even DEC Pathworks servers.

Third party software Vendors such as Qualystem (acquired by Neoware), LanWorks (acquired by 3Com), Ardence (acquired by Citrix), APCT and Xtreamining Technology have developed and marketed software products aimed to remote-boot newer versions of the Windows product line: Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98 were supported by Qualystem and Lanworks, Windows NT was supported by APCT and Ardence (called VenturCom at that time), and Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/Windows 7 are supported by Hewlett Packard (which acquired Neoware which had previously acquired Qualystem) and Citrix Systems (which acquired Ardence).

Comparison with fat clients

Software installation and maintenance

With essentially a single OS image for an array of machines (with perhaps some customizations for differences in hardware configurations among the nodes), installing software and maintaining installed software can be more efficient. Furthermore, any system changes made during operation (due to user action, worms, viruses, etc.) can be either wiped out when the power is removed (if the image is copied to a local RAM disk) such as Windows XP Embedded remote boot or prohibited entirely (if the image is a network filesystem). This allows use in public access areas (such as libraries) or in schools etc., where users might wish to experiment or attempt to ""hack"" the system.

However, it is not necessary to implement network booting to achieve either of the above advantages - ordinary PCs (with the help of appropriate software) can be configured to download and reinstall their operating systems on (e.g.) a nightly basis, with extra work compared to using shared disk image that diskless nodes boot off.

Modern diskless nodes can share the very same disk image, using a 1:N relationship (1 disk image used simultaneously by N diskless nodes). This makes it very easy to install and maintain software applications: The administrator needs to install or maintain the application only once, and the clients can get the new application as soon as they boot off the updated image. Disk image sharing is made possible because they use the write cache: No client competes for any writing in a shared disk image, because each client writes to its own cache.

All the modern diskless nodes systems can also use a 1:1 Client-to-DiskImage relationship, where one client ""owns"" one disk image and writes directly into said disk image. No write cache is used then.

Making a modification in a shared disk image is usually made this way:

The administrator makes a copy of the shared disk image that he/she wants to update (this can be done easily because the disk image file is opened only for reading)
The administrator boots a diskless node in 1:1 mode (unshared mode) from the copy of the disk image he/she just made
The administrator makes any modification to the disk image (for instance install a new software application, apply patches or hotfixes)
The administrator shutdowns the diskless node that was using the disk image in 1:1 mode
The administrator shares the modified disk image
The diskless nodes use the shared disk image (1:N) as soon as they are rebooted.

Centralized storage

The use of central disk storage also makes more efficient use of disk storage. This can cut storage costs, freeing up capital to invest in more reliable, modern storage technologies, such as RAID arrays which support redundant operation, and storage area networks which allow hot-adding of storage without any interruption. Further, it means that losses of disk drives to mechanical or electrical failure—which are statistically highly probable events over a timeframe of years, with a large number of disks involved—are often both less likely to happen (because there are typically fewer disk drives that can fail) and less likely to cause interruption (because they would likely be part of RAID arrays). This also means that the nodes themselves are less likely to have hardware failures than fat clients.

Diskless nodes share these advantages with thin clients.

Performance of centralized storage

However, this storage efficiency can come at a price. As often happens in computing, increased storage efficiency sometimes comes at the price of decreased performance.

Large numbers of nodes making demands on the same server simultaneously can slow down everyone's experience. However, this can be mitigated by installing large amounts of RAM on the server (which speeds up read operations by improving caching performance), by adding more servers (which distributes the I/O workload), or by adding more disks to a RAID array (which distributes the physical I/O workload). In any case this is also a problem which can affect any client-server network to some extent, since, of course, fat clients also use servers to store user data.

Indeed, user data may be much more significant in size and may be accessed far more frequently than operating systems and programs in some environments, so moving to a diskless model will not necessarily cause a noticeable degradation in performance.

Greater network bandwidth (i.e. capacity) will also be used in a diskless model, compared to a fat client model. This does not necessarily mean that a higher capacity network infrastructure will need to be installed—it could simply mean that a higher proportion of the existing network capacity will be used.

Finally, the combination of network data transfer latencies (physically transferring the data over the network) and contention latencies (waiting for the server to process other nodes' requests before yours) can lead to an unacceptable degradation in performance compared to using local drives, depending on the nature of the application and the capacity of the network infrastructure and the server.

Other advantages

Another example of a situation where a diskless node would be useful is in a possibly hazardous environment where computers are likely to be damaged or destroyed, thus making the need for inexpensive nodes, and minimal hardware a benefit. Again, thin clients can also be used here.

Diskless machines may also consume little power and make little noise, which implies potential environmental benefits and makes them ideal for some computer cluster applications.

Comparison with thin clients

Major corporations tend to instead implement thin clients (using Microsoft Windows Terminal Server or other such software), since much lower specification hardware can be used for the client (which essentially acts as a simple ""window"" into the central server which is actually running the users operating system as a login session). Of course, diskless nodes can also be used as thin clients. Moreover, thin client computers are increasing in power to the point where they are becoming suitable as fully-fledged diskless workstations for some applications.

Both thin client and diskless node architectures employ diskless clients which have advantages over fat clients (see above), but differ with regard to the location of processing.

Advantages of diskless nodes over thin clients
Distributed load The processing load of diskless nodes is distributed. Each user gets its own processing isolated environment, barely affecting other users in the network, as long as their workload is not filesystem-intensive. Thin clients rely on the central server for the processing and thus require a fast server. When the central server is busy and slow, both kinds of clients will be affected, but thin clients will be slowed completely, whereas diskless nodes will only be slowed when accessing data on the server.
Better multimedia performance. Diskless nodes have advantages over thin clients in multimedia-rich applications that would be bandwidth intensive if fully served. For example, diskless nodes are well suited for video gaming because the rendering is local, lowering the latency.
Peripheral support Diskless nodes are typically ordinary personal computers or workstations with no hard drives supplied, which means the usual large variety of peripherals can be added. By contrast, thin clients are typically very small, sealed boxes with no possibility for internal expansion, and limited or non-existent possibility for external expansion. Even if e.g. a USB device can be physically attached to a thin client, the thin client software might not support peripherals beyond the basic input and output devices - for example, it may not be compatible with graphics tablets, digital cameras or scanners.

Advantages of thin clients over diskless nodes
The hardware is cheaper on thin clients, since processing requirements on the client are minimal, and 3D acceleration and elaborate audio support are not usually provided. Of course, a diskless node can also be purchased with a cheap CPU and minimal multimedia support, if suitable. Thus, cost savings may be smaller than they first appear for some organizations. However, many large organizations habitually buy hardware with a higher than necessary specification to meet the needs of particular applications and uses, or to ensure future proofing (see next point). There are also less ""rational"" reasons for overspecifying hardware which quite often come into play: departments wastefully using up budgets in order to retain their current budget levels for next year; and uncertainty about the future, or lack of technical knowledge, or lack of care and attention, when choosing PC specifications. Taking all these factors into account, thin clients may bring the most substantial savings, as only the servers are likely to be substantially ""gold-plated"" and/or ""future-proofed"" in the thin client model.
Future proofing is not much of an issue for thin clients, which are likely to remain useful for the entirety of their replacement cycle - one to four years, or even longer - as the burden is on the servers. There are issues when it comes to diskless nodes, as the processing load is potentially much higher, thus meaning more consideration is required when purchasing. Thin client networks may require significantly more powerful servers in the future, whereas a diskless nodes network may in future need a server upgrade, a client upgrade, or both.
Thin client networks have less network bandwidth consumption potentially, since much data is simply read by the server and processed there, and only transferred to the client in small pieces, as and when needed for display. Also, transferring graphical data to the display is usually more suited for efficient data compression and optimisation technologies (see e.g. NX technology) than transferring arbitrary programs, or user data. In many typical application scenarios, both total bandwidth consumption and ""burst"" consumption would be expected to be less for an efficient thin client, than for a diskless node.

The play was performed on Broadway in 1959.

Plot
In an English household, the father dreams of giving up his job selling insurance to run an apple orchard, the mother dreams of him giving up his dreams, and the two children have problems of their own .

Adaptations
The play was adapted for British television in 1963.

1963 Australian TV adaptation

It was filmed for Australian TV in 1963, directed by Colin Dean and starring Grant Taylor, Peter Adams, Don Pascoe, Elizabeth Ferris, Margo Lee, Frank Taylor and Rosalind Seagrave.

It was the first drama to be simultaneously presented in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne via coaxial cable.

Plot
A man abandons his life as a clerk to start an orchard. His dreams of fulfilment are linked to his memories of growing up in Somerset. 

His wife decides to leave him.

Production
The production was filmed in Sydney. 

At the time Grant Taylor was appearing on stage with Googie Withers in Woman in a Dressing Gown. 

Elizabeth Ferris who made her acting debut was a diving champion whose name was linked romantically to Murray Rose.

Reception
The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought ""Grant Taylor was well in command"" of his role but that Colin Dean's production ""was rather too crowded.""

Val Marshall of the Sunday edition of the same paper called it ""a first rate production"" in which Taylor and Lee were ""brilliant"".

The Bulletin wrote that ""Given a stronger plot, livelier dialogue,   less   stagey   sets,   more imaginative  cameras, some television   actors,   and  better   make-up,   it   could   have   been   a  good   play.   Lacking   them,   it   was   still tolerable,   because   the   viewer   could   feel  that   at   least   everyone   was   trying,   and that   is   not   a   bad   beginning   for   ABC  drama   production   in   1963.""

1960 in German sportThe Pixie Grape is a new type of Vitis vinifera cultivar. The Pixie is a natural dwarf grapevine that is derived from the periclinal L1/L2 chimera Pinot Meunier. These dwarf grapevines tend to have short internodes and prefer to grow flowers instead of  tendrils. They grow from 1 foot to 2 feet in height and produce clusters with a size on average of 4 inches. It is simple to cultivate in greenhouses and grows year round. Its purpose was to create an easy tool with which to conduct grapevine research.  The grape was developed by grape rootstock breeder Dr. Peter Cousins of the USDA.

Description

Flowering
The Pixie is a unique grape in that its size is the most important part of its genotype and phenotype. It usually only grows up to about 2 feet in height and does not usually span out in horizontal growth. Internodes on a Pixie are about 25% the length of the Pinot Meunier chimeras length. Flowering is constant on a vine that is still alive and it is not uncommon to view all types of flowering from buds all the way up to ripe fruit just on one vine. Pixies do not grow tendrils however, instead they grow Inflorescences(group or cluster of flowers).

Fruit
Fruit can be obtained all year round from the Pixie. The Pixie's fruit is a black fruited grape with seeds in it. Cluster length usually maxes out at 10 cm in length and the vines that are not regularly thinned tend to grow a lot of fruit and in turn slow growth and reduce the number of flowers produced. Seeds can be obtained and there have been known results of seedlings growing and showing flowers. However, due to a reduced sensitivity to gibberellins a Gibberellic Acid treatment is necessary when undergoing seed germination.

Propagation
The Propagation process started with the Pinot Meunier chimera. Unopened flower buds were taken and the anthers were isolated on a medium to create embryogenic callus cultures. Then they were grown into plants where they tissue cultured acclimated to soil and then moved to a greenhouse. Grown under all day artificial light. Once grown pollen was obtained where it was cultured on vines from the vineyard. Seeds were then treated with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide for 24 hrs, 1000 ppm GA3 for one day, after that was three months of moist stratification, then treated with 5000 ppm GA3 for one day before being placed in an incubator at 29.3 °C. These seeds were then treated normally grown and grew into mature plants.

Uses
The primary use of the Pixie is for research. The intent of scientists when propagating and obtaining this dwarf was to provide a grapevine that was suited to expedite viticulture and other areas of grapevine research. These grapevines are vastly reduced in size so they can easily be grown in a pot in the greenhouse. This allows for year-round growth and flowering which in turn provides researchers to study flowering continuously throughout the year. It is also believed that the Pixies may be used to speed up backcrossing or pseudobackcrossing. Teaching and studying grape growth, development and morphology at any times of the year is made possible by being able to obtain grapes of any age at any time of the year no matter the weather outside because it is grown in a protected environment. Interactions with diseases can also be studied more in depth and also berry development. Not having to cope with a 2–3-month window in the summer to obtain your data, you can now have access to it year around. With this plant you can study any topic from genetics to pathology to physiology all year round and obtain a plethora of more information.

 in Thai tennisQuintessenz Leipzig Flute Ensemble is a flute quintet from Leipzig, Germany. Its members are five musicians of the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the MDR Symphony Orchestra, and the Staatskapelle Halle. The group play music from every musical epoch and nearly every style.

History 

Quintessenz Leipzig Flute Ensemble was founded in 1996. The British a cappella-band King’s Singers, and the Bamboozles, a flute quintet of five students of Trevor Wye, served as examples. The idea of an ensemble that consisted of musicians who played the same instruments in different voices excited the five flutists from Leipzig.

At first Quintessenz met in private to play Jazz. As they all are trained as classical and not as jazz flutists they soon developed a characteristic sound. From the beginning everything they played had their classical education as basis.

Out of lack of literature for flute quintets Quintessenz began to arrange their own musical pieces. For that they did not only use music for quintets of different kinds but also adapted symphonic pieces, piano literature, or completely different music. Thus they began to compile their own programmes.

In 1999 Quintessenz recorded their first CD, followed by three more. 2006 the ensemble were invited by Trevor Wye to the flute festival of the British Flute Society in Manchester. Since then they performed at various international festivals, inter alia in New York City in August 2009, hosted by the National Flute Association of the United States.

A few years ago Quintessenz started to focus on the support of young flutists. In cooperation with the regional music council () and the Jeunesses Musicales Germany they hosted several workshops for flute chamber-music.

Programs 

Because of their very own style of music the Quintessenz programmes also have a special character. There is always a main topic or theme the music can be subordinated to. This theme can either be music or composer related (Mozartimento), but also country (America!) or literature related (Tour de France). In addition to that Quintessenz have several special programmes that combine music and poetry (Hymn to fish, All those birds). For those they are assisted by professional stage actors who recite poems to the respective topic.

A special form of these programmes is the ""musical promenade"". The audience is invited to walk through the landscape together with “Quintessenz” playing music at different places. 
Additional programmes are for example ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" – the programme for the Mendelssohn year 2009. Parts of the music of the Midsummer Night's Dream are the frame, replenished with pieces about summer, night, and elves.

It has an enrollment of 2,086 undergraduates and 2,193 graduate students,. In 2009, 257 bachelor's degrees, 92 master's degrees and 29 doctoral degrees were conferred.

History

The college was founded in 1909, but engineering work started five years before that under the School of Applied Science. By 1908 formal programs had been established in electrical, civil and mechanical engineering under the direction of the school's first dean, James Felgar, who would lead the soon to be created college for 28 years. The college's first spike in enrollment came in the 1930s, when demand for natural gas and oil led to the creation of programs in geological engineering and petroleum engineering. Until the 1970s, engineering students could be identified by the slide rules which were carried in a leather case on their belts.

The college's main offices are currently located on the bottom floor of Felgar Hall, which also houses the main offices for the mechanical and aerospace engineering department. The Engineering Laboratory building is also home to many offices for mechanical and aerospace engineering. Carson Engineering Center hosts many civil and industrial engineering offices as well. The first three floors of the Sarkeys Energy Center are home to the school of chemical engineering. In recent years, the college of engineering has rapidly expanded beyond these buildings as to the recently constructed Devon Energy Hall, for electrical and computer engineering, and the ExxonMobil Lawrence G. Rawl Engineering Practice Facility, which provides students and engineering organizations large scale work space. Four of these buildings (Carson, Felgar, Devon and the Practice Facility) create the ""engineering quad"" on the northeast section of OU's main campus. Additionally, many graduate level classes and research labs are located Stephenson Research Center located on Norman's south campus.

Between 1998 and 2002, the college had negotiated dozens of licenses and patent applications, marketed more than 55 inventions and helped with the formation of 12 start-up companies.

In 2010 the college celebrated its centennial with a variety of events, including a symposium with presentations from several prominent alumni, as well as a keynote address by renowned humanitarian and Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson.

Traditions

Irish Heritage
St. Patrick, who among other things is the patron saint of engineers, has long been the unofficial mascot of the College of Engineering. Paintings of shamrocks can be found in many of the engineering buildings, and the events celebrating National Engineers Week (U.S.) often have an Irish theme.

Loyal Knights of Old Trusty
The Loyal Knights of Old Trusty is a secret organization founded at the University of Oklahoma in 1920. That year a small group of engineers banded together and formed this secret order to uphold the traditions of the College of Engineering and to pay homage to the Patron Saint of Engineers, Saint Patrick. During this time it has served the College of Engineering in every possible way, but above all by keeping alive its cherished traditions. Until they unhood themselves at the ""fireout""  event during Engineers' Week each year, members are known only by their number and are only seen on campus wearing black hooded robes bearing their respective number. These students who wear the black robes are seldom seen but they represent an active and old tradition of the university. There are LKOT signs all around the campus at the entrances to university buildings and university houses.

Rivalry
The College of Engineering has a longstanding rivalry with the OU College of Law. Statues of owls in the facade of Monnet Hall, the former home of the law students, have been repeatedly painted green by engineering students, a practice that has been  discontinued in recent years. For example, the owl statues on the law college's new building were painted green during E-Week of 2003, and a large banner was glued to the front of the building, causing several thousand dollars in damage.

Academic programs
The college grants degrees at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels. Engineering fields covered at the college include:
Aerospace Engineering
Architectural Engineering
Bioengineering
Biomedical Engineering
Chemical Engineering (standard, premedical/biomedical, and biotechnology)

He was married to Gangabai Sathe on 18 April 1763 before his eighth birthday. He was very close to Parvatibai, the widow of Sadashivrao, who took him under her care to lessen her sorrows after her husband's death. His eldest brother Vishwasrao, heir to the title of the Peshwa, died in the Battle of Panipat in 1761 along with Sadashivrao. His father died a few months later and his elder brother Madhavrao took over as Peshwa.

He accompanied his brother Peshwa Madhavrao in his expeditions to Carnatic on two occasions, once in 1765 and later in 1769. He received a wound in his wrist at the storming of fort Nijagal at the end of April 1770. In last one or two years of his brother's reign, he was placed in the care of the Maratha minister Sakharam Bapu in order to train him in his administrative work. His behaviour and performance of his duties always failed to impress his brother Madhavrao who expressed great fears about his future.

Ascension 
Before his death, Peshwa Madhavrao conducted a court session in which the issue of ascension was discussed at length and at the end of which, in the presence of the family deity, he nominated his younger brother Narayanrao as the next Peshwa. He counselled Naraynrao to conduct his administration by the advice of Sakharam Bapu and Nana Padnavis. Raghunathrao, the uncle of both Madhavrao and Narayanrao, didn't have the courage to openly oppose the nomination of Narayanrao in front of the dying Peshwa and so he apparently acquiesced to the arrangement. The Peshwa had also ordered in writing that Raghunathrao was to continue his confinement so as to prevent him from engaging in mischief. Raghunathrao attempted an escape shortly before the Peshwa's death but was immediately caught and put back into confinement.

Peshwa Madhavrao finally died on 18 November 1772. His funeral rites were conducted at Theur and the court returned to Pune on 2 December. Narayanrao prepared to set off for Satara in order to receive his robes from Chhatrapati Rajaram II. Before he could leave, his uncle Raghunathrao demanded to accompany him to Satara unless he was granted an independent fief of 25 lakhs annually for him and his family. But Raghunathrao was persuaded to give up his demands. And so Narayanrao went to Satara and received his robes from Rajaram II on 13 December. At the same time, Sakharam Bapu took his role as Karbhari (""Chief Administrator"") and other officials confirmed their respective posts.

Reign

Alienation of various groups

Gardis 
The Peshwas employed Gardi soldiers for police duty around the palace and the city of Pune. The Gardis were less than 5000 strong and were mostly composed of North Indians, Pathans, Ethiopians, Arabs, Rajputs and Purbiyas. Their monthly salary ranged somewhere between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15. According to French military leader and administrator Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, the Gardis saw their role in purely commercial terms and had no personal attachment to their employer. The new Peshwa Narayanrao inherited an empty treasury from his brother. Madhavrao had lost all the wealth he had accumulated over the years in paying off the empire's debts and had failed to bring funds in the last few years of life due to his illness. On top of that, with Ibrahim Khan Gardi and Marquis de Bussy gone, the Gardis no longer had a overarching leader to keep them disciplined. The unpaid and disorganised Gardis had now become a liability for the Marathas but neither Peshwa nor his advisors paid much attention to the pressing issue.

Prabhus 

The Prabhus were an influential community in the Maratha empire. They claimed to be belonging to the Kshatriya (""warrior"") caste which gave them the right to perform religious functions through the use of Vedic chants. A dispute over their caste status had occurred in the late 17th century but it was virtually resolved after the founder of the Maratha empire Shivaji and his confidential secretary Balaji Avji Chitnis, a Prabhus by caste, performed the sacred thread ceremony of their sons at the same time by using Vedic chants under the direction of the celebrated Brahmin scholar Gaga Bhatt. This created a precedent that allowed the Prabhus to hold on to their Kshatriya status without interference from orthodox Brahmins. But then Narayanrao decided to take up the cause of the orthodoxy and, likely under the impression from Nana Phadnavis, reduced their caste status from that of Kshatriya (""warrior"") to that of Shudra (""servant""). Prominent leaders of the Prabhu community were called together and under severe torture, including starvation, forced to give up their caste status. They were compelled to sign an agreement of nine specific articles, according to which they would give up Kshatriya status and accept Shudra status. This action on the part of Narayanrao lost him the support of an influential community who later supported Raghunathrao.

Sakharam Bapu 
Sakharam Bapu's policy which favoured compromise over radicalism was at odds with the rash and irritable behaviour of Narayanrao. The differences between the two quickly came to light during the appointment of the governorship of Vasai. The position had previously been held for a long time by a soldier and diplomat named Visajipant Lele. Sakharam Bapu held him in high regard because he had faithfully served him in several awkward situations that required mutual support. But Visajipant Lele was a corrupt official whose ill deeds were long known to Madhavrao. During the last days of his tenure, Madhavrao dismissed Visajipanth Lele after he misappropriated government property worth 20 lakhs. So when Narayanrao became Peshwa, Visajipanth Lele requested the new Peshwa to reappoint him as the Governor of Vasai. His request was supported by Sakharam Bapu but Narayanrao rejected Bapu's advise and appointed Trimbak Vinayak instead.

Narayanrao and Sakharam Bapu also disagreed on the issue of the Patwardhan Sardars. The Patwardhan Sardars had gained enormous power through their loyal service to the late Peshwa which irked Sakharam Bapu and Raghunathrao who took certain steps to lower their prestige, much to the displeasure of Narayanrao. Since the differences between Narayanrao and Sakharam Bapu were growing they decide to consult the opinions of Gopikabai, the widow of Balaji Rao and the eldest member of the family. And so Narayanrao, Sakharam Bapu and Vamanrao Patwardhan, the leading of the Patwardhan family, repaired to Gangapur in the middle of March 1773 to meet ask for her advise. They spent a few days in frank discussion but couldn't arrive at any definite resolution.

Other Maratha officials 
The courtiers at Pune had very negative opinions of the new Peshwa whom they described as impatient, irritable, facetious, gullible and immature person who refused to follow the guidance of Sakharam Bapu. Narayanrao had started imitating the manners and behaviour of his elder brother Madhavrao and had openly disrespected Sakharam Bapu and other elderly officials on several occasions. Nana Phadnavis kept himself aloof due to lack of confidence shown towards him. Unlike his senior colleague Sakharam Bapu, he only involved himself with the administration when absolutely necessary. This explains why Nana Phadnavis did not notice the talks of intrigues and plots taking place in the city. Moroba Phadnavis was another member of the executive government who shared the attitutde of indifference towards the Peshwa. The same was true for the Maratha general Haripant Phadke.

Confinement of Raghunathrao

First attempt to escape 
Narayanrao's relationship with his uncle Raghunathrao was cordial at the beginning. When Raghunathrao's daughter Durgabai was about to get married, Narayanrao made the arrangements for the marriage which took place on 7 February 1773. But later when Narayanrao was at Nashik, Raghunathrao tried to take advantage of the Peshwa's absence and plotted his escape. Raghunathrao began to enlist his own troops and wrote to Haidar Ali for support. Naro Appaji, the Maratha officer inchage for law and order in Pune, heightened the security around Raghunathrao by placing guards to watch all the exits of the palace and the city. Raghunathrao pitched his tents outside and declared that he was going on an expedition.

As soon as this news reached Narayanrao he returned to Pune and found Raghunathrao in his tents. He brought him back to the palace on 11 April 1773 and placed additional guards to prevent his escape. This further strained the relationship between Narayanrao and Raghunathrao. In July 1773, Raghunathrao become so exasperated with the restrictions imposed on him that he threatened to starve himself, his wife and his adopted son to death. Narayanrao failed to sooth things over by compromise. He had no advisors whom he could trust upon at this point.

Second attempt to escape 
Two agents from Nagpur had been dispatched to Pune to request the Peshwa's confirmation for making Raghuji Bhonsle, the son of Mudhoji Bhonsle, the ruler of Nagpur in order to put the succession dispute between Mudhoji and his brother Sabaji to an end. But when the two agents arrived at Pune in the summer of 1773 and discovered the tensions between Narayanrao and Raghunathrao, they realised they had much to benefit from the chaos. At the same time Narayanrao continued supporting the claim of Sabaji and sent armed reinforcements under Khanderao Darekar to support him against his brother. This caught the ire of Mudhoji who vaguely told his agents to do whatever they deemed necessary for accomplishing their mission by supporting Raghunathrao's power.

But the agents needed to have a discussion with Raghunathrao before they could formulate a plan. Raghunathrao was in strict confinement at the time and so they approached Sakharam Hari Gupte, a strong partisan of Raghunathrao who had also been incensed by the Peshwa's decision to reduce the caste status of his community. They manage to obtain a secret meeting with Raghunathrao in which they hatch a plan which involved seizing Narayanrao and placing Raghunathrao on the throne. This would require for Raghunathrao to be free and organise an armed foce. In August 1773, during night time, Raghunathrao tried to escape using the help of Lakshman Kashi. But Raghunathrao was caught and taken into custody while Lakshman Kashi managed to escape and fled from Pune.

When news of Raghunathrao's attempted escape reached Narayanrao he made the terms of uncle's confinement harsher. Raghunathrao was no longer allowed to leave his room, all his essentials were delivered to him and his lavish lifestyle was curtailed. As part of his prayer, Raghunathrao would stand in the open and gaze at the sun, but he was now barred from performing it which made him furious. Although the relationship between Madhavrao and Raghunathrao, the former carefully avoided exasperating his uncle beyond a certain limit and skillfully employed his uncle's partisans so as to prevent any action against him. But Narayanrao lacked his elder brother's foresight and so his dissidents were able to find a common goal in supporting his uncle.

Third attempt to escape 
Raghunathrao was also able to find the finding the sympathy of Appaji Ram, the ambassador of Haidar Ali at Pune, who managed to persuade his ruler to support Raghunathrao's cause. When Narayan found out about his uncle's plan to escape by enlisting the support Haidar Ali, he confined him in his palace and allowed neither his friends to visit him nor his servants to attend to him. His uncle, whether through exasperation or shrewdness, declared that he would starve himself to death so that his murder would be attributed to his nephew. For the next eighteen days, he consumed nothing except for two ounces of deer milk each day. When he was finally exhaused due to pangs of hunger, his nephew somewhat relented by promising him a district and five castles and a jagir of Rs. 12 lakh per annum, provided some of the great chieftains would become surety for his future conduct.

Foreign policy

Resettlement of old allies 
The Marathas led by Mahadji Shinde had recaptured Delhi in 1771. Mahadji Shinde and other Marathas chiefs were later occupied in looking after the affairs of Delhi and collecting revenues from other North Indian districts. Ghazi-uddin Imad-ul-mulk, an ally of the Marathas, was anxious to be reinstalled as the Wazir of the Mughal Empire as he had once been. The Mughal emperor Shah Alam II bitterly hated Ghazi-uddin for he murdering his father and would not give him any help. Meanwhile, Ghazi-uddin had been reduced to the status of a vagabond and so he went to Pune in December 1772 to make his case in front of the new Peshwa. In recognition of the services he had rendered onto the Marathas so far, and likely because of a promise made to him by Narayanrao, Nana Padnavis gave Ghazi-uddin a small provision in Bundelkhand. The previous Nawab of Bengal Mir Qasim was another important friend of the Marathas and expected  a similar compensation for his services but it was beyond the power of the Peshwa to satisfy him.

British naval attack 

In April 1772, as Madhavrao was on his death bed, the President of Bombay Council received orders from the Home authorities to try and acquire from the Maratha certain places such as Salsette, Vasai, Elephanta, Karanja and others islands in the vicinity of Mumbai and to station a British agent in Pune in order to gain that object. British official Thomas Mostyn was chosen for the task as he was already familiar with the Pune court, having led the British mission of 1767.  He arrived in Pune on 13 October 1772 and spent the next two years keenly watching the events unfold and advising the Bombay Council to take the necessary steps for the acquisition of those place.

Soon after the death of Madhavrao and ascension to the Maratha throne of his ostensibly weaker brother Narayanrao, the British navy sensing a opportunity started wanton aggression against Maratha posts of Thane, Vasai, Vijaydurg and Ratnagiri on the west coast. But Narayanrao took immediate action by appointing Trimbak Vinayak as the Sar-Subah of Vasai and the Konkan, and dispatched him with necessary funds to counter the British efforts. Trimbak Vinayak and the Maratha naval officer Dhulap of Vijaydurg together successfully repelled the British attack. But Mostyn remained at Pune watching and waiting for another opportunity.

Nagpur succession crisis 
The death of the ruler of Nagpur Janoji Bhonsle in May 1772 set off a succession dispute within his family and led to a civil war between his sons Mudhoji and Sabaji. The disputed created ruptures at the Court of Pune as Sakharam Bapu and Raghunathrao supported Mudhoji while Narayanrao, Nana Phadnavis and others supported Sabaji. Sabaji also gained the support of Nizam Ali Khan and fought some battles against him brother whose result turned out to be indecisive. The brothers finally reached an agreement, according to which Mudhoji's son Raghuji was to be made the ruler of Nagpur. The arrangement had to be approved by the Peshwa, and so two agents, Vyankatrao Kashi Gupte and his brother Lakshman, were sent to Pune in order to acquire the robes for Raghuji.

The agents sent to Pune belonged to the Prabhu caste whose members were cross with Narayanrao who, likely under the impression from Nana Phadnavis, had reduced their caste status from that of Kshatriya (""warrior"") to that of Shudra (""servant""). Prominent leaders of the Prabhu community were called together and under severe torture, including starvation, forced to give up their caste status. This action on the part of Narayanrao lost him the support of an influential community who later supported Raghunathrao. The two agents then tried to help Raghunathrao escape from his confinement. The actions of the agents exasperated and disgusted the Peshwa who on 16 August 1773 issued orders recognising Sabaji as the rightful ruler of Nagpur and commanded the agents to go back to Nagpur along with the third agent Bhavani Shivam who had just arrived.

Assassination

Preparations 
The period between 16 and 30 August witnessed an unprecedented number of secret talks and concealed discussions taking place among the various partisans of Raghunathrao, but as this had been a regular occurrence at the palace, no responsible official paid any serious attention to them. Since Raghunathrao could not leave his confinement, the preparations for the plot were carried out by Tujali Pawar, an influential personal servant of Raghunathrao and his wife Anandibai. Tujali additionally felt he had been wronged by Narayanrao and possibly Madhavrao, and regardless of whether this supposed offense was real or not, it motivated him to play an integral part in the plot. While the previous plan involved simply capturing Narayanrao, the new plan involved his murder and was partly based on the assumption that Sakharam Bapu would remain neutral with regards to the plot.

The Ganapati festival was held for a period of ten days between 21 and 31 August. The festival was a holiday for the administration and all the officials and staff were occupied with various aspects of the festival such as the worship in the morning and evening, Vedic recitation, music, dance, durbars, feasts and processions. Tulaji met with the Gardi leaders during the Ganesh festival to inform them of the plot being hatched. Since he was an old servant he couldn't be abruptly dismissed even if suspected of a conspiracy and had ready access to his master and his wife in order to plan out various parts of the plot. Sumersinh was the Gardi officer who had been appointed by Narayanrao to be incharge of his uncle and hence had free access to him. He was won over by Tulaji, along with Muhammad Yusuf, Kharagsinh and Bahadur Khan, each of them had about a thousand soldiers working under them. They were promised to be given a cash reward of Rs. 3 lakh if they successfully executed the plot. A written order was produced by Raghunathrao for these four chiefs, ordering them to ""seize"" the Peshwa. The written order might have been altered before being delivered to the Gardi chiefs and the word ""seize"" might've been replaced with the word ""slay"" but the identity of the person who did this has remained a mystery. Meanwhile, the Gardis chiefs were aware that the Peshwa could be slain if he were to offer armed resistance. When they conveyed these thoughts to Raghunathrao, he absolved them of any responsibility for the possible murder.

Execution 

Raghuji Angre of Kolaba had arrived in Pune to meet with the Peshwa and asked him to make a return visit on 30 August. And so Narayanrao along with Haripant Phadke rode to Angre's residence at around ten in the morning. Raghuji told Narayanrao during their conversational about the troubling rumours he had heard and warned him to be on his guard against danger to his life. After the meeting with Raghuji, Narayanrao and Phadke went to the Parvati temple to have their breakfast along with some guests who had been invited there. After the meal, the Peshwa and Haripant went back to the palace. Narayanrao told Haripant what he had heard from Raghuji and asked him to take the necessary steps to prevent any mischief. Haripant assured him that he would take care of the matter but first he had to attend to a mid-day meal with a friend. The Peshwa retired to his room in the palace. Meanwhile, Tujali found out that the plot had been leaked and told the Gardi chiefs to immediately execute the plan or else everything could be ruined.

At around one o'clock in the afternoon, five hundred soldiers led by the Gardi chiefs cut down the men guarding the hind gate and immediately rushed into the palace. They demanded payment of their long delayed salaries. The clerks and servants admonished the soldiers for the commotion and told them that their grievances would be listened to in the office. The soldiers responded by attacking the clerks; when one of them took shelter behind a cow, that used to be on the premises at all times for fresh milk, the soldiers cut down the animal and the man hiding behind it. They closed the front gate and proceeded to the Peshwa's room upstairs with their swords drawn and deafening shouts. The palace was packed with cries of horror and grief by the inmates but there was nothing they could do to stop the attack.

Narayanrao was entirely unarmed at this time and in fear of his life he escaped through the back door to the apartment of his aunt Parvitabai, with whom he had a very close relationship as she had practically raised him since he was an infant. Parvatibai told him to go to his uncle as he could save his life. Narayanrao ran to his uncle who was performing his worship and held on to him, begging to be saved and even offering to make him Peshwa in exchange for being spared by the Gardi soldiers. Meanwhile, Tulaji and Sumersinh who had closely followed Narayanrao arrived there and pulled him away from his uncle. Tulaji violently seized Narayanrao and Sumersinh hacked him to pieces. Narayanrao's servant Chapaji Tilekar fell upon his master's body to save him with some maids and they were all cruelly cut down. A little later Naroba Naik, an old and trusted man on palace duty, came forth and berated Raghunathrao for allowing such deplorable actions and he too was slain by the Gardis. Within a period of half an hour, eleven people had been killed in the palace, seven of them were Brahmin, two Maratha servants, two maids, besides one cow, no less sacred a life in the heart of a Brahman city.

Aftermath

Reaction 
Upon hearing the news, Haripant Phadke hurriedly went to the palace with his troops and artillery but since he did not know what was happening inside he could not open fire on the structure. Many Maratha officials including Nana Phadnavis met at the Budhwar Police Station while others such as Bhavanrao Pratinidhi, Maloji Ghorpade and others went to the palace to obtain correct information of what had happened. The Gardis were guarding the premises of the palace and only allowed the Maratha officials to enter after laying down their arms. When they were permitted to meet Raghunathrao they found him lying on the courtyard of the groundfloor and by Gardi soldiers with their swords drawn out. In the meanwhile some of the other Gardis began hastily plundering the palace and were only pacifed due to the help of some city bankers.

It nearly midnight when Raghunathrao had been proclaimed as the ruler of the state by the Gardis and allowed to pick his officials that the Gardis allowed the dead bodies to be taken out and funeral rites to be performed. The mangled pieces of Narayanrao were collected in a bundle for cremation. Sakharam Bapu was overcome by grief since he couldn't fulfil the promise he had made to Madhavrao and his wife Ramabai to protect Narayanrao. He refused to take any part in the new administration and left the city. Nana Phadnavis also refused to join Raghunathrao's government and the latter had no liking for him. The horrifying and chaotic events at Pune presented the enemies of the Marathas with the moment they had been looking for all along. A wave of attacks had occurred throughout the country although no one took up arms against the capital of Pune itself. It was only during the time of the Dashera festival on 25 September that Raghunathrao began to address that threats that were posed by Nizam Ali and Haidar Ali.

Most people reluctantly accepted Raghunathrao's rule because there was no other male member of the Peshwa's family to take the reigns of power, but they were apprehensive at heart to submit to the rule of a person who killed his own nephew who was unarmed and who belonged to the same Brahmin caste. The mother of Narayanrao at Nashik was consumed with grief and sorrow when she learned about her son's death. Her eldest son and heir to the empire Vishwasrao had died at the Battle of Panipat in 1761, her second eldest son Madhavrao succumbed to disease and her youngest had been brutally murdered. She felt so overcome with grief that she gave up her comfortable life and went around begging for alms with a half coconut shell from door to door. She continued this practice for over an year and only regained her peace of mind when the ministers finally overthrew the murderer of her son and when his wife Gangabai gave birth to a new son.

Raghunathrao's short lived government 

Having failed to convince the senior and most highly competent ministers such as Sakharam Bapu and Nana Phadnavis to join his new administration, Raghunathrao had to begin his rule with the help of ministers Chinto Vithal and Moroba Phadnavis. The two Nagpur agents also continued supporting him. Raghunathrao sent one of them, Laksham Kashi with a letter of friendly terms to Mudhoji Bhonsle inviting him to Pune with all his forces. The other Nagpur agent Vyankatrao remained in Pune to help the new Peshwa manage the new administration. He sent Amritrao to Satara to procure the robes from Chhatrapati Rajaram II but there was a delay and the robes were finally obtained on 10 October 1773. He did not ceremoniously accept them in a durbar at Pune but rather at Alegaon near the river Bhima on the last day of October. He prepared his own seal and purposefully omitted Rajaram's name as being inauspicious.

During the Dashera festival occurring on the 25th of September 1773, apart from having to discuss the threaths posed by Haidar Ali and Nizam Ali, Raghunathrao also had to deal with the Gardi chiefs who virtually held all the power and whose only goal was to get as much money from him as possible. He appointed Bhavanrao Pratinidhi as his agent for settling the matter with the Gardi chiefs. Bhavanrao Pratinidhi got rid of the Gardi chiefs from the palace by paying them the stipulated five lakh rupees and an additional amount of three lakh rupees in lieu of the three forts they wanted as their safe resort. During the negotiations, the Gardis had threatened to depose Raghunathrao and install Ali Bahadur (grandson of Peshwa Baji Rao) as the peshwa if their payments were made. They also demanded and were given a written order that Raghunathrao would protect them under all circumstances.

Hence Raghunathrao now had no strong supporters except second rate men such as the Gardi chiefs, and Sakharam Hari, Sadashiv Ramchandra, Vyankatrao Kashi, Abaji Mahadev, Tulaji Pawar, Moroba Phadnavis, Maloji Ghorpade, Govindrao Gaikwad, Manaji Phadke and Mudhoji Bhonsle. Gangadhar Yeshwant, an important partisan of Raghunathrao, died on 20 February 1774 and this considerably weakened his party. But at least his monetary troubles were relieved after Visaji Krishna arrived in Pune and brought with him, under orders from the previous Peshwa, a treasure of 22 lakh rupees and which Raghunathrao greedily sized.

Legal consequences 
Ram Shastri, the Nyayadhish (""Chief Justice"") of the Maratha empire, likely began looking into the killing of Narayanrao immediately after the incident despite Raghunathrao's opposition. The investigation lasted for around six weeks and decisions were made in accordance with established judicial practices. Shastri found Raghunathrao as the main culprit and in addition about fifty persons more or less responsible for the murder (forty nine males and one female servant). Of these forty nine men, thirteen were Gardis (eight Hindus and five Muslims), twenty six were Brahmin, three were Prabhu and seven were Marathas. The twenty six Brahmins were essentially clerks who acted as agents in planning and executing the details of the plan. Vyankatrao Kashi, his brother Laxman and Sakharam Hari Gupte were the three Prabhus who were declared to have played a prominent role in the plot. When Shastri approached Raghunathrao, the latter downplayed the murder as a private, personal affair and asked the former to not concern himself with it. Shastri on his part, without an ounce of fear, told Raghunathrao that he was the main culprit for the murder of his nephew. Hence Raghunathrao and the general public understood the degree of power that lay with the judiciary in a well-governmed state. But Shastri was dismissed from his office by Raghunathrao and went back to his native village.

Barbhais Council 
While Shastri was conducting his investigation, Sakharam Bapu ensured that pregnant Gangabai, the widow of Narayanrao, was secure and safe from harm's way. If Gangabai were to give birth to a male child, he would become the heir to the kingdom. But if she were to give birth to a female child, Sakharam Bapu contemplated the idea of making Ali Bahadur, the grandson of Baji Rao, the Peshwa of the Maratha empire. He convinced most of the Maratha chiefs from Raghunathrao's camp to switch sides without rousing his suspicion. He laid the foundations of a group of twelve Maratha officials and chiefs who were collectively known as the Barbhais Council (""Twelve Comrades""). These included Nana Phadnavis, Haripant Phadnavis, Babuji Naik, Maloji Ghorpade, Bhavanrao Pratinidhi, Raste, Patwardhans with the addition of Mahadji Shinde and Tukoji Holkar.

The Barbhais Council proceeded to go to war with Raghunathrao in order to bring him to justice and to save the state from British aggression. As it became apparent that Raghunathrao was losing the war, he shielded his allies from possible harm for the services they had rendered onto him. He sent Muhammad Yusuf to Mudhoji Bhonsle in Nagpur, Tulaji Pawar and Kharagsinh to Haidar Ali, and finally Sumersinh to Indore. On 18 April 1774, Gangabai gave birth to a son who was soon invested with the robes of the Peshwa. Raghunathrao essentially gave up his position as Peshwa and fled towards Surat. At the same time, the Barbhais Council re-established their power at Pune and requested Shastri to come back and assume his position as the Nyayadhish of the Maratha Empire. Shastri obliged but only after the Council agreed to never interfere with his duties and to faithfully execute the degrees he passed. The Council compelled Mudhoji and Haidra Ali to hand over the offenders they had been shielding and caught the ones who tried to escape. The most serious offenders such as Kharagsinh, Tujali Pawar and Muhammad Yusuf were sentenced to death, slightly less serious ones such as Vyankatrao Kashi and Sakharam Hari were sentenced to life imprisonment and the rest were discharged after having served their prison sentence.

Legacy
The Narayan Peth area in Pune is named after Peshwa Narayanrao.
There is a belief in Pune that Narayanrao's  ghost roams the ruins of Shaniwar Wada  at every full moon night and calls out for help just like the way he did on the fateful day of his assassination . Bajirao II believed in the ghost superstition too and planted thousands of mango trees around Pune city and gave donations to Brahmins and religious institutions in the hope that this would propitiate the ghost.
S. N. Patankar directed an early Indian silent film on the assassination of the Peshwa, titled Death of Narayanrao Peshwa, in 1915.

49,437,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type8,"Margaret Elter (c. 1525 - c. 1 February 1553), or Marguerite d'Elter, was a noblewoman from Guelders, relative of Anna 't Serclaes (wife of John Hooper, bishop of Gloucester), and Protestant refugee in Cambridge and Strasbourg.

Life
Margaret Elter was educated in a convent in Mons, Hainaut, in the Low Countries. In 1547 she fled for religious reasons to Basel, where she joined the household of Jacques de Bourgogne, Lord of Falais. In March 1548 at Strasbourg she married the Spanish Protestant Francisco de Enzinas, and shortly afterwards moved with him to England. A daughter was born in Cambridge the following year.

When her husband returned to Strasbourg in November 1549, she refused to accompany him, citing the baby's delicate health and the perils of winter travel. She finally joined him in June 1550, accompanied by her niece Anna Elter. A second daughter was born at Strasbourg in 1551. The plague took hold of the city in the winter of 1552/3, and Margaret Elter died about 1 February 1553, little more than a month after the death of her husband. The orphans, Margarita and Beatriz, became wards of the city. Philip Melanchthon offered to take one of them into his home in Wittenberg, but the city refused.

In July 1555, Anna Elter married the cavalry officer Guillaume Rabot de Salène, in a match arranged by the Elector Palatine. The couple promoted the interests of the orphans and probably engineered the publication of Enzinas's Mémoires (which had already attracted the interest of the Protestant martyrologists John Foxe and Ludwig Rabus) to secure funds for their maintenance. By these means they succeeded in their goal of keeping the children out of the hands of Catholic relatives in Spain.

One year before the creating of the TEE-network the French railway SNCF introduced three Trains d'affaires to link Paris with the industrial area in the North near the Belgian border. This trains were scheduled with a morning, midday and evening service in both directions. Initially the service was operated with RGP 600 DMUs. In 1959 these were replaced by locomotive hauled trains consisting of Corail coaches. Although domestic TEE-services were allowed from 1965 the Trains d'affaires were not upgraded until 1978. Together with the upgrading to TEE the trains were named. The evening service pair was named Watteau. In 1991 the service between Tourcoing and Paris was converted to a two-class Rapide. The Watteau revived in the Paris- Brussels service on 23 May 1993 for two years. On 26 May 1995 the Watteau was the last TEE service.

Deathbomb Arc is an independent record label based in Los Angeles, California, USA. It was started in 1998 by Brian Miller, originally to release music by the band Turbine. Miller's cat Leroy Brown was the label's acting CEO until his death in 2014.

Miller has described the label's ethos as a ""fuck you"" attitude towards a music industry that is afraid of new ideas"" and as ""a window into another universe... for those of us with an ear to new sounds, we're already in that other universe, but I want to reach people who normally have to wait years before an ""experimental"" act is deemed normal enough for them."" He characterises Deathbomb Arc as an ""artist label"" as well as a record label, treating record releases as just one part of an artistic spectrum. As an example, he cites clipping. as a Deathbomb Arc act, despite the group self-releasing their first album. According to clipping.'s William Hutson, ""The modus operandi of Deathbomb is punk as a way of being in the world, and not a type of music.""

Their website explains that ""our criteria for putting out bands is inexplicable"" and not constrained by genres. The label has released a wide range of styles including breakcore, noise rock, witch house, new age, hip hop, ambient, punk and techno. Notable releases include the first material from Clipping, JPEGMAFIA, Death Grips and Julia Holter.

Deathbomb Arc ran a digital singles club in 2011 and 2012, releasing a single each week by a wide variety of artists.

She has been a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2013, representing the electorate of Wanguri. She has been Deputy Chief Minister in the Gunner Ministry since the 2016 election and also Treasurer from 2016 to 2020.

|}

Manison was born in Tennant Creek, and she later studied journalism and public relations at Curtin University in Perth. Prior to entering politics, she worked as human resources and communications manager for MG Kailis Group and as a media advisor to former Labor leaders Paul Henderson and Delia Lawrie.

She was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 by-election after the resignation of former Chief Minister Paul Henderson. On 18 February 2013, opposition leader Delia Lawrie appointed Manison to the Labor frontbench in the portfolios of Public Employment and Public Housing. Manison was later promoted to Health, Essential Services, Statehood, Multicultural Affairs, Young Territorians and Senior Territorians portfolios.

Following Labor's victory at the 2016 election, Manison was sworn in as Treasurer of the Northern Territory on 31 August, replacing former Chief Minister Adam Giles. On 11 September, she was selected as the new deputy leader of the Labor Party and Deputy Chief Minister, following the defeat of Lynne Walker at the election. She was also designated as Minister for Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics and Minister for Children.

The aftermath of the 2020 election saw a reshuffle of the ministry. Chief Minister Michael Gunner opted to become his own Treasurer, but retained Manison as his deputy. Manison was sworn into the new cabinet as Minister for Fire, Police and Ambulance Services, Mining and Industry, Northern Australia and Trade, Defence Industries, Agribusiness and Aquaculture, and International Education.

History

Spanish colonization

The first Spanish troops to arrive to Guatemala were led by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado in 1524. On arrival to Guatemala, the Spaniards discovered various Maya speaking and Nahua speaking polities within the territory. The Spaniards, with help of indigenous allies and troops from Mexico, began to slowly conquer the peoples of Guatemala. The first and major battles involved the K'iche' people who were defeated in March 1524 and resulted in the capture and sacking of the K'iche' capital of Q'umarkaj. In 1525, Spanish conquistador of the Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés arrived to Petén to subdue the rebellious Cristóbal de Olid who had been sent to conquer Honduras. Cortés soon returned to New Spain after the battles.

Soon after the conquest of southern Guatemala, the Spanish, in 1557 founded the city Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala which was to be the capital of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Spanish missionaries soon began to Guatemala to convert the native indigenous people to Catholicism. In March 1697, the Spanish fully conquered all of Guatemala for the Spanish crown after the conquest of Petén. The Captaincy General of Guatemala became part of New Spain and was governed by the Viceroy of New Spain based in Mexico City.

Independence

In 1808, Joseph Bonaparte was installed as King of Spain and several Spanish American colonies began to declare their independence from Spain. As Guatemala and most Central American nations were governed by Mexico City; New Spain declared its independence from Spain in 1810. In 1821, the Plan of Iguala which declared Mexico as a constitutional monarchy. Guatemala declared its own independence from Spain on 15 September 1821 and chose to join the Mexican Empire under Emperor Agustín de Iturbide.

In March 1823, Iturbide resigned as Emperor and Mexico became a republic. Guatemala decided to separate from Mexico on 1 July 1823. Guatemala, along with El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica formed the Federal Republic of Central America (with the exception of the Guatemala province of Chiapas which choose to remain part of Mexico in July 1824). In 1839 the Central American Federation dissolved and Guatemala became an independent nation.

Post-Independence
In May 1863, Guatemala and Spain signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Recognition. During the 1920s, several hundred Spaniards immigrated to Guatemala. In 1960, Guatemala entered into a civil war between the government and various leftist rebel groups supported chiefly by ethnic Maya indigenous people and Ladino peasants. In September 1977, King Juan Carlos I of Spain paid an official visit to Guatemala, his first and only trip as King to the country.

Burning of the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala
In the early morning of 31 January 1980, a group of Guatemalan peasants from the Committee for Peasant Unity, joined by workers and students, entered the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City. The protesters announced that they had come to the embassy peacefully and that they would hold a press conference to state their grievances against the Guatemalan government. The protesters choose to enter the Spanish embassy as Spain had been sympathetic towards their cause. At the time the protesters entered, the Spanish Ambassador, Máximo Cajal López was meeting with former Guatemalan Vice-President Eduardo Rafael Cáceres Lehnhoff at the embassy.

The Spanish Ambassador met with the protesters and announced to the government that they hope for a peaceful negotiation to take place. Guatemalan President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia and police and government officials immediately met at the National Palace and decided to remove the protesters by force from the embassy. Just before noon that same day, 300 armed state agents surrounded the building and cut the electricity, water and telephone lines. The armed agents entered the building and began to shoot at the protesters who ran to barricade themselves in the various offices. During the commotion, a fire broke out on the second floor of the embassy. As the fire blazed, the police refused to allow volunteers and firefighters to enter the building to save those trapped on the second floor. 37 people died during the fire, including the former Vice-President Cáceres Lehnhoff and Vicente Menchú, father of future Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Rigoberta Menchú, as well protesters and Spanish embassy employees. There were only two survivors for the fire, the Spanish Ambassador who narrowly escaped and protester Gregorio Yujá Xona. Both were taken to Herrera Llerandi Hospital for treatment.

On 1 February, 20 armed men entered the hospital and kidnapped Gregorio Yujá Xona. His dead body was later found tortured. On him was a sign stating that the Spanish Ambassador Máximo Cajal López was next. The Ambassador, with assistance from the diplomatic staff left the hospital and fled the country. On 2 February 1980, Spain severed diplomatic relations with Guatemala over the incident at the embassy and the threat on its diplomatic staff.

In September 1984, Guatemala and Spain re-established diplomatic relations. In 1999, Rigoberta Menchú presented charges for torture, genocide, illegal detention and state-sponsored terrorism against former President Ríos Montt and four other retired Guatemalan generals, two of them ex-presidents in Spain as Spain's Constitutional Court ruled in 2005 that Spanish courts can try those accused of crimes against humanity even if the victims were not of Spanish origin. In July 2006, a Spanish judge ordered an arrest warrant for Ríos Montt and others accused of genocide.

Living peopleExtensive growth, in economics, is growth in the quantity of output produced based on the expansion of the quantity of inputs used. It contrasts with intensive growth, which arises from inputs being used more productively. For example, GDP growth caused only by increases in population or territory would be extensive growth. Thus, extensive growth is likely to be subject to diminishing returns. It is therefore often viewed as having no effect on per-capita magnitudes in the long-run. 

Reliance on extensive growth can be undesirable in the long-run because it exhausts resources. To maintain economic growth in the long-run, especially on a per-capita basis, it is good for an economy to grow intensively—for example, by improvements in technology or organisation, thereby shifting the economy’s production possibilities frontier outward.

66,452,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type1,"Thomas Joseph Downey (born January 28, 1949) is an American attorney, lobbyist and former politician who served as a U.S. Representative for New York's 2nd congressional district from 1975 to 1993.

Early life and education
Downey was born in Queens, New York City to Norma (née Morgillo) and Thomas A. Downey Jr. He graduated from West Islip High School in West Islip, New York, in 1966, and went on to earn a B.S. from Cornell University in 1970. He attended St. John's University School of Law from 1972 to 1974, and earned a Juris Doctor from the Washington College of Law of American University in 1980.

Career 
He served as Suffolk County, New York legislator from 1972 to 1975, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1972.

U.S. House of Representatives 
In 1974, he was elected as Democrat to the 94th United States Congress; at 25, he was the youngest member of that Congress. He was re-elected to the eight succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1975 – January 3, 1993) and unsuccessfully ran for reelection to the 103rd United States Congress in 1992. He lost his seat after it was revealed that he was among several lawmakers who had frequently overdrawn their House bank accounts without penalty, and that his wife at the time was a House bank auditor.

As a member of the United States House Committee on Armed Services, Downey specialized in arms control issues, serving as an adviser to the negotiation teams for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and START I talks. As a member of the Budget and Ways and Means Committees, he advocated for welfare reform and child care legislation.

In March 1985, Downey was involved in a physical scuffle in the House chamber with Republican Congressman Bob Dornan. Dornan, a veteran of the United States Air Force, had earlier described Downey in a public speech as ""a draft dodging wimp."" During the Vietnam War, Downey protested U.S. involvement and was medically exempt from military service because of a perforated eardrum. Downey confronted Dornan and demanded an apology. Dornan refused and told Downey that if he encountered Downey outside the House chamber, when he wasn't under the protection of the Sergeant at Arms, Dornan would be glad to continue the altercation. Downey attempted to leave, and Dornan grabbed Downey by the collar and tie. Downey ended the confrontation by walking away. Tip O'Neill, the Speaker of the House, responded to the scuffle by informing Dornan that violence was a violation of House rules.

Later career 
A close confidante of Al Gore since their days in the House of Representatives, Downey played Jack Kemp in Gore's 1996 Vice Presidential debate rehearsals. He was set to play George W. Bush in Gore's rehearsals for the 2000 Presidential debates; however, after mysteriously receiving a package containing Bush's debate preparation materials, he stepped aside to avoid the appearance of an improper advantage for Gore.

Since leaving politics, Downey has worked as a lobbyist and chair of Downey McGrath Group, Inc., a lobbying firm he founded in 1993. The president is Ray McGrath, also a former U.S. Representative from New York. Downey represented Dubai Ports World and lobbied Congress to approve the controversial ports deal. Downey argues that ""they would have made this country more secure"" because ""DP World is one of the few companies that could have worked with us to truly improve security, both at home and abroad."" Other past clients included energy companies like Chevron and the Standard Renewable Energy Group, several foreign countries, and the Albright Group. He retired from lobbying in 2015.

He has served on the advisory board for Council for a Livable World, a non-partisan advocacy organization dedicated to reducing the danger of nuclear weapons. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

Personal life 
In 1978, Downey married Chris Milanos, with whom he is the father of two children, Lauren Katherine and Theodore Jonathan. They later divorced, and on June 21, 2007, Downey married Carol Browner, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency.

92,453,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type3,"The notion that the Apollo Moon landings were hoaxes perpetrated by NASA and other agencies has appeared many times in popular culture. Not all references to Moon landing conspiracy theories are in support of them, but the ideas expressed in them have become a popular meme to reference, both in humor and sincerity.

Precursors in other media 
In 1956 James E. Gunn wrote a science fiction story entitled ""Cave of Night"" in which the United States Air Force fakes the first crewed American spaceflight. When lack of funds precludes a survivable crewed mission, the mission is faked to spur funding for a real space program. The Air Force launches the craft carrying a transmitter relaying prerecorded messages from the pilot. The Air Force later claims that the astronaut died in orbit, and that his body will remain in orbit until the craft disintegrates in the atmosphere. The conspiracy is nearly exposed by a radio reporter who sees the astronaut on Earth after his supposed ""death,"" but he is forced to destroy his evidence by the government. ""Cave of Night"" was adapted for radio and broadcast as an episode of the popular program X Minus One on February 1, 1956, a full five years before Yuri Gagarin's first crewed spaceflight.

In print 
 Former President Bill Clinton in his 2004 autobiography, My Life, states: ""Just a month before, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague, Michael Collins, aboard spaceship Columbia and walked on the moon...The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened. I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn't believe it for a minute, that 'them television fellers' could make things look real that weren't. Back then, I thought he was a crank. During my eight years in Washington, I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.""
 Norman Mailer in 1969 wrote: ""Besides - the event [Apollo 11 moonwalk] is obdurate on the surface and a mystery beneath. It’s not at all easy to comprehend. Like an adolescent married before he can vote, and trying to react the congratulations ""You’re a married man"", a remark which has no reality to the brand-new groom, so America and the world were in a round of congratulations - we had landed a man on the moon. The event was so removed, however, so unreal, that no objective correlative existed to prove it had not been an event staged in a television studio—the greatest con of the century—and indeed a good mind, product of the iniquities, treacheries, gold, passions, invention, deception, and rich worldly stink of the Renaissance could hardly deny that the event if bogus was as great a creation in mass hoodwinking, deception, and legerdemain as the true ascent was in discipline and technology. Indeed, conceive of the genius of such a conspiracy. It would take criminals and confidence men mightier, more trustworthy and more resourceful than anything in this century or the ones before. Merely to conceive of such men was the surest way to know the event was not staged. Yes, the century was a giant and a cretin. Man had become a Herculean embodiment of the Vision, but the brain on the top of the head was as small as a transistorized fist, and the chambers of the heart had shrunk to the dry hard seeds of some hybrid future.""

In film 
 In the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, a brief scene depicts the action taking place in a Moon setting where astronauts are being trained. Agent 007 steals what appears to be a Moon buggy from the model set, and drives it off to escape from an enemy compound. This scene may have helped to spread the idea of the Moon landings being a hoax. However, model sets like the one in the film had been used prior to the Moon landing in order to simulate conditions.
 The 1978 film Capricorn One portrayed a fictional NASA attempt to fake a landing on the planet Mars, in a plot inspired by Apollo hoax theories.
 In the 2009 film Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder, Fry reads Richard Nixon's mind and learns that the president staged the Moon landing, but it took place on the planet Venus.
 The 2012 documentary Room 237 featured film analysis by fans of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining, connecting Kubrick's film with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and other major events. (See 2012 video by Michael Wysmierski below.)
 In the 2014 film Interstellar, the US Government deliberately promotes Moon landing conspiracy theories to discredit NASA and encourage people to seek Earth-based solutions to an ongoing global famine, rather than have people focus on leaving the planet; this is an example of a post-truth society.
 In the 2015 comedy film Moonwalkers, a CIA agent tries to hire Stanley Kubrick for the Apollo 11 Moon landing scene.
 The 2016 film Operation Avalanche is about CIA agents who, when they find NASA is incapable of meeting the 1969 deadline for the Apollo 11 Moon landing, simulate the landing with a film crew.

On television 
 In 2002, the Franco-German television network Arte aired the spoof documentary Dark Side of the Moon, 'exposing' how Stanley Kubrick was recruited to fake the Moon landings. It featured interviews with Kubrick's widow and a number of American statesmen. including Henry Kissinger and Donald Rumsfeld. The interviews and other footage were presented out of context and in some cases completely staged, with actors playing interviewees who had never existed—and named, in many cases, after characters from Kubrick's films; this was one of many clues included to reveal the joke to the alert viewer. 
 In the Futurama episode ""Roswell That Ends Well,"" President Harry S. Truman orders the creation of NASA after cancelling the faked Moon landing. He admonishes them ""to get off their fannies"" and get to work.  During ""Into The Wild Green Yonder"" President Nixon's head admits that the Moon landing was faked - it was really carried out on Venus.
 In the 2007 Codename: Kids Next Door episode ""Operation: M.O.O.N."", it is revealed that Kids Next Door agents faked the moon landing by intercepting Apollo missions and placing the astronauts on a moon set in order to protect the secret of their moonbase, with the episode being focused around the current generation of Kids Next Door working to do the same thing with an attempted moon colonization mission.
 The August 27, 2008, MythBusters episode ""NASA Moon Landing"" tested and debunked some common claims made by Moon landing conspiracy theorists.
 On the SyFy show Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files lead investigator Ben Hansen and his team investigate on whether or not the Moon landing could have been faked. They claimed this proved it could have been faked but they all believe that it happened for real.
 In the Friends episode ""The One With Rachel's Other Sister,"" Joey needs a lie and Phoebe suggest man walking on the Moon, replying, ""you can see the strings people!""
 During an episode of QI, the panel discussed the Moon landing, and the various conspiracies surrounding it. All of them agreed that the landing did take place, although Alan Davies admitted he used to believe some of the photographs were faked, until he worked with Sir Patrick Moore who angrily pointed out how much work he had put into mapping out the Moon for NASA. According to Alan, Moore also said that if he met Alan again, he would be sick in his eye. Host Stephen Fry summed up by saying that ""for every ill-conceived argument that the Moon landings were a hoax, there's a perfectly logical explanation to put our minds at rest.""
 The faking of the Moon landing, along with conspiracy theories concerning the Kennedy assassination and alien coverups, made a prominent appearance in a 2005 episode of Fat Pizza. The events of this episode were revisited and expanded on in two 2019 episodes, the latter of which included a cameo by real life Moon hoax proponent Jarrah White.
 On a 2009 episode of Mock the Week, one of the questions was about the 40th anniversary of the Moon landing. Frankie Boyle then went into a short but furious rant about how it couldn't have happened, citing NASA's technical failures over the years as proof that they were incapable of such a thing. Hugh Dennis jokingly suggested that the ""faked moon landing"" Boyle was actually thinking of was ""the one with Wallace & Gromit.""
 In the Arrested Development episode ""The B. Team"", Ron Howard tells Michael Bluth that he and his brother hid in the rafters and saw that NASA faked the Apollo 11 landing on the set of Gentle Ben, but that NASA actually did land on the moon in 1971 (which would be either Apollo 14 or 15). 
 In the Elementary episode ""The Red Team,"" Sherlock Holmes interrogates a suspect who along with the victim, believed Neil Armstrong didn't walk on the Moon.
 The X-Files episode ""My Struggle III"" features the Cigarette Smoking Man supervising the filming of a faked Apollo 11 landing in 1969.

Power generators in the Texas Interconnection, managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, participate in an energy-only electricity market and are compensated only for the electricity they produce. The wholesale generation market was deregulated in 1995 and the distribution market in 1999, with Texas Senate Bill 7. This replaced the prior system in which power was generated and consumed locally by the same utility with one in which retail providers contracted with generators across the state.

As a result, 85% of Texas power consumers (those served by a company not owned by a municipality or a utility cooperative) could choose their electricity service from a variety of retail electric providers (REPs), including the incumbent utility.  The incumbent utility in the area still owns and maintains the local power lines (and is the company to call in the event of a power outage) and was not subject to deregulation. Customers served by cooperatives or municipal utilities could choose an alternate REP only if the utility has opted in to deregulation; only the Nueces Electric Cooperative has chosen to opt in.

Between taking effect in 2002 and 2006, approximately 85% of commercial and industrial consumers switched power providers at least once. As of 2008, approximately 40% of residential consumers in deregulated areas switched from the former incumbent provider to a competitive REP. REPs providing service in the state include AmeriPower, TriEagle Energy, Acacia Energy, Ambit Energy, Breeze Energy, Bulb Energy, Clearview Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Conservice Energy,  Iluminar Energy, Now Power, Snap Energy, Entrust Energy, Bounce Energy, Champion Energy, Shnye Energy, Cirro Energy, Direct Energy, Dynowatt, First Texas Energy Corporation, Frontier Utilities, Gexa Energy, Glacial Energy, Just Energy, Kinetic Energy, Mega Energy, APG&E, Adjacent Energy, Spark Energy, StarTex Power, Stream Energy, Tech Electricity, Texas Power, TXU Energy, XOOM Energy and 4Change Energy.

According to a 2014 report by the Texas Coalition for Affordable Power (TCAP), ""deregulation cost Texans about $22 billion from 2002 to 2012. And residents in the deregulated market pay prices that are considerably higher than those who live in parts of the state that are still regulated. For example, TCAP found that the average consumer living in one of the areas that opted out of deregulation, such as Austin and San Antonio, paid $288 less in 2012 than consumers in the deregulated areas."" However, the report concluded that re-regulating the market would not solve the issue. TCAP instead offered a series of reforms designed to increase market efficiency.

Background 

Texas has electricity consumption of $24 billion a year, the highest among the U.S. states. Its annual consumption is comparable to that of Great Britain and Spain. Texas produces the most wind electricity in the U.S., but also has the highest carbon dioxide emissions of any state. As of 2021, Texas residential electricity rates ranked 21st in the United States and average monthly residential electric bills in Texas were the 5th highest in the nation.

System 

The law designated the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to be the authority to oversee grid reliability and operations so as to ensure no particular buyer or seller would gain an unfair advantage in the market.

The ""price to beat"" 
Included within SB7 was the notion of the ""price to beat"" or PTB, an idea of a regulated rate governing the pricing behavior of the former utilities.

According to a typical economic theory, prices are optimally determined in a fair and transparent market, and not by a political or academic body. In deregulation of electricity markets, one immediate concern with pricing is that incumbent electricity providers would undercut the prices of new entrants, deterring competition with extensive barriers to entry. This would perpetuate the existing natural monopoly of providers. Thus, the SB7 bill introduced a phase-in period during which a price floor would be established (for incumbent electricity companies) to prevent this predatory practice, allowing new market entrants to become established. New market entrants could charge a price below the price to beat, but incumbents could not. This period was to last from 2002 to January 1, 2007. As of 2007 Texas investor owned utility affiliates no longer have price-to-beat tariffs.

In order to prompt entry into the market, the price to beat would have to be high enough to allow for a modest profit by new entrants. Thus, it had to be above the cost of inputs such as natural gas and coal. For example, a price to beat fixed at the actual wholesale procurement price of electricity does not give potential entrants a margin to compete against incumbent utilities.  Second, the price to beat would have to be reasonably low, to enable as many customers as possible to continue to consume electricity during the transition period.

Results

Electricity prices

Although a desired effect of competition is to lower electricity rates, the residential rate for electricity increased seven times in the four years after deregulation. Nationwide data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Texas's electric prices did rise above the national average immediately after deregulation from 2003 to 2009, but from 2010 to 2015, prices dropped significantly below the national average price, with a total cost of $0.0863 per kWh in Texas in 2015 vs. $0.1042 nationally, or 17 percent lower in Texas. Between 2002 and 2014 the total cost to Texas consumers is estimated to be $24 billion, an average of $5,100 per household more than comparable markets under state regulation.

During the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm, due to the deregulated electricity market and the spike in demand, wholesale electricity prices shot up in some places by 10,000 percent. As a result, Texans who pay wholesale prices such as with retailer Griddy received exceptionally expensive electric bills as high as $450 for one day of use.

New competition
The price to beat seemed to accomplish its goal of attracting competitors to the market during the period through January 1, 2007. It allowed competitors to enter the market without allowing the incumbents to undercut them in price. It has also given energy consumers the ability to compare energy rates offered by different providers. The less-regulated providers undercut the price to beat by only a small margin given that they must balance lower prices (to attract customers and build market share) with higher prices (needed to reinvest in new power plants). Due to the small difference in competing prices and slow (yearly or so) ""buying"" process, price decrease due to competition was very slow, and it took a few years to offset the original increase by ""traditional"" electric providers and move to lower rates.

One of the benchmarks of a successful free market is the range of choice provided to customers.  Choice can be viewed both in terms of the number of firms active in the market as well as the variety of products those firms offer to consumers.  In the first decade of retail electric deregulation in Texas, the market experienced dramatic changes in both metrics.  In 2002, residential customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area could choose between 10 retail electric providers offering 11 price plans.  By the end of 2012, there were 45 retail electric providers offering 258 price plans to residential customers in that market.  Similar increases in the number of retail electric providers and available plans have been realized in other deregulated electricity market areas with the state.

Environmental impact
In environmental impact, results are mixed. With the ability to invest profits to satisfy further energy demand, producers like TXU proposed eleven new coal-fired power plants in 2006. Coal power plants were cheaper than natural gas-fired powerplants, but produce more pollution. When the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group announced the take-over of TXU, the company which was known for charging the highest rates in the state and was losing customers, they called off plans for eight of the coal plants.  TXU had invested more heavily in the other three.  A few weeks later the buyers announced plans for two cleaner IGCC coal plants.

There are positive environmental impacts from retail price deregulation as well. The profitable and growing Texas electricity market has drawn considerable investment by wind power companies. In July 2006, Texas surpassed California in wind energy production.

Higher electricity prices encourage resident to reduce their electrical usage by using more moderate thermostat settings, installing insulation, installing solar screens, and other such activities. Texas utilities (such as Austin Energy) are also installing advanced electricity meters that may one day enable variable pricing based on the time of day. This would permit energy customers to save money by further tailoring their consumption based on whether it occurred during the peak demand period (high cost/high pollution) or the off-peak (night time).

In 2018, Texas had the 12th highest per capita energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by state in the United States.

Effect on renewable energy 

Due to the increased usage of natural gas immediately after deregulation, new-era energy tools such as wind power and smart-grid technology were greatly aided.  Texas's first renewable portfolio standard — or requirement that the state's utilities get a certain amount of their power from renewable energy like wind — was signed into law in 1999, as part of the same legislation that deregulated the electric market.

82,455,2057-8-8 00:00:00,note_type5,"Degraves Street is a pedestrian precinct and thoroughfare in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is a short, narrow laneway in the Central Business District that runs north–south from Flinders Street to Flinders Lane and is situated in-between Swanston Street and Elizabeth Street. Degraves, as the street is colloquially known, is famous for its alfresco dining options and because it epitomises Melbourne's coffee culture and street art scene. For these reasons it has also become a popular tourist destination.

The street is named after Charles and William Degraves, pioneer merchants from Hobart who built a flour mill at the corner of Flinders Lane and Degraves Street in 1849. William was also notably a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for fourteen years.

Location 
The cobbled bluestone alley forms a busy alternative thoroughfare for commuters disembarking from Flinders Street station toward the shopping areas of Block Arcade on Collins Street and Bourke Street Mall. 

Degraves Street is often confused and therefore synonymous with Centre Place, a similar walkway situated diagonally on the other side of Flinders Lane. Degraves Street also offshoots to the east into a dead end (sharing the same name) about halfway down its length.

Campbell Arcade (also referred to as the Degraves Underpass) was built in the 1950s to allow pedestrians to walk from Flinders Street Station to Degraves Street underground, rather than walking across busy Flinders Street. It is used by thousands of people every day. The arcade is home to the Platform Artists Group who frequently exhibit  artworks amongst the arcade's iconic pink tiles and black marble columns.

Culture 

Degraves features numerous bars, shops, cafes and restaurants. The art deco architecture, dining umbrellas and café canopies mean the street is often described as having a Parisian or European flavour. Redevelopment of the Mutual Store in 2006 has further enhanced the lane with additional shops.

Many of the taller, older buildings were also converted into loft style apartments in the 1990s, adding further life to the area. Street art and graffiti are commonplace, whilst buskers/street performers also frequent the laneway, adding to its atmosphere.

The Majorca Building, built in the 1930s, dominates the view at the northern end of Degraves Street. The building was designed by Harry Norris and is cladded in faience tiles.

The film stars Aishwarya as the title character along Vikram ,  while Tarun, Poornam Vishwanathan, Gandhimathi, Janagaraj, and Chinni Jayanth play supporting roles. Nassar and Sarathkumar make friendly appearances, and the latter has a cameo appearance. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja with cinematography by P. C. Sreeram and editing by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan. The film released on 18 December 1992.

Plot 
Meera is in college and pregnant nearing labour. Here, she tells her story of how she got to this point in a flashback.

A young man named Jeeva falls in love with her. She despises him and eventually gets him kicked out of college. After a fight with Jeeva near her house, Meera goes out for a walk and sees a woman getting killed by a policeman. She is terrified and runs to the police station to report the crime. Unfortunately for her, the officer at the station is, shockingly, the murderer. The officer, knowing the sole witness to his crime, sends goons to her house to kill her.

By then, Meera has already left and is on the run. Jeeva goes to Meera's house and finds the maid getting beaten by the goons. There is a fight between Jeeva and the goons. Jeeva wins, and the maid tells him that he should go after Meera. They are now on the run, and the murderer sends six professional killers after the duo. Along the way, Meera and Jeeva get arrested by a comedic policeman and later flee. They find a blacksmith and are freed of the handcuffs but are almost killed by the goons in the shootout.

Meera leaves Jeeva but has a change of heart and comes back. She finds the goons who have Jeeva, and the goons tie them together on train tracks. They narrowly escape. After this event, Meera admits her love for Jeeva. After a run-in with the murderer, Meera and Jeeva end up in the ocean and wash up near the house of a boy named Jesu and his grandfather. They seek refuge there, and Meera gets close with Jesu. While everyone is getting ready for Jesu's birthday, his dog runs off into the forest. The goons kill the dog and go after Meera. Meera and Jesu flee on his bike, but they fall off, and Jesu gets killed.

Jeeva takes revenge and kills the goons in gruesome ways. A final showdown occurs between the murderer and Jeeva. The murderer gets the upper hand and almost succeeds, but Meera shoots him and Jeeva sets him on fire.

The final scene is a group photo with everyone, and Meera goes into labour.

18,458,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type9,"The Gender Equality Index is a measurement tool that shows how far (or close) the EU and its Member States are from achieving a gender-equal society. It was developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE).

The Index produces a score that between 1 and 100. The best situation is 100, where there are no gender gaps combined with the highest level of achievement.

The Index was published in 2013 and 2015. In October 2017, the third edition was released. The newest one provides scores for four points in time: 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2015.

Purpose of the Gender Equality Index 

The Index aims at supporting evidence-based and better-informed decision-making in the EU. The Gender Equality Index is the only one that gives a comprehensive map of gender inequalities in the EU based on EU policy priorities and realities.

The Index relies on a gender perspective. This means that gender equality is considered to be advantageous to both women and men, while not underplaying the unequal relations of power harming women in society. It also emphasises that all gender gaps are harmful to both women and men.

Areas of gender equality covered 

The Index measures gender equality in eight areas, called ‘domains’, relevant to the EU policy framework. Six of these domains (work, money, knowledge, time, power, and health) are combined into a core Index. Each domain is further divided into sub-domains that cover the key issues within the respective area.

The core Index is complemented by two additional, equally important, satellite domains of violence and intersecting inequalities. They belong to the Index, but do not impact the overall score. The full conceptual framework is presented in the first edition of the Index.

Using this framework, 31 indicators were chosen to monitor developments in gender equality in the six core domains in every Member State as well as at the EU level. The Index is formed by combining these indicators into a single measure, which allows for the issue of gender equality to be synthesised into one core.

Core domains

Satellite domains

Index main results 

The Index points in time: 2005, 2010, 2012 and 2015 for the European Union as a whole, as well as individual Member States. This provides readers with sufficient evidence to assess progress over an entire decade. The main results of the third edition of the Index were released in Brussels on 11 October 2017, and were livestreamed on EIGE's website.

Progress towards gender equality in the EU-28 is rather slow – the Gender Equality Index score for EU-28 in 2015 stood at 66.2 out of 100, representing a 4.2-point increase in ten years. 

The biggest improvement towards gender equality over the past decade has been in the domain of power, especially in economic decision-making. However, while it has made the most progress, its score remains the lowest of all domains. The least amount of progress in gender equality has been in the domain of time. Progress has slipped in 12 countries when it comes to the time use of women and men. Only every third man engages daily in cooking and housework, compared to almost eight in ten women (79%). Men also have more time for sporting, cultural and leisure activities.

The third edition contains methodological updates. In addition to political and economic power, the Index also looks at who is behind the news headlines, who controls the money in research funding and who decides in the sporting world in the EU. These measurements now form an integral part of the power domain. For the first time, the Index also looks into healthy and risky behaviours of women and men. Who has a healthy diet and exercises regularly? How similar are the smoking and drinking habits of women and men in the EU? The answers to these questions make an impact on the final Index score in the domain of health.

The Gender Equality Index will be updated every two years until 2019. From then on it will be updated annually.

Gender equalityFantastic Mr. Fox is an opera in three acts composed by Tobias Picker to a libretto by Donald Sturrock based on Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name. It was premiered by Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on December 9, 1998. In 2010, it was adapted into an abridged version with seven instrumentalists, and in 2011, a full-length version with the same reduced orchestration. In 2019, Fantastic Mr. Fox was recorded by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Odyssey Opera and released on Albany Records; this album won the 2020 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

Performance history
Picker's second opera (after his 1996 Emmeline) Fantastic Mr Fox was commissioned by the Roald Dahl Foundation. It received its world premiere performance by the Los Angeles Opera on December 9, 1998. 

In 2010, Stephen Barlow staged a new version of the work commissioned by Opera Holland Park especially designed to be performed promenade style in the gardens of Holland Park. This version, in an abridged form for seven instruments, starred Grant Doyle as Mr. Fox, Olivia Ray as Mrs. Fox, Laura Woods (Mezzo-Soprano) as Agnes The Digger, Jaimee Marshall as Miss Hedgehog, Henry Grant Kerswell, Peter Kent and John Lofthouse as Farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. 

An additional full-length orchestral version was toured by English Touring Opera in 2011. The world premiere of a full-length seven-instrument chamber version was produced September 2011 in Pittsburgh, PA and starred Daniel Teadt as Mr. Fox, Katherine Brandt as Mrs. Fox, Leah Dyer as Miss Hedgehog, Sean Donaldson, Jeffrey Gross, Sean Lenhart as Farmers Boggis, Bunce & Bean.

In 2014, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Odyssey Opera performed and recorded Fantastic Mr. Fox at Boston University's Jordan Hall, conducted by Gil Rose and featuring John Brancy as Mr. Fox, Krista River as Mrs. Fox, and Andrew Craig Brown, Edwin Vega, and Gabriel Preisser as Boggis, Bunce, & Bean. The recording of this performance was released in 2019 on BMOP/sound, and won the 2020 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

Roles

Synopsis 
A modern fable, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a story about good vs. evil, animal vs. human, and technology. With the help of the other creatures of the forest, Mr. Fox must outwit his enemies to keep his family safe. Mr. Fox finds that he may have stolen one hen too many from the henhouse, as the meanest farmers anywhere — Boggis, Bunce, and Bean (one fat, one short, one lean) — conspire to rid their lands of the Fox family once and for all. The Foxes are able to evade capture with the help of some woodland friends, leaving the farmers laying in wait while the animals help themselves to the fruit of the farmers’ lands. Having had their revenge, the animals return for a sumptuous feast far from danger in the Foxes‘ new home, while the farmers continue to wait in the rain.

(with a capital ""A""). It was marketed by the Baudriller nursery, Angers, France, and appeared in their catalogue of 1880 as U. Americana pyramidata. Wesmael's Ulmus americana and Ulmus americana var. variegata, however, do not appear from herbarium specimens to have been American white elm (see Ulmus americana 'Variegata'). It is known that nurseries in Europe and America marketed the golden wych elm Ulmus glabra 'Lutescens' as Ulmus americana aurea, so it is possible that Wesmael's Ulmus americana pyramidalis was similarly misnamed.

Description
The clone was pyramid-shaped.

Cultivation
No specimens are known to survive.

Synonymy

Missing elm cultivarsEdward Ravenscroft (c. 1654–1707) was an English dramatist who belonged to an ancient Flintshire family.

He was entered at the Middle Temple, but devoted his attention mainly to literature. Among his pieces are: 
 The Citizen Turned Gentleman (Dorset Garden, 1671, pr. 1675)
The Careless Lovers (Dorset Garden, 1673, pr. 1673), a comedy of intrigue
 The Wrangling Lovers (Dorset Garden, 1676)
Scaramouch a Philosopher, Harlequin a Schoolboy, Bravo a Merchant and Magician (Theatre Royal, 1677)
 King Edgar and Alfreda (Theatre Royal, 1677)
English Lawyer (Theatre Royal, 1678), an adaptation of George Ruggle's Latin play of Ignoramus, presented before James I at Cambridge in March 1615;
The London Cuckolds (Dorset Garden, 1681, pr. 1683), which became a stock piece, but was struck out of the repertory by David Garrick in 1751
 Dame Dobson (1683)
Titus Andronicus, or, The rape of Lavinia acted at the Theatre Royall: a tragedy, alter'd from Mr. Shakespears works / by Mr. Edw. Ravens croft. 1686.
 The Canterbury Guests (Drury Lane, 1694)
The Italian Husband (Lincoln's Inn Fields, 1697).
He wrote a total of twelve plays, in which he adapted freely from Molière, William Shakespeare and others. He ventured to decry the heroic drama, and John Dryden retaliated by satirizing his Mamamouchi, a foolish adaptation from Molière's Bourgeois Gentilhomme and Monsieur de Pourceaugnac, in the prologue to the Assignation (Dryden, Works, ed. Scott, iv. 345 seq.)

Ravenscroft was the first critic to posit that Shakespeare's play Titus Andronicus was not originally written by him. In 1686 he revived the play at the Drury Lane Theatre, which he entitled Titus Andronicus, or the rape of Lavinia, he wrote in the address ""to the Reader"", ""I have been told by some anciently conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his (Shakespeare's), but brought by a private Author to be Acted and he only gave some Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts or Characters; this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his Works, It seems rather a heap of Rubbish then a Structure."" This position is now known as the ""Ravenscroft tradition"" within literary circles.

70,462,2059-10-10 00:00:00,note_type4,"Doyle Community Park is an urban park on the eastern edge of downtown Santa Rosa, California. The western end of the park is the confluence of Matanzas Creek and Spring Creek. Spring Creek forms the northern park boundary and Matanzas Creek forms the southern park boundary. The eastern end of the park is a fenced and lighted baseball field formerly used by the minor league Santa Rosa Pirates. The remainder of the park includes the Doyle Park Clubhouse, restrooms, playground slides and swings, horseshoe pits, separate fenced areas for unleashed large and small dogs, and picnic tables with barbecue grills including five sites available for reservation.

A paved trail follows the shaded riparian woodland of mature oaks, maples, and California bay laurel trees along Spring Creek and Matanzas Creek from the Doyle Park Clubhouse on Hoen Avenue to the footbridge over Matanzas Creek across Vallejo Street from Brook Hill School. Prior to European settlement, what is now Doyle Park was part of a larger riparian wetland within which these creeks changed course when dead trees fell into their channels and accumulated coarse woody debris diverted flood runoff out of those channels to form new channels. Europeans deepened the present creek channels about  through Quaternary alluvium of the Santa Rosa Plain to minimize urban flooding. The park and paved trail is at the level of the original wetland, but there are a few access points into the lower channels which now confine the creeks.

Western gray squirrels are plentiful in the park, and a murder of crows often gather nearby. Birdwatchers have observed sparrows, finches, towhees, jays, woodpeckers, robins, bluebirds, mockingbirds, chickadees, phoebes, kinglets, warblers, nuthatch, and titmouse.

Frank Pierce Doyle
Frank Doyle (1863-1948) and his father Manville Doyle formed the Exchange Bank of Santa Rosa in 1890. Frank purchased the land for Doyle Community Park as a memorial for his 13-year-old son who died during tonsillectomy surgery in 1921. Frank encouraged improvement of local transportation, including building the Golden Gate Bridge. While touring the bridge construction site two months before the opening, Frank rode in the first private automobile across the bridge, and was designated ""Father of the Golden Gate."" When Frank died, 50.4% of the Exchange Bank common stock was put into a perpetual trust as the Frank P. Doyle and Polly O’Meara Doyle Scholarship Fund. Since 1948, this scholarship fund has provided over $90 million to more than 135,000 Sonoma County students attending Santa Rosa Junior College. The fund also provides $2,000 annually for maintenance of Doyle Community Park.

Parks in Sonoma County, CaliforniaR v Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision regarding the scope of police powers to enter into private dwellings without a warrant in order to protect lives. The Court affirmed that police have a common law duty to protect lives and that an anonymous 911 call is sufficient to invoke that duty, consequently, the police were justified in forcibly entering into the private home.

Background
On June 1, 1992, a 911 operator received an ""unknown trouble"" call where the phone was disconnected before the operator heard any voice. The call was traced to Vincent Godoy's house and four police officers were dispatched to his house. The policy of the police is to treat ""unknown trouble"" calls as high priority. The officers talked with Godoy who told them that there was no problem. One officer asked if they could come inside. Godoy tried to close the door but the officer put his foot in the door and they all entered. The officers found a battered woman sobbing. They arrested Godoy for assault.

In the Ontario Court of Appeal, the court found that the police acted validly based on their common law duty to prevent serious injury and protect lives. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Lamer, for the Court, found that police possessed a general duty to protect lives even outside of criminal situations. Where there are reasonable and probable grounds the police are allowed entering a private dwelling in order to fulfill their duty. Here, the police could not have had reasonable and probable grounds based solely on the phone call. However, once they investigated further they were able to establish a reasonable and probable ground which allowed them to enter.

72,463,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type3,"Carl Henry Vogt (February 19, 1895 – May 12, 1956), known professionally as Louis Calhern, was an American stage and screen actor. For portraying Oliver Wendell Holmes in the film The Magnificent Yankee (1950), he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Early life
Calhern was born Carl Henry Vogt in Brooklyn, New York, in 1895, the son of Eugene Adolf Vogt and Hubertina Friese Vogt, both of whom immigrated to New York from Germany. He had one known sibling, a sister. His father was a tobacco dealer. His family left New York while he was in elementary school  and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he was raised. While playing high school football, a stage manager from a touring theatrical stock company noticed the tall, handsome youth, and hired him as a bit player. Another source states ""Grace George hired his entire high school football team as supers for a Shakespearean play."" Due to the anti-German sentiment during World War I, he thought it wise to change his Teutonic given name. His stage name is an amalgam of his hometown of St. Louis and his first and middle names, Carl and Henry (Calhern).

Stage
Just before World War I, Calhern decided to return to New York to pursue an acting career. He began as a prop boy and bit player with various touring and burlesque companies. He became a matinee idol by virtue of a play titled Cobra.

Calhern's Broadway credits include:

 Roger Bloomer (1923)
 The Song and Dance Man (1923–1924)
 Cobra (1924)
 In a Garden (1925–1926)

 The Wooden Dish (1955)

Military service
Calhern's burgeoning career was interrupted by World War I; he served in France in the 143rd Field Artillery of the United States Army.

Film

Calhern began working in silent films for director Lois Weber in the early 1920s; the most notable being The Blot (1921). A newspaper article commented: ""The new arrival in stardom is Louis Calhern, who, until Miss Weber engaged him to enact the leading male role in What's Worth While?, had been playing leads in the Morosco Stock company of Los Angeles.""

In 1923, Calhern left the movies, deciding to devote his career entirely to the stage, but returned to the screen in the sound era. In films he was primarily cast as a character actor, while he continued to play leading roles on the stage. Among Calhern's notable portrayals were as the partner in crime to Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis in 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), as Ambassador Trentino in the Marx Brothers comedy Duck Soup (1933), and as the spy boss of Cary Grant in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (1946).

Calhern was acclaimed for three diverse roles that he appeared in at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1950: a singing role as Buffalo Bill in the film version of the musical Annie Get Your Gun; as a double-crossing lawyer and sugar-daddy to Marilyn Monroe in John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle; and his Oscar-nominated performance as Oliver Wendell Holmes in The Magnificent Yankee (re-creating his role from the Broadway stage). He was also praised for his portrayal of the title role in the John Houseman production of Julius Caesar (adapted from the Shakespeare play) in 1953, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. 

Calhern played the role of the devious George Caswell, the manipulative board member of Tredway Corporation, in the 1954 production of Executive Suite, followed by the role of a jaded, acerbic high school teacher in The Blackboard Jungle (1955). His performance as Uncle Willie in High Society (1956), a musical remake of The Philadelphia Story, was his final film appearance.

Personal life
Calhern was married four times: Ilka Chase from 1926 to 1927, Julia Hoyt from 1927 to 1932, Natalie Schafer from 1933 to 1942, and Marianne Stewart from 1946 to 1955. All four marriages ended in divorce. 

Calhern battled alcoholism for much of his adult life; as a result, he lost several important screen and stage roles. According to former wife Schafer, Calhern's inability to overcome his addiction ended their marriage. While he was willing to consult doctors, she said Calhern refused to attend Alcoholics Anonymous because he was an atheist and considered AA to be a religious organization. Calhern ultimately overcame his alcohol addiction by the late 1940s.

Death
Calhern died at age 61 of a sudden heart attack in Nara, Japan, while there to film The Teahouse of the August Moon. He was replaced in the film by Paul Ford, who had played Calhern's role in the original Broadway production. Calhern was cremated and is interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

6,464,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type7,"Abraham Lincoln High School (also known as Lincoln High Educational Complex, Lincoln High School, or simply Lincoln), is an urban public high school in San Diego, California, United States. It is part of the San Diego Unified School District. It serves approximately 2100-2700 students in grades 9–12 in the K-12 education system. It is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Southeast San Diego, part of the Encanto neighborhoods.  It was named after President Abraham Lincoln.

Opened in 1949 and originally serving middle school students, Lincoln was converted into a high school in 1955. The original buildings were demolished and rebuilt during 2003–2007.

The school has produced several nationally recognized popular sports figures.

Lincoln High School is currently divided into four small academies. The centers' themes were the result of a 2005 parent survey.

Lincoln Center for Social Justice
Lincoln Center for the Arts
Lincoln Center for Science and Engineering
Lincoln Center for Public Safety

In particular, the Center for Social Justice  is educating San Diego's increasing activist culture. On Tuesday, February 10, 2009 a coalition of Lincoln High School along with Mission Bay High School, and several other schools including UC San Diego and San Diego State University sent hundreds of students, parents and teachers into the streets in support of banning weapons training in San Diego schools. The movement is reminiscent of the 1969/1970 Lincoln Walkouts which lasted for 10 days and resulted in the district's first Black principal.

Construction of facilities in the 2000s
Expansion of the school was done on existing facilities until 2003.  On September 24, 2003, Lincoln's cafeteria was the first building to be demolished.  The entire campus (with the exception of the gym) and a few homes nearby were eventually razed to make way for construction of the new campus.  This was a result of an elected ballot proposition approved by its citizens. During construction many students were displaced and relocated to other high schools in the District.  The campus expanded with additional acquisition of property through eminent domain.

Before demolition, the campus had been infamous for its gang activity, particularly when graduating senior Willie James Jones Jr. was gunned down in 1994, just days before he was to matriculate to the prestigious Cornell University, hitting headlines and sparking outrage all over the San Diego media.  The school also had been criticized for being behind academically, and there remained some skepticism in the community about Lincoln's reopening over those criticisms.  Soon after Jones's death, Pastor Roy Dixon was told by the principal that ""kids entered Lincoln with extremely low reading levels and could not perform academically.""

Lincoln High School was reopened on September 4, 2007.  The new  campus was designed by architect and Lincoln alum, Joseph Martinez (class of 1966), and rebuilt by many Lincoln alumni who took part in construction of the school.  At a cost of $129 million, Lincoln is currently the most expensive campus in the San Diego Unified School District.

In its newly rebuilt form, Lincoln now features major improvements such as an increased student enrollment capacity of 2,700 (from an average of 800 students during Lincoln's last few years before demolition), a 790-seat performing arts center, a football and track stadium that can seat 3,700, and other facilities for press and concessions.  The improvements addressed concerns over Lincoln's previously dilapidated and outdated facilities, proper allocation of rooms per grade enrollment, and the increasing high school enrollment pressures of the neighborhood, in addition to public input and suggestions given by members of the Lincoln community.  The site also features modern, state-of-the-art building design and facilities specialized to the curriculum.

Academic program
The Lincoln-Gompers Redevelopment Committee noted the paramount importance of holding Lincoln's students, often from groups historically under-served by the public education system, to high expectations within a rigorous, standards-based curriculum framework.

Upon Lincoln's re-opening, all students were required to fulfill the ""A-G"" subject area requirements for admission to the University of California, two years before San Diego Unified codified an ""A-G for all"" policy under then-superintendent, Terry Grier. Due in part to the uneven diaspora of its middle school students to charters and bussing to schools north of the I-8, Lincoln was privately criticized within the district for being ""too ambitious"" in its academic aspirations in 2007, because data indicated many incoming first-year students to Lincoln were often under-prepared in comparison to their grade-level peers in key academic disciplines such as English and math. The rationale was that the ""A-G"" requirement (the mandatory number and scope of college-prep classes), thrust upon students unused to such daunting expectations, would lead to grade inflation or lowered standards of instruction in college-prep classes in order to avoid massive amounts of Ds and Fs. As such, early on Lincoln High earned a reputation among parents and students for the difficulty of its core content area classes, particularly among students used to straight-As in middle school. The high expectations are most pronounced in Lincoln's Advanced Placement program, as well as in its AP-preparatory 9th and 10th grade math, science, and English courses; there are a correspondingly high number of Ds and Fs, mostly among first-semester 9th grade and 10th grade transfer students unused to such demands. Incoming Lincoln students can expect homework 3-5 nights a week in each of these core classes and must have an attendance rate of 95% in order to be successful. Lincoln partly addresses parents' and students' concerns over student sustainability in the staff recruiting parameters, which emphasize a commitment to supporting students to meet high but attainable academic goals.

 97% of the teachers at Lincoln are rated ""highly qualified"" under NCLB for their licensed subject area.
 Over 80% have either a master's, PhD or EdD.
 The average classroom experience of a Lincoln teacher is 10.1 years.

In addition, a systemic structure was to create a Response to Intervention (RTI) model of instructional support, with counselor positions dedicated to identifying and supporting at-risk students, primarily 9th and 10th graders. In developing curriculum, the teaching staff put special attention to data-driven instruction and culturally responsive content, with a heavy emphasis on teacher professional development. Each content area teacher attends monthly PLC (Professional Learning Community) meetings, a Center-specific meeting, and there is a minimum day each month meant to examine diagnostic and formative assessment data in course-alike groups in order to guide, target, and enhance instructional practices.

Lincoln's fledgling academic program grew from five AP (Advanced Placement) class offerings in 2007 to 18 offerings in 2010, including AP Environmental Science, AP Language and AP Literature, AP Calculus and AP Music.

Lincoln offers a broad range of support and academic enrichment for students:
 A community partnership with the Old Globe, San Diego's prestigious regional theater, which has performed several full-scale productions at the Lincoln Performing Arts Center, including Welcome to Arroyo's, and Mo'olelo Performing Arts company, a nationally recognized theatre company which ""uncover[s] and research[es] stories within different communities and bring them to life on stage, using all the artistic and technical elements of the performing arts.""
 Lincoln High partners (along with charter Gompers Preparatory Academy and The Preuss School) with the University of California, San Diego, a world-renowned public research university. The partnership school concept is specifically designed to connect UCSD students and resources with first-generation collegiate applicants, at-risk, and minority students in Southeast San Diego.
 Resource teachers are tasked in support of teachers and students in each of the following content areas: English language arts, math/technology, science, and history, in addition to an English-Language Learner Resource Teacher.
 Gear-Up, a ""discretionary grant program [designed] to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.""
AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) program
JROTC (Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps)
Campus-wide implementation of SpringBoard, the CollegeBoard's official Pre-AP English Language Arts curriculum
Heterogenous classes (i.e. no honors or remedial sections) except for ESL or AP classes. The rationale behind inclusive, mixed-ability classrooms was that minority students were historically often ""tracked"" into less-demanding classes when their school perceived that they lacked academic or linguistic preparation, further exacerbating the ""achievement gap"" — aka the learning ""opportunity gap"" — between Black and Latino, and White and Asian students. To combat this systemic inequity, Lincoln's instructional philosophy is based, in part, on ""differentiation,"" the idea that all students benefit within a classroom where there are a range of proficiencies represented, as long as a skilled teacher modifies instruction based on content, process, or product in response to the students' learning readiness, interest, and learning profile.
 A New Arrival Center in the 600 building, for students new to the country (i.e. < 12 months). Lincoln is one of only three schools in SDUSD to host a New Arrival Center. Many of these students, such as refugees from Somalia and Southwest Asia, have never experienced education a formal school setting, and benefit from mutual acculturation with other immigrant students, as well as from learning English together. Student spend four periods a day with a specially trained teacher, learning basic skills and knowledge necessary for success in American society, and can take P.E. and one elective course within a mainstream classroom. Students are exited into mainstream classroom as soon as they pass the CELDT (California English Language Development Test) and when they are determined to be sufficiently acclimated to the school culture in order to be successful in mainstream classes.

 A robust arts small school program, including theatre, dance, choral music, instrumental music, band, and multimedia classes. 9th grade students entering Center for the Arts enroll in an Intro to Arts ""wheel"" course unique to San Diego Unified, where students rotate within six-week preparatory courses in Choral Music, Visual Media, and Theatre/Drama for one 18-week semester. 9th grade arts students then select an arts ""focus"" and immediately enroll in intermediate and, after their first year, advanced courses. Introduction to arts courses are meant to pique students' interest, but to also introduce the rigor of a specific artistic discipline; for example, 9th grade Intro to Drama students are expected to develop, write, rehearse and deliver a live performance of at least two original monologues within a ten-day  period.

Demographics
Lincoln High School is located in Lincoln Park, a historically working-class, African-American neighborhood in Southeast San Diego. Beginning in the late 1990s and accelerating in the early 2000s up until its closure in 2002, Lincoln High's demographics began to shift as Latino, Vietnamese, Samoan, Filipino, Laotian and other ethnic groups moved in, attracted by residential and business redevelopment, competitive home and rental pricing, close proximity to transportation hubs such as the Market Street Trolley Station, and quick access to the I-805 and CA-94. When Lincoln reopened in 2007, for the first time Latino students were the majority, reflecting the change in the demographics of the neighborhood but also soon coinciding with the severe economic downturn of 2008, which contributed significantly to student mobility. The student population has since stabilized at approximately 2100 students. As of the 2009 school year, the student body was composed of approximately 35% African-American, 55% Hispanic or Latino, and 10% other groups. Despite shifts in racial, residential, and income demographics since its reopening, over 85% of Lincoln High's students still qualify for free- and reduced-lunch programs.

Academic performance
Since 2007, Lincoln students have achieved double-digit gains on state test scores every year, with the largest increase coming in the 2008–09 school year. Starting with a baseline score of 540 in 2007–8 school year (the first year of testing), Lincoln students were expected by the State of California to gain only 13 points on the California Standards Test (CST) in the 2008–09 school year; instead students gained 47 points, to push the API (Academic Performance Index) growth score to 587. Despite these gains, in 2010 Lincoln was unable to avoid falling into ""Program Improvement"" under the NCLB (No Child Left Behind) federal legislation guidelines because it failed to meet mandated proficiency targets with student subgroups two years in a row, notably English Language Learners (ELLs). According to NCLB, 100% percent of students were predicted to be proficient in English and math by 2014.  As of the end of 2011, Lincoln's API has grown to a current score of 617, a growth of 77 points in 4 years.

Notable sports achievements

2009-10 basketball season
This marked the third season on the Lincoln Hornets basketball program. Coming off of a 20–11 record with a loss in the semi-finals to Oceanside High School, expectations were high for the Hornet program. In 2009–2010, the Hornets, led by Head Coach Jason Bryant and assistants Anthony Tucker, Mark McCann, Rhett Butler, Glen Worley, Jeff Harper, Victor Dean Sr. and Earl Woolridge, went on to a 29–2 record winning the Western League, a Division II CIF Championship, and the State Championship, defeating St. Francis of Mountain View 74–59. The Hornets were led by UCLA standout Norman Powell and Victor Dean Jr., who both scored 24 points in the game. Dean was MVP for the game.

2010-11 basketball season
Coming off of a state championship, the Hornets were ranked #1 in San Diego, #7 in California and #10 in the Western Region. By February, the Hornets achieved a #1 ranking in the state and #7 in the nation, according to ESPN and USA Today. Lincoln was the first San Diego High School basketball team to be #1 ranked in California. The Hornets went on to a 31–2 record, repeating as champions in the Western League and CIF Division II. Lincoln advanced to the state southern regional before falling to Summit High School by four points.

2010-11 football season
In the regular season the Hornets posted a 4–6 record, which was good enough to land them a spot in the playoffs. Their first match-up was against Castle Park High School, who ended up losing 66–0. Lincoln played Ramona High School in the quarter-finals and won 41–28. As they met up with St. Augustine High School in the semi-finals, the Hornets had Barley won 29–26. In the championship game against Cathedral Catholic High School, the Hornets lost 24–7. Making it to the championship was a big milestone for a program only four years old. The Hornets' Head Football Coach, Ron Hamamoto, was transferred the next season to Monte Vista High School, which was in the same Division in CIF as Lincoln. Former NFL player David Dunn took over.

2012-13 football season
The Hornets posted a 7–3 record in the regular season, making it Lincoln's best record since they re-opened in 2007. Their 7–3 record was good enough to land them the 4th seed spot in the CIF playoffs. After their bye week they faced Point Loma, who they beat 21–17. In the semi-finals they played undefeated Olympian. The Hornets won 20-7 and went on to play Ramona in the CIF Division III Championship. The Hornets won 42-14 and took their first championship title since the school re-opened, and its first championship title since 1987.

19th-century Norwegian businesspeopleThe de Havilland DH 112 Venom is a British post-war single-engined jet aircraft developed and manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. Much of its design was derived from the de Havilland Vampire, the firm's first jet-powered combat aircraft.

The Venom entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), where it was used as a single-seat fighter-bomber and two-seat night fighter. A dedicated model for aerial reconnaissance was also operated by the Swiss Air Force. The Venom functioned as an interim stage between the first generation of British jet fighters – straight-wing aircraft powered by centrifugal flow engines such as the Gloster Meteor and the Vampire – and later swept wing, axial flow-engined combat aircraft, such as the Hawker Hunter and de Havilland Sea Vixen. Accordingly, the type had a relatively short service life in the RAF, being withdrawn from frontline operations by the service in 1962 as a result of the introduction of more capable designs. However, it was used in combat during the Suez Crisis, the Malayan Emergency, and the Aden Emergency.

The Venom proved to be popular on the export market, being sold in substantial numbers to Iraq, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela. The Swiss Air Force was the last active military operator of the Venom, retiring their last examples during 1983. Large numbers of ex-military Venoms have since been acquired by private entities and several have continued to fly, performing aerial displays at various air shows, while many examples have been preserved in static display conditions in museums and as gate guardians. A specialised derivative, the Sea Venom, was produced as a navalised version of the aircraft suitable for carrier operations.

Development

Origins

In 1948, de Havilland proposed a development of the Vampire, furnished with a thinner wing and a more powerful engine, to serve as a high altitude fighter, designated as the Vampire FB 8. The design gradually shifted, becoming the DH 112 Venom, in order to fill an Air Ministry requirement, Specification F.15/49, which sought a fast, manoeuvrable and capable fighter-bomber to replace the Royal Air Force's (RAF) existing Vampires in that capacity. From the onset, the envisioned role had been intended as an interim fighter-bomber, while the development of aircraft capable of even greater performance had already been anticipated by the service.

Although generally similar in appearance to the preceding Vampire, sharing the distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure, the Venom was a completely new design. As originally designed, it was powered by the de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine, which was capable of generating 4,850lb of thrust, considerably more powerful than the earlier de Havilland Goblin that had been used on the Vampire. The Venom adopted a wing designed with a leading edge sweepback of 17.6 degrees, a minimised thickness/chord ratio reduced from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, while the trailing edge was straight; a pair of optionally-fitted wing tip tanks were also designed to be fitted without any negative impact on the aircraft's overall combat maneuvering capability.

In order to test elements of the new design, a single Vampire F 1 was converted and outfitting with the new Ghost engine. On 2 September 1949, the first Venom prototype, VV612, performed its maiden flight at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, piloted by John Derry. In May 1950, following the end of company trials, the prototype was delivered to RAF Boscombe Down for official trials by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). In the course of these trials, the aircraft proved capable of satisfactory performance, including the besting of some contemporary fighters during mock combat, while some minor faults were also uncovered. On 23 May 1950, the second prototype, VV613, officially joined the development programme; it was delivered to the A&AEE for further trials on 3 April 1951.

The first six production Venom also participated in trials performed by both de Havilland and the A&AEE. On 21 April 1952, the first delivery of a production-standard Venom, a single-seat fighter-bomber, occurred to the Central Fighter Establishment, where it was used for a full service evaluation prior to the type being cleared for active service. During 1952, the initial production model entered operational service with the RAF as the Venom FB 1. A total of 375 of this initial model were constructed.

Further development

On 22 August 1950, an improved Venom, the NF.2 night fighter, performed its first flight, piloted by John Derry. de Havilland had developed it from the single seat ground attack-oriented Venom to serve as a replacement for the Vampire NF 10. For this variant, the fuselage was redesigned to accommodate a two-man crew, (pilot and navigator/radar operator), seated in a side-by-side configuration, and an airborne interception radar installed in the extended nose. During late 1953, the Venom NF.2 entered squadron service, after being delayed to resolve minor problems that had been discovered. Specifically, preliminary handling trials had revealed unsatisfactory performance in poor weather conditions.

The Venom NF.2 was modified after being involved in several accidents in which pilots had difficulty making night-time approaches. Changes included the adoption of jettisonable clear canopies and alterations to the flight control surfaces, and the altered aircraft were re-designated NF.2As. The Venom NF.2 was soon followed by the NF 3, which was the ultimate night fighter variant of the Venom. It incorporated further improvements, including power-actuated ailerons and an improved air interception radar. In 1953, the Venom NF 3 performed its first flight; it entered operational service with the RAF during June 1955.

The final Venom for the RAF was the single-seat FB.4 which first flew on 29 December 1953. It entered service in 1955 and 250 were built. It was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust de Havilland Ghost 103 turbojet engine. It was the first Venom to be fitted with an ejector seat, as well as being furnished with redesigned tail surfaces and hydraulically-powered ailerons. The new rudder design prevented excessive yaw and eliminated incidents of rudder locking at low speeds. The FB 4 variant was the first to be compatible with the underwing fuel tanks.

The majority of the type's production was conducted by de Havilland themselves. Following the completion of an initial batch of 15 production Venoms, manufacturing was transferred from de Havilland's Hatfield facility to their larger production plant at Hawarden Airport. On 26 July 1952, the first Hawarden-built Venom was delivered to the RAF. In addition, the construction effort was augmented by numbers of Venom FB.1, FB.4 and NF.51 aircraft that were produced by Fairey Aviation at Manchester (Ringway) Airport. At one point, the production of further Venoms at the Bristol Aeroplane Company's Filton facility was considered but was ultimately not pursued. During the early 1950s, the prospects for Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione producing the type under license were explored; these did not materialise however. 

Due to substantial demand from the Swiss Air Force, a license production arrangement was established with a consortium of Swiss aviation manufacturers in 1953, who did produce large numbers of Venoms. In the early 1970s Swiss Venoms were equipped with a new extended nose to add space for the addition of a ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, an Identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder and a SAAB BT-9K ballistic computer for its ground attack ordnance.

Design
The de Havilland Venom was a jet-propelled combat aircraft, featuring a distinctive twin-boom tail and composite wood/metal structure. Originally developed as a ground-attack fighter, it served as an interceptor as well. It possessed a favourable rate of climb and other positive characteristics that lent itself well to combat operations, and represented a significant advance over the preceding Vampire. It was a sound ground attack aircraft, possessing good maneuverability, steadiness, endurance, handling, and a range of compatible stores. The Venom's manoeuvrability even gave it an edge against many dogfighters of the era, although its limited top speed proved to be a weakness in this role. Early issues, such as a rear spar weakness and flash fires due to the ingestion of vented fuel by the engine air intakes under some conditions, were quickly identified and overcome.

The Venom FB 1 was armed with four nose-mounted 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk V autocannons and could carry either two 1,000 lb (approx 450 kg) bombs or eight RP-3 60 lb (27 kg) air-to-ground rocket projectiles – the heavier bombs being an improvement over the Vampire FB 5. For additional range, each of the wing tips could accommodate the installation of a 75gal tip tank, freeing up the underwing stores positions for other stores and munitions, these were not jettisonable during flight. When installed, the tip tanks had the effect of improving the aircraft's roll rate, which was lower than many of its contemporaries. Early production Venoms commonly suffered from weaknesses within the wing structure, leading to flight limitations and warning markings being applied to distinguish them from typical aircraft.

The Venom FB 1 was powered by a single 4,850 lbf (21.6 kN) thrust Ghost 48 Mk.1 turbojet engine; later marks were equipped with increasingly powerful models. The engine was ignited using explosive cartridges, known as Coffman engine starters; at the time, many operators were not previously familiar with such means of start up. Early production models lacked ejection seats, which was subject to official criticism; in response, later production models were furnished with them. The airframe itself had a relatively short life due to having been designed for its role as a short term interim aircraft pending development of what would become the Hawker Hunter; in Swiss service, where the type was subject to a lengthy service life, several strengthening modifications were performed to more than double its viable lifespan. It was known for its simplicity in construction and relative cost-effectiveness, which contributed to its popularity to export customers.

Operational history

In August 1952, No. 11 Squadron become the first overseas squadron to convert to the Venom in exchange for their existing Vampires inventory; No. 11 was responsible for conducting the type's operational service trials for the service. Upon their introduction to service, none of the single-seat fighter-bomber Venoms were deployed to home-based squadrons; priority was given to overseas forces, such as the Second Tactical Air Force stationed in Germany as well as those stationed in hotter climates where the benefits of the more powerful engine were most felt, such as Cyprus, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

During September 1952, the Venom participated in its first NATO training operation, Exercise Mainbrace. In mid-1953, a second Venom wing, consisting of Nos. 14, 98 and 118 Squadrons, was formed at RAF Fassberg, Lower Saxony; a third wing, comprising No.s 16, 94, and 145 Squadrons, was also formed at RAF Celle, Lower Saxony, during the following year. In this capacity, the Venom was only operated for a short time, those squadrons stationed at RAF Faßberg transitioned to the Hawker Hunter in 1955, while those at RAF Celle were disbanded in 1957.

Throughout the mid-1950s, Venoms were dispatched to the furthest corners of the British Empire, being typically used to replace the Vampire in the fighter-bomber role. In August 1955, a flight of four Venoms conducted a 10,000 flight from RAF Habbaniya, Iraq to Wingfield Aerodrome, South Africa and back; while on the return leg of this journey, a speed record was set on the Cape Town-Pretoria route, covering the 807-mile distance in 1 hour 23 minutes.

On 6 May 1953, the first of the Venom night fighters was delivered to the RAF. From 1955 onwards, an improved model of the night fighter, the Venom NF.3, was introduced to squadron service. However, the night fighter Venom had only a relatively brief career with the RAF, having been procured to serve as an interim solution while more capable designs were developed. Accordingly, in 1957, the RAF's night fighter Venoms began to be withdrawn in favour of the newly introduced Gloster Javelin twin-engined all-weather fighter. In the night fighter role, the Venom was also adopted by export customers; the Swedish Air Force adopted the type as their principal night fighter in 1955 and operated three squadrons in this capacity.

RAF Venoms saw action during the Malayan Emergency, which took place between 1948 and 1960, although these aircraft did not commence operations until the mid-1950s with Nos. 45 and 60 Squadrons. While there, the Venom supported counterinsurgency operations against Communist guerrillas as part of Operation Firedog, the codename for RAF operations in Malaya. By 15 November 1957, the day on which the Venom was withdrawn from combat in the theatre, the type had conducted more than 300 strikes against guerillas. Several Venoms were lent to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for use during the same conflict, being operated by No. 14 Squadron RNZAF.

The Venom also saw combat service during the Suez Crisis during late 1956. The type was operated by Nos. 6, 8 and 249 Squadrons, flying from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus. The Anglo-French invasion, codenamed Operation Musketeer, took place in response to the nationalisation of the Suez Canal by Egypt's leader, General Nasser. The air war began on 31 October 1956. The Venoms attacked a variety of military installations on the ground; only a single RAF Venom was lost throughout the crisis.

From 1956 onwards, Middle Eastern-based RAF squadrons progressively received the improved Venom FB 4. Starting in 1956, RAF Venoms were deployed during the Aden Emergency, where they were used in support of counterinsurgency operations against terrorists and rebel tribesmen in Aden and Oman. In 1957, British RAF Venoms participated heavily during Jebel Akhdar War in Oman to expand the territory of the Sultanate, which was a de facto British colony, in order to gain access to oil wells in the interior parts of Oman. The RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958 targeting insurgents, mountain top villages, water channels and crops in a war that remained under low profile. As the conflict progressed, squadrons equipped with the Venom were reequipped, mainly by the English Electric Canberra; in 1960, the final squadron in the region that used the type was reequipped with the Hawker Hunter.

Outside of the RAF, the Swiss Air Force were the most prolific user of the Venom. In addition to the domestic production of 136 ground attack-orientated models and its Ghost engine to power them, Switzerland also produced a dedicated aerial reconnaissance variant of the aircraft, which were outfitted with specially modified underwing fuel tanks that had automated cameras installed in the forward section. Swiss Venoms were also subject to multiple improvement and upgrade programmes, including life extension modifications, the addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio sets, and an improved license-built bombsight.

In 1962, all of the remaining Venoms in RAF service were withdrawn from first-line duties, having proven their worth in a variety of locations across the world, in peace and war, and in some of the most difficult climates the RAF has ever faced. The last non-RAF Venoms to leave active service were the aircraft in service with the Swiss Air Force, the last of which being retired from combat duties during the latter part of 1983. About 10–20 Venoms continue to fly as of 2017, performing at various air shows, while a number of examples are preserved in museums in the United Kingdom and abroad, in non-flying, static display condition.

Aircraft on display

The Venom has been preserved in significant numbers, mainly due to its longevity with the Swiss Air Force. In the UK, a number of Sea Venoms are preserved, along with examples of the NF 3 and Swiss-built FB.50 and 54. In Sweden, two examples of the NF.51 are preserved. There are many survivors in Switzerland, and other Swiss aircraft are scattered throughout Europe. One such aircraft is preserved in the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim, although in the colours of the Iraqi Air Force. In Australia, a number of Sea Venom FAW.53s have also survived. Venezuela has the only complete surviving British-built single-seat Venom.

Polish Aviation Museum (PAL) has British-built Sea Venom, which was used for experiments at de Havilland and Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, and then was transferred to Imperial War Museum, which sold it to PAL in 2013.

Although the Venom was, for a time, a popular and cheap warbird the number of airworthy aircraft is dwindling. There are two in the UK and one in New Zealand that fly regularly. World Heritage Air Museum fleet owns 1 Venom (tail number N202DM) and operated an additional Venom (tail number N747J). N747J crashed on 20 July 2018, while preparing for the EAA AirVenture Show, killing the pilot, World Heritage Aviation Museum co-founder, Martin J. Tibbits. All are licence-built Swiss examples.

Timeline

The COVID-19 pandemic in Japan can be divided into five waves based on the genome sequence of the country's COVID-19 virus. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan) (NIID) has determined from its genetic research that the COVID-19 variant of the first wave is derived from the Wuhan type that is prevalent in patients from China and East Asia.  After entering Japan in January through travellers and returnees from China, the virus resulted in numerous infection clusters across the country before moving towards its disappearance in March. Japanese medical surveillance confirmed its first case of the virus on 16 January in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had returned from Wuhan.

The first wave was followed by a second one that originated from a COVID-19 variant of the European type that is traced back to early patients from France, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Japanese medical surveillance detected the second wave on 26 March when the government's expert panel concluded the likelihood of a new outbreak caused by travellers and returnees from Europe and the United States between 11 March and 23 March.  The NIID has established that the majority of viruses spreading in Japan since March is the European type. This has led it to conclude that the data ""strongly suggests"" that the Japanese government has succeeded in containing the Wuhan variant and that it is the European variant that is spreading across the country.

July–September 2020

July 
At the beginning of July, The Tokyo Metropolitan Government confirmed 67 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, the highest daily figure since 87 were reported on 4 May. Ten people were confirmed in Osaka Prefecture, since 12 people who had two spots per day, and only about a month and a half since 13 May. It was found that the number of people infected at night in downtown areas is increasing in Ikebukuro in Toshima Ward in addition to Shinjuku City. Of the 67 people infected in Tokyo on the 1st, 27 people were involved in the night town, of which 13 were in Ikebukuro, more than 10 in Shinjuku.  When Minister Suga Yoshihide asked at the press conference on the possibility of re-releasing the emergency declaration, he said, ""As the rate of increase increases again, there is a possibility that it will be released in the worst case.""

On 2 July, Tokyo reported 107 new cases of the novel coronavirus Thursday, an alarming uptick that residents fear may push the central government to declare another state of emergency. It was the most, yet again, since the state of emergency was lifted in late May and the first time the number has hit triple digits in two months. Unfortunately for people within Kyushu region, Kagoshima announced on 2 July that it has newly confirmed the infection with a new coronavirus in 9 men and women. On the other hand, Fukuoka Prefecture announced on the 2nd that four new coronavirus infections were confirmed. In terms of infected people, over 190 new cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed nationwide, it was the largest in post-emergency declaration released on 25 May.

At the end of April, it was a little less than 4,000, but after that it increased sharply and exceeded 10,000 on three days later, May 21.

Among recent cases, many of the infected are young people in their 20s and 30s and those who have visited the nightlife areas in the capital, with many remaining asymptomatic. But despite the spike, the number of serious cases is declining and there was no need to reinstate the state of emergency that was lifted on 25 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Preventive measures have already pushed Japan's economy into a recession in the first quarter, with a deeper contraction expected in the April–June quarter.

NHK reported on the 11 July that the Japanese government is coordinating to allow those who are eligible to stay in Japan, including international students, to re-enter the country on condition that they undergo COVID-19 tests even if they temporarily return home. According to the broadcast, the Japanese government is seeking to allow foreigners who are eligible to stay, such as international students or functional trainees, to re-enter the country on the condition that they receive a Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) to check if they are infected with COVID-19. If the Japanese government's policy is finalized, Korean students who returned to Korea during the winter vacation while studying in Japan will be able to re-enter Japan and continue their studies. However, according to the contents of the broadcast, it seems that students who have returned to their home country or are currently staying in Japan will continue to be banned from re-entry.

The Asahi Shimbun reported on the 12 July that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered ""consulting with Taiwan first"" to avoid criticism from conservatives over the easing of entry regulations for Korean and Chinese businessmen in connection with the ""COVID-19 infection incident."" According to The Asahi Shimbun, when the Japanese government decided in June to ease entry restrictions for officials from companies in four countries—Vietnam, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand—a kind of agreement was reached within the government: ""South Korea, China and Taiwan next."" Abe then ordered Taiwan to do so first in relation to countries subject to the second round of entry deregulation. The Asahi Shimbun analysed that the prime minister's supporters expect a hard-line stance against South Korea and China. Against this backdrop, a policy of ""starting negotiations almost simultaneously, but ending negotiations in Taiwan"" has emerged. It also decided to ""water down"" Korean, Chinese and Taiwanese issues, which have drawn keen attention, by including Asian countries such as Brunei, Myanmar and Malaysia, where the COVID-19 is stable. Accordingly, the Japanese government plans to begin consultations with 10 countries, including South Korea, in the middle of this month on easing immigration restrictions.

The opposition party immediately ordered the government to ""re-declare the emergency."" Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, said, ""If the infection expands, it will be a failure due to the failure of politics to do what it needs to do.

On the other hand, the Japanese government is sticking to the position of Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga on Thursday, saying, ""I don't think we're in a situation where we're going to announce an emergency again soon."" About 80 per cent of the confirmed patients are in their 20s and 30s, and the rate of bed use (about 20 per cent) is still available. Above all, the Japanese government is concerned about the negative impact on the economy if the emergency declaration is accompanied by a request to refrain from going out or taking a break. Some in the Japanese government said that it was Tokyo's problem. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a lecture in Chitose, Hokkaido on 11 July, ""It is no overstatement to say that the issue is Tokyo's problem undoubtedly."" It's a Tokyo-centred problem,"" he said.

With hundreds of coronavirus infections in Japan for the fourth day in a row, the government has launched a campaign to encourage travelling domestically in Japan, raising concerns over the spread of the virus.

Local media, including NHK, also pointed out that ""in large cities such as Tokyo, where the number of infected people is increasing, there are voices concerned that the population movement will increase and spread."" Legal circles are recruiting plaintiffs and lawyers for class action suits against the project under the name of ""Stop Go To Travel."" As the controversy grew, Yastoshi Nishimura, Minister of Economic revitalization in charge of COVID-19 response, held a press conference on 12 July and explained, ""We must proceed with the campaign while paying attention to the spread of the infection. We can thoroughly prevent infection and promote the compatibility of economic and social activities."" He also stressed, ""If you are in bad shape, please refrain from going out, and refrain from crossing the prefecture.""

In the face of the continued spread of COVID-19, the Japanese government has decided to exclude trips from or arriving from Tokyo, where the number of confirmed people has soared. ""We will thoroughly implement measures to prevent infection,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at the prime minister's residence, adding that his policy of carefully resuming economic activities under the cooperation of the people remains unchanged.

As the re-expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic has become serious, the hosting of the Tokyo Olympics, which was postponed until 23 July next year, has become uncertain.

In April, he also mentioned the possibility of ""cancellation"" rather than ""acting"" the Olympics. Chairman Mori expressed negative stances on both the Olympic re-enactment and the potential for unrelated spectators. He said, “It is difficult to reperform because the Winter Olympics in Beijing, China in 2022, and the Paris Olympics in France in 2024 have already been decided.

The metropolitan government on Thursday again requested that establishments serving alcohol and karaoke parlors close early to prevent further spread of the virus, effective from Monday through the end of August. Koike said Friday that while the metropolitan government may ask other types of businesses to also close early, rather than a sweeping request similar to the one made during the nationwide state of emergency, it would ""pinpoint"" certain sectors and areas. Amid rising cases, the Osaka prefectural government will request establishments providing alcohol in Osaka's Minami entertainment district to temporarily shut or shorten their operating hours from Wednesday through 20 Aug, Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura said.

COVID-19"
15,467,2055-6-6 00:00:00,note_type0,"The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The qualification and final rounds took place on September 16 and 25 at the Sydney Super Dome. There were 79 competitors from 28 nations; nations competing in the team event could have up to 5 gymnasts in the vault, while other nations could have up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Alexei Nemov of Russia, the nation's first post-Soviet victory in the horizontal bar. Nemov, a bronze medalist in 1996, was the 10th man to win multiple medals in the horizontal bar. Benjamin Varonian earned France's first medal in the event since 1976 with his silver. Lee Joo-Hyung won South Korea's first medal in the event with his bronze.

Background

This was the 20th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the eight finalists from 1996 returned: gold medalist (and 1992 silver medalist) Andreas Wecker of Germany, bronze medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, and seventh-place finisher Lee Joo-Hyung of South Korea. Neither of the recent world champions (Jani Tanskanen of Finland in 1997, Jesús Carballo of Spain in 1999) competed in Sydney.

Latvia made its debut in the men's horizontal bar. The United States made its 18th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 event and the boycotted 1980 Games.

Competition format

The 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the ""7–6–5"" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a ""6–5–4"" format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, in 2000 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.

The top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 79th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.

Schedule

All times are Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10)

Seventy-nine gymnasts competed in the horizontal bar event during the qualification round on September 16. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 25. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final.

Lost BBC episodesJohn William Savidan (23 May 1902 – 8 November 1991), nicknamed ""Billy"", ""Bill"" or ""Jack"" and born in Auckland, was a New Zealand long distance runner from 1926.

At the 1930 British Empire Games in Hamilton, Ontario he won the six mile race with a time of 30:49.6 mins, despite stopping over the finish line after what he thought was the last lap and being told that there was a lap to go. The official had inadvertently turned over two discs instead of one. He beat Ernie Harper from England. In the three mile race (equivalent to 5000 meters) he did not finish.

At the 1932 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles he finished fourth in both the 5000 metre event and the 10000 metre competition.

He did not compete in the national championships in 1935 and 1936 as he was working as a stonemason and could not spend the necessary time training, but competed against two Japanese runners who were visiting New Zealand in 1937. Like Malcolm Champion before him he was then for some years Custodian at Auckland's Tepid Baths.

Films, KannadaOnika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (), is a Trinidadian-born rapper, singer, and songwriter. She is known for her versatility as an artist, her animated flow and lyricism in her rapping and her usage of alter egos and accents. Minaj first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009. She rose to fame with her debut album, Pink Friday (2010), which topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The fifth single, ""Super Bass"", reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and became the highest charting solo song by a female rapper since 2002. It also became the second song by a solo female rapper to become diamond certified in the US.

The follow-up album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), saw Minaj exploring a dance-pop and pop rap sound, and reached number one in several countries worldwide. Her third and fourth studio albums, The Pinkprint (2014) and Queen (2018), explored more personal topics and marked a return to her hip hop roots. The former's U.S. top-two second single, ""Anaconda"", became the first solo female rap video to reach one billion views on YouTube. Her collaboration with Karol G, ""Tusa"", became the longest running number one single in Argentina. In 2020, Minaj spawned her first and second U.S. number-one singles with ""Say So"" remix with Doja Cat and ""Trollz"" with 6ix9ine. With ""Trollz"", she became the first female rapper in two decades to debut at number one on the chart. She became the first female artist to hold one hundred Billboard Hot 100 entries. She has twenty U.S. top ten singles, the most for any female rapper, and is one of seven female artists to reach it. She re-released her mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty (2009) in 2021, becoming the highest debut for a female rap mixtape, debuting at number two in the U.S.

Often cited as the ""Queen of Rap"" and the ""Queen of Hip Hop"", she has also been named as one of the most influential rappers of all time by several media outlets. Minaj is also one of the best-selling artists of all time, with 100 million records sold worldwide. Billboard ranked her as the top female rapper of the 2010s, and seventh among the top female artists. Her accolades include eight American Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, six MTV Europe Music Awards, twelve BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, a Brit Award, and three Guinness World Records. In 2016, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Outside of music, her film career has included voice roles in the animated films Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) and The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019) as well as supporting roles in the comedy films The Other Woman (2014) and Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016). She is currently the most followed rapper on Instagram with over 175 million followers.

Early life
Onika Tanya Maraj was born in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on December 8, 1982. Her father was Robert Maraj (1956-2021), a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent. Her mother, Carol Maraj, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry. Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth. Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987. She has an older brother named Jelani, a younger brother named Micaiah, and a younger sister named Ming.

As a child, Minaj and her older brother, Jelani, grew up with her grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins. Minaj's mother, Carol Maraj, was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York City to attend Monroe College leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. Eventually, when Minaj was five, Carol got her first house on 147th Street in South Jamaica, Queens and migrated both Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father. Minaj recalled, ""I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.""  Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts. After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play In Case You Forget in 2001.

At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers. She said she was fired from ""at least 15 jobs"" for similar reasons. Other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street. Minaj recalls buying a BMW as a 19 year old with the money from waitressing.

Career

2004−2009: Career beginnings
Minaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called The Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of ""Bowlegged Lou""), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up. In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, ""Don't Mess With"", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. Later, Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract. Originally adopting the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that ""my real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!""

Minaj released her first mixtape, Playtime Is Over, on July 5, 2007, and her second, Sucka Free, on April 12, 2008. She released her third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009; it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV. At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. One of its tracks, ""I Get Crazy"", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After Minaj was discovered by fellow rapper Lil Wayne, she signed a recording contract with his Young Money Entertainment. That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of ""5 Star Bitch"" by Yo Gotti.

In early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with her features on ""Knockout"" and ""Up Out My Face"" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively. Minaj also appeared on ""BedRock"" and ""Roger That"" on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009). The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100; their parent album reached number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At Jay-Z's suggestion, Robin Thicke featured Minaj on his single ""Shakin' It 4 Daddy"". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post stated that, during that time, she ""became the go-to girl for artists who wanted to add some skank to their tracks without sullying themselves in the process"". Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100.

2010–2011: Breakthrough with Pink Friday

On March 29, 2010, Minaj released ""Massive Attack"". Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, Pink Friday, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance and the next single, ""Your Love"", released on June 1, became the album's lead single, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Rap Songs chart. In September, Minaj released ""Check It Out"" and ""Right Thru Me"" as follow-up singles. She also became the first female rap artist to ever perform at Yankee Stadium in 2010.

In October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's ""Monster"", with her verse receiving acclaim and many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song; The Village Voices Sean Fennessey stated that ""Monster"" was the track that announced Minaj's ""brilliance"" to most people. Complex rated Minaj's ""Monster"" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years. Lauren Nostro of Complex wrote: ""Once the beat drops, we meet the many faces of Nicki Minaj. [...] Her performance has the power, years after its release, makes you stop dead in your tracks. Altering her vocal style on every line, she bounces her wordplay from Giuseppe Zanotti shoes to Tony Matterhorn's ""Dutty Wine"" to suggesting a ménage à trois with Kanye and his then-girlfriend Amber Rose. [...] It was clear, she did her thing alongside the best in the game—she stole the show, in fact, outshined them all."" In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for her guest verse on Ludacris' song ""My Chick Bad"".

Pink Friday was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies. It had the highest sales week for a female rap album this century and second highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998).Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. The album was certified platinum in December, and eventually reached number one in the United States in February 2011. Pink Friday became the first solo album by a female rapper to go platinum in seven years.

""Moment 4 Life"" was released as the fourth single from Pink Friday shortly after the album's release. The song serves as the third single off the album, released as a single on December 7, 2010. Minaj performed ""Right Thru Me"" and ""Moment 4 Life"" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011 episode of Saturday Night Live. ""Super Bass"", the album's fifth single, was released in April 2011, and became a sleeper hit and commercial success; it ultimately peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and was eventually certified octuple-platinum in the U.S. At the time, Super Bass was the highest charting solo single by a female rapper since Missy Elliott's Work It. The music video has 900 million views on YouTube as of August 2021.

Minaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' 2011 Femme Fatale Tour. She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' ""Till the World Ends"", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a ""nip slip"" during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident. Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident attracted protest from the Parents Television Council. Despite this, Minaj continued to perform at high-profile events throughout 2011; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M, and she performed ""Super Bass"" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. In December 2011, Minaj was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Rap Album for Pink Friday. Also that year, she won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video for ""Super Bass"", marking her first VMA win.

2012–2013: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and The Re-Up

""Starships"" was released in February 2012 as the lead single from Minaj's forthcoming second album Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. The song reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and went on to become the fifth best-selling single of 2012 and one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. Minaj's crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success. Follow-up singles ""Beez in the Trap"" and ""Right by My Side"" were released shortly after. Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than planned. The album was preceded by the promotional singles ""Roman in Moscow"" and ""Stupid Hoe"". The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in June 2012. However, its mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews from music critics.

""Pound the Alarm"" and ""Va Va Voom"" were later released as the final singles from the album. Minaj and rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform the single, ""Give Me All Your Luvin'"", during the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012. Minaj was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, premiering ""Roman Holiday"" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12. Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League criticizing Minaj for bringing a fake ""Pope"" to escort her on the red carpet. The ""exorcism"" scene that was performed during her appearance was criticized as well. Catholic League president Bill Donohue called Minaj's performance ""vulgar"".

Minaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012, which was followed by the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14, 2012. Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her single ""Starships"" as ""not real hip-hop"".

The following month, Minaj voiced Steffie in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). She won awards for Best Female Video (for ""Starships"") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards. An expanded version of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, was released on November 19, 2012. That month, Minaj was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled Nicki Minaj: My Truth. She announced plans for her own record label after signing Parker Ighile, Brinx, Keisha, and Blackout Movement. In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of American Idol with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, and Randy Jackson. Throughout the show there were disagreements between Carey and Minaj. Minaj left the series at the end of the season.

2014–2017: The Pinkprint and other ventures
Minaj's first live-action theatrical film The Other Woman was filmed in spring 2013 and premiered on April 25, 2014. She played Lydia, assistant to Carly (played by Cameron Diaz). In 2013, Minaj described her then-forthcoming third album, The Pinkprint, as ""a continuation of The Re-Up with a lot more"" and said it would focus on her ""hip-hop roots"". During an MTV interview, she said that her third album would be ""next level"" and that she has ""much to talk about"".

""Pills n Potions"" was released as the lead single from The Pinkprint in May 2014. ""Anaconda"" was released in August as the second single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting single in the U.S. to date. The music video for ""Anaconda"" attracted significant controversy from conservative media and went viral upon release online; it set a 24-hour Vevo record, accumulating 19.6 million views on its first day of release, breaking the record previously held by Miley Cyrus for ""Wrecking Ball"". In December of that year, Minaj received two Grammy Award nominations, for Best Rap Song (""Anaconda"") and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (""Bang Bang"" with Jessie J and Ariana Grande).

The Pinkprint was officially released on December 15, 2014, and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 244,000 equivalent units (198,000 in pure album sales and 46,000 combined album-equivalent units and streams). Upon release, the album received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised the production and personal lyrics. At the 58th Grammy Awards, Minaj received three more Grammy Award nominations, including a second Best Rap Album nomination for The Pinkprint.

On November 9, 2014, Minaj hosted the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards at The SSE Hydro, Glasgow, Scotland. She also won the Best Hip-Hop Award for a second time. In March 2015, Minaj embarked on her third world tour entitled The Pinkprint Tour and also became the first female artist to chart four songs simultaneously in the top 10 of Billboards Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop airplay chart. At the 2015 BET Awards, Minaj won her sixth consecutive award for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist, becoming the female rapper with most wins in that category.

In August 2015, Madame Tussauds unveiled a wax figure of Minaj, which depicted her bent down on her hands and knees—the pose from the ""Anaconda"" music video. The attraction received criticism from some, including rapper Azealia Banks and The Independent, who called it ""sexist"" and ""racist"". Despite this, Minaj voiced her approval of the wax figure on social media. After numerous visitors began taking sexually suggestive photos with Minaj's statue, the museum instituted extra security. In September 2015, it was announced that Minaj would executive produce and appear in a scripted single-camera comedy series for ABC Family (now Freeform) based on her life growing up in Queens, New York City. The show was titled Nicki and the pilot episode was filmed in Minaj's hometown in January 2016. In October 2016, Minaj stated the filming was postponed for undisclosed reasons.

In May 2015, it was announced that Minaj would feature in the third installment of the Barbershop film series, alongside Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, and other original cast members. Titled Barbershop: The Next Cut, the film was released on April 15, 2016, and received critical acclaim, earning an average score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. Minaj's character in the film is a ""sassy"" hairdresser named Draya. For her performance, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Comedy.

In February 2017, Minaj was featured on Jason Derulo's single ""Swalla"", which reached the top ten in several countries, including a peak of number six in the UK singles chart. The following month, Minaj signed with the major modeling agency, Wilhelmina Models. On March 20, 2017, when her singles ""No Frauds"", ""Changed It"", and ""Regret in Your Tears"" were released simultaneously, Minaj broke the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries for a female artist, which was previously held by Aretha Franklin. The record was later surpassed by Taylor Swift in December 2020. In May, Minaj opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a medley performance that was described by Elias Leight of Rolling Stone as ""flamboyantly produced"" and ""dexterous"".

Throughout the remainder of 2017, Minaj performed guest verses on several singles, including Migos' ""MotorSport"" and Yo Gotti's ""Rake It Up"", both of which peaked inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, at numbers six and eight, respectively. She also featured on Katy Perry's ""Swish Swish"", which peaked at 46 on the chart and was certified platinum in the US and Canada.

2018–2019: Queen

Minaj announced her fourth album, Queen, on the red carpet at the 2018 Met Gala; the album was scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018, but was delayed multiple times before being released on August 10, 2018. Its lead single, ""Chun-Li"", was released on April 12, 2018, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. She performed the song on Saturday Night Live and the 2018 BET Awards. Another single, ""Barbie Tingz"", was released alongside ""Chun-Li"", but did not make the final album cut. It is, however, included on the Target version of the album. Queens second single, ""Bed"", featuring Ariana Grande, was released on June 14, 2018, alongside the album pre-order, and peaked at number 42 on the Hot 100. On July 22, 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine's single ""Fefe"", which featured Minaj, was released and debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. ""Fefe"" marked Minaj's highest bow on the chart as a featured artist at the time, besting the sixth place start of ""Bang Bang"" in 2014. It later peaked at number three on the Hot 100, and was added to Queen in the middle of its first tracking week.

The day before the album's release, Minaj launched her own Beats 1 radio show, Queen Radio. Queen debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 185,000 album-equivalent units, of which 78,000 came from pure album sales. It also debuted at number five in the UK and at number four in Australia, marking the highest debut of Minaj's career in the latter country. Upon debuting second on the Billboard 200, Minaj expressed frustration and criticized several people in a series of tweets, including Travis Scott, whose album Astroworld claimed the top spot for a second week in a row, blocking Queen from the top spot. Minaj claimed that Travis Scott sold shirts, merchandise, and ticket passes for an unnannounced tour to boost his album sales. Queen roll-out and the ensuing controversy was documented by several news outlets and commentators. Queen received generally positive reviews, with some critics taking issue with the album's length and consistency. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in January 2019, for moving over 1 million equivalent units.

On August 20, Minaj won her fourth MTV Video Music Award for the ""Chun-Li"" music video at the 35th annual ceremony. Later that month, BTS' single, ""Idol"", featuring Minaj, was released; it debuted and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the group's second highest-charting song. On October 12, 2018, British girl group Little Mix released their single featuring Minaj, ""Woman Like Me"". A music video, which features Minaj wearing ""Elizabethan ruff and not much else"", was released the same month. A BBC writer opined that the video ""tackle[s] gender stereotypes"". Minaj was featured on Tyga's song ""Dip"", which reached number 63 on the Hot 100, making her the first female artist to have 100 entries on the chart. She later attended the year-end Billboard Women in Music event, receiving the Game Changer Award for the accomplishment.

Minaj also participated in a series of music festivals. On September 2, 2018, Minaj co-headlined the annual Made in America Festival and suffered a wardrobe malfunction. In November 2018, Minaj was invited to the DWP music festival in China but did not perform due to problems with the company hosting the event. In April 2019, Minaj made a guest appearance at the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival during Ariana Grande's set and performed alongside her to their collaborations ""Side to Side"" and ""Bang Bang"". However, she experienced technical difficulties with her earpiece. Later that month, Minaj parted ways with her longtime management team after a mutual agreement.

In June 2019, Minaj released her first solo song of 2019, titled ""Megatron"". In July, she provided information on her forthcoming fifth studio album, appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon stating ""You're the first to find out ... of course there's a new album.""

The following week, ""Tusa"", Minaj's collaboration with Colombian singer Karol G, was released to streaming platforms. The track peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top of many other charts, including the ""Hot Latin Songs"" chart which made it the first song with two lead female artists to debut in such position.

2020–2021: Collaborations and Beam Me Up Scotty re-release

On May 1, 2020, American rapper Doja Cat featured Minaj on two remixes of her song ""Say So"". That week, the remix topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj's first single to reach number one on the chart. The song became the first female collaboration in six years since ""Fancy"" by Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX (2014) to peak atop the chart, and marked the first time that a song by two female rappers reached the top, with Meaghan Garvey of Billboard remarking that it ""paved the way for Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion 'WAP' a few months after"".

On June 12, 2020, 6ix9ine and Minaj released their third collaboration, ""Trollz"", which debuted atop the Hot 100, becoming Minaj's second number-one single. This made Minaj the second female rapper to debut atop the Hot 100 chart since Lauryn Hill did so in 1998 with ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"". The song dropped to 34 in its second week, making it the first single to fall over 30 positions in its second week after debuting at number one, breaking the record for largest fall from number one in the country at the time; the record was later broken by Taylor Swift's ""Willow"" which dropped to 38 after debuting atop of the chart.

In October 2021, Minaj was revealed to cameo as a host in the season six reunion of The Real Housewives of Potomac. In November 2021, her 2011 Pink Friday single ""Super Bass"" was certified Diamond by RIAA, making her the second female rapper to receive a diamond certification for a song. Minaj won the Best Hip Hop award in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2021, becoming the sixth time she has won this award. Minaj also won the ""People's Champ"" award from the hip hop magazine XXL's yearly awards. It was the only award that was fan-voted according to XXL.

2022–present: Upcoming fifth studio album

On January 27, 2022, Minaj announced a new song called ""Do We Have a Problem?"" featuring American rapper Lil Baby. It was released on February 4, along with a music video that was directed by Benny Boom and featured guest appearances from actors Joseph Sikora and Cory Hardrict. Minaj's role in the video was inspired by Angelina Jolie's performance in the 2010 film Salt. The video also teased another track titled ""Bussin"" – the track, also a collaboration with Lil Baby, was officially released a week later, on February 11.

In a promotional Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe, Minaj said her fifth studio album is ""coming very soon."" She also made an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, where she revealed her plans to release the album before the summer of 2022. Additionally, she will be headlining for the Wireless Festival in London, set to take place in July 2022.

Artistry

Musical style

Minaj is known for her animated rapping style and ""unique"" flow. Her rapping is distinctive for its speed and the use of alter egos and accents, primarily British cockney. She often both sings and raps in her songs, and has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, ""[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.""

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj ""a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones."" Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: ""What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention."" Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in list of ""most unique flows from rappers over the last five years"", saying that she ""has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.""

Noted as a rap artist, she also occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop). Pink Friday marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden ""Super Bass"". Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album, Pink Friday Roman Reloaded, had a number of electro-hop and electro pop songs: ""HOV Lane"", ""Whip It"", ""Automatic"", ""Come on a Cone"", ""Young Forever"", ""Fire Burns"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""The Boys"" and ""Beez in the Trap""; while ""Starships"" is a eurodance song.

Her verse on Kanye West's ""Monster"" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song. West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:

It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of ""Monster"" because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on ""Dark Fantasy"" and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… 

Tara Colley of The Conversation described Minaj as a ""pre-eminent female rapper"" and that she has ""consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either"" and that ""her chameleonic ability"" matches ""some of rap's most verbose, witty, filthy and pop-friendly"" stars such as Eminem and Lil Wayne. Zoe Johnson of XXL, stated that in recent years Minaj's ""beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare in recent years"".

Alter egos
With her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that ""fantasy was my reality"" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj. In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself ""healer to her fans"" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York. She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight.

One of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is ""a demon inside her"" named Roman Zolanski (named after film director Roman Polanski with modified surname), Minaj's ""twin brother"", whose character she assumes when she is angry. Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on ""Roman's Revenge"" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos. On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: ""And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot."" Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski, who appeared on ""Roman's Revenge"" with a British accent and singing on ""Roman Holiday"" for the first time. Martha appeared in the ""Moment 4 Life"" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.

Influences

Minaj cites Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z as major influences: ""I can't even imagine my career, um, my creative spirit without Wayne. [...] I feel like I'm still intertwined with him creatively."" Minaj has called Lil Wayne her mentor and credited him with discovering her. On Foxy Brown and Jay-Z, Minaj said: ""I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time."" She said, further: ""I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life"" adding that Foxy Brown was ""the most influential female rapper"" for her. Minaj said in a T Magazine interview in 2017: ""Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown... [...] Those are the three I keep in my head when I'm writing because they've influenced me so much, [...] I feel like I'm a part of all of them.""

Jada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career. Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing ""Why I Love You So Much"" at every talent show she entered. While performing in Atlanta as part of her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Lauryn Hill is also one of Minaj's major influences, with Minaj quoting her lyrics in a high school yearbook. Minaj has also cited Madonna, Enya, Eminem, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Trina, Drake, Remy Ma, and Lil' Kim as influences.

She called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: ""[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!"" Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: ""When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.""

Public image

Billboard listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart. Minaj is also the most followed rapper on Instagram with 155 million followers. On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with 22 million followers on the app, as of 2021. She joined American Idol as a judge in 2013. BET has named Minaj as a ""gay icon."" Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's RIAA certifications. The organization later announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams, as reported by Yahoo! News.

Minaj has been called as a ""fashion icon"" by Allure, Time, XXL and has been called a ""camp style icon"" by Refinery29. She has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers. The Huffington Post described her style as ""risk-taking"" and ""far-out"", with ""bold sartorial choices""; Minaj has been included on the annual Maxim Hot 100 list several times. In 2014, Minaj underwent a reinvention in her image sporting a ""natural"" and ""softer"" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes. She stated that she ""went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, ""Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more"""".

Her physique, notably her buttocks, has attracted significant attention from the media. Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women. In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the ""female rappers of [her] day"", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she ""[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.""

Minaj talked about feminism in an interview with Vogue in 2015, saying ""There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to."" In 2018, an interview with Elle, in which she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, attracted criticism. In The New York Times Magazine, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj ""has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind.""

The cover art and music video for her 2014 single, ""Anaconda"", attracted significant media attention upon release. The music video was viewed 19.6 million times in its first 24 hours of release. The Guardian called the video ""racy"" but noted that she ""doesn't shy from ruffling her audience's feathers"", while others praised Minaj for ""owning her sexuality"", examining her work through a feminist perspective. Another writer for The Guardian said, of the ""Anaconda"" video, Minaj turns ""the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance.""

Philanthropy

In 2010, Minaj performed a cover of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", alongside singer Katy Perry, for service members during the 2010 VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert. The two would later collaborate in 2017 on ""Swish Swish"". In 2011, Mattel created a Barbie doll with Minaj's likeness to auction for Project Angel Food, a charity that provides food for people afflicted with HIV and AIDS. In 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Minaj donated $15,000 to the Food Bank For New York City and held a turkey drive at her alma mater, PS 45.

In May 2017, Minaj offered via Twitter to pay college tuition fees and student loans for 30 of her fans. She appeared to grant their requests, ranging from $500 to school supplies to $6,000 for tuition, promising to respond to more requests in a month or two. She also announced that she would launch an official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future. In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to a village in India for a few years via her pastor, Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program, and two water wells. ""This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud"", she said about the new additions to the village.

In August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was ""praying for everyone there"". On September 4, 2018, Minaj appeared as a guest and performed several songs on The Ellen Degeneres Show. Throughout the episode, Minaj and Degeneres, with the participation of Walmart, gave out over $150,000 in donations to fans. In 2019, Minaj pulled out of headlining a concert in Saudi Arabia following online backlash from activists, after women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul, was detained and arrested for speaking out against the Saudi regime. Minaj was praised by Thor Halvorssen of The Human Rights Foundation, who criticized her initial plan to perform in a letter, and released a statement saying, ""After careful reflection [...] I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.""

In 2020, Minaj donated $25,000 to the ""St. Jude's Home for Girls"" school after visiting the school in her native country of Trinidad. In a speech, Minaj encouraged the girls to push through hard obstacles, even referencing her own experience with domestic violence: ""I've experienced being in a home with domestic violence. I've experienced, you know, being at a very difficult crossroads in my life as a teenager. And sometimes as a teenager when things happen, you feel like there's no up from there."" In the same year, following the release of Minaj and 6ix9ine's collaboration, ""Trollz"", Minaj announced that a portion of the proceeds from the song, along with profits from all merchandise, will go towards the Bail Project amid the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.

Legacy
Various media outlets, such as Billboard, Time, NME, NBC News, Cosmopolitan and GQ have referred to Minaj as the ""Queen of Rap"" and The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, and LA Times have referred to her as the ""Queen of Hip Hop"".

In 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj ""the most influential female rapper of all time"", and in 2015 Vanessa Grigoriadis from its magazine called her ""the world's biggest female rap superstar"". In Evening Standard, Jochan Embley called her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, saying that ""Everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics, which stare gender and race dead in the eye."" Zoe Johnson from XXL called her ""one of the most versatile MCs"" and that she has ""made millions off upbeat pop hits and traditional hip-hop sounds that cater to both her femininity and her assertive side"".

For NPR Music, Sowmya Krishnamurthy noted that Minaj has portrayed ""the quirky, life-size Barbie, glamorous vixen and girl-next-door"", arguing that she ""changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade"" with said alter egos. In 2017, Patrik Sandberg of Dazed argued that Minaj has ""surpassed every other female hip hop artist to become the most successful in history"" in 2017. In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the ""best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years — no gender preposition required."" Glamour included Minaj in their list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture.

In XXL, Madeline Roth commented that Minaj ""has helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style"".

With over 140 features, the magazine has called Minaj a ""rap and pop icon"" adding that ""she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles."" Minaj has been credited by Complex for being able to ""take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it."" In 2012, Caramanica in The New York Times said that:Minaj ""became a nimble, evocative rapper. She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations [...] with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark.""

In 2014, NPRs Erik Nielson said that Minaj's ""success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists"". Nylon writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which ""stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium"", also going on to say that Minaj ""battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound"" thus impacting her career. Complex also commented that, ""From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely... [she] doesn't need anything but her art to speak for itself"". Complex named her ""Best Rapper Alive"" in 2014, making her the only female being named so.

Her first collaboration was a November 2010 endorsement deal with MAC Cosmetics which sold a lipstick, ""Pink 4 Friday"", for four consecutive Fridays to promote her album Pink Friday. In 2011, Minaj helped introduce the Casio TRYX in Times Square, and created a six-piece nail polish collection for OPI Products with colors named after her songs.

Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone stated that the ""Minaj Barbie doll is notable in that the rapper has made Barbie dolls a crucial part of her aesthetic.""

In early 2013, Minaj fronted the Viva Glam campaign by herself, which included the introduction of ""Nicki 2 lipstick and lip gloss"".

COVID-19 vaccine controversy
In September 2021, Minaj announced she would not be attending the 2021 Met Gala due to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. She stated that she has avoided public appearances and traveling after contracting the virus herself and having to quarantine from her son as a result. Minaj shared several tweets about her unvaccinated status and claimed she wanted to do more research and be comfortable with her decision first. She alleged in a Tweet that her cousin's friend in Trinidad suffered swollen testicles and became impotent as a result of the vaccine. These tweets received backlash where her story about her cousin's friend became the subject of jokes and memes. Trinidad and Tobago health minister Terrence Deyalsingh declared that Minaj's claims were false and that no such report existed.

Shortly after, Minaj recommended other people get the vaccine and set up a Twitter poll on COVID-19 vaccine brands. She tweeted that she was sure she would get vaccinated herself because of touring. The White House offered Minaj a phone call with a doctor to answer questions about the safety of the vaccine. In an Instagram Live response two days later, she claimed that she was ""simply asking questions"" and she did not ""give any facts"" about the vaccine. Reporters allegedly harassed Minaj's family for a story, with Minaj sharing some text messages she alleged were harassment on social media.

Personal life
In her song ""All Things Go"", Minaj revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager. She has said that although it has ""haunted"" her, she stands by her decision. In July 2011, her cousin Nicholas Telemaque was murdered near his home in Brooklyn, an incident she references in her songs ""All Things Go"" and ""Champion"". In February 2021, Minaj's father, Robert Maraj, died while walking along a road on Long Island in a hit-and-run accident. Charles Polevich, a 70-year-old man, was charged with killing Maraj. He was arraigned and charged with two felonies: leaving scene of incident involving death of a person and tampering with or suppressing physical evidence. Minaj commented on her father's death in a letter, saying, ""[..] it has been the most devastating loss of my life. I find myself wanting to call him all the time, more so now that he's gone. [...] May his soul rest in paradise. He was very loved & will be very missed.""

Early in her career, Minaj identified as bisexual and made several references to it in her music. However, she eventually stated in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview, ""I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls."" She once again addressed her sexuality in 2020 on Doja Cat's ""Say So"" remix, ""Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero."" The lyric received backlash and divided members of the LGBT community, with some accusing her of ""bisexual erasure"" while others voicing ""there is nothing wrong with originally identifying as bisexual, and then later identifying as straight.""

In late 2014, Minaj separated from her longtime boyfriend Safaree Samuels, whom she had dated since 2003. According to Minaj, he had proposed to her, but she declined. Several tracks on The Pinkprint are believed to have been inspired by the end of their relationship. Minaj began dating rapper Meek Mill in early 2015. In January 2017, she announced that she had ended their relationship. She briefly dated fellow rapper Nas in the year 2017.

In December 2018, Minaj began dating her childhood friend Kenneth ""Zoo"" Petty and filed for a marriage license in August 2019. She announced that they had officially married on October 21. She hyphenated his last name to hers upon marriage. In July 2020, Minaj announced via Instagram that she was expecting her first child with Petty. On September 30, 2020, she gave birth to a son. Minaj refers to him as ""Papa Bear"" in public.

Legal issues 
After facing charges for failing to register as a sex offender in California, her husband Kenneth Petty was entered into the California Megan's Law database in 2020, having been convicted of attempted rape in 1995 in New York. He previously served nearly four years in prison for the mentioned crime. In August 2021, her husband's victim, named Jennifer Hough, filed a lawsuit against the couple for alleged harassment and intimidation, and alleged infliction of emotional distress, and did an interview about the mentioned lawsuit on the talk show The Real.

While Minaj has not publicly commented on the case, she addressed the accusations in a December case filing. Minaj claimed: ""I never asked [Hough] to change her story; I never offered her any money in return for a statement, and I did not threaten her with any type of harm if she chose not to provide a statement. [...] I emphatically told her that I did not want her to lie about anything and to tell the truth about what she had just revealed to me only if she was comfortable with doing so."" Hough later voluntarily dropped the case against Minaj. Speaking to a federal judge, Hough's lawyers expressed that they were going to refile the lawsuit in California, while Maraj's lawyer said that the refiling was a ""friviolous gambit to avoid a sanctions motion which I told them I would be filing shortly.""

The awards have been sponsored and co-hosted by blogs such as GigaOm, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, and ReadWriteWeb (which no longer participates), and tabulated from votes on their sites. Awards have been given out at ceremonies at various theaters in San Francisco, California.

The award, a plastic sculpture of a primate standing on top of a computer with a bone in his hand, is a reference to the opening scenes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or possibly to a scene spoofing that movie in Zoolander.

November 9, 2017 Techcrunch announced that the award show would be ending as part of the streamlining of operations by parent owner Verizon Communications.

History
The Southwark Rail-Road was chartered on April 2, 1831. The company constructed tracks in 1835, along Broad Street from South Street to Washington Avenue, and along Washington Avenue {Prime} from Broad Street to the Delaware River. At the intersection of Broad Street and Washington Avenue, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad ended at the Southwark Rail-Road. The PW&B's passenger station was just west of Broad Street; the Southwark Rail-Road was intended for freight, and was leased to and operated by the PW&B. At the South Street end, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad continued north on Broad Street.

The tracks on Broad Street were removed in 1870. Around the same time, tracks were built along the riverfront from the yard at the river north to Almond Street (now Kenilworth Street), connecting it to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Delaware Extension.

On March 28, 1877, the Southwark Rail-Road was merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, along with several other railroads. In 1881, the Pennsylvania Railroad bought up the majority of the PW&B's stock. The company was later merged into the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, another PRR subsidiary.

He also played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the New England Whalers. After retiring in 1976 he became a coach with the Whalers, and remained in that position through 1981, serving as their first coach when they joined the NHL in 1979 as the Hartford Whalers.

Playing career
Except for a six-game stint with the Boston Bruins, Blackburn spent the majority of the early portion of his career with various minor league teams. He was a dominant force with the Quebec Aces of the AHL during the mid-1960s, including a 36-goal performance in 1965–66. He was selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the NHL expansion draft and was a regular contributor during the first two years of the fledgling team's existence. In 1969, he was traded to the New York Rangers, but he played sparingly in two years with the team. He was claimed by the New York Islanders in the 1972 expansion draft, but was traded to the Minnesota North Stars late in the season. He finished his career with three seasons with the WHA's Whalers, scoring 59 points in 1973–74.

Coaching career
Blackburn was the first ever Hartford Whalers coach. He led them to a 27–34–19 record in the 1979–80 NHL season. In the playoffs, the Whalers were swept by Montreal in three games. Blackburn was fired midway through the 1980–81 season after the Whalers sat with a record of 15–29–16. He was replaced by interim coach Larry Pleau.

The company was founded in 2004 by Magatte Wade-Marchand, Greg Steltenpohl (one of the co-founders of Odwalla Inc.) and Dominique Leveuf. Adina is led by ""an international team of entrepreneurs from Odwalla, SoBe and Peet's Coffee"" and has worked to preserve traditional beverage recipes from around the world from ""being replaced by cola drinks distributed by multinational corporations"".

Adina manufactures the drinks from ""sustainable"" ingredients obtained through fair trade and sourced from small-scale farmers in places like India, Guatemala, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. The company says it works to aid to impoverished farmers.

Origin

Magatte Wade-Marchand came up with the idea to found a beverage company when she visited her native Senegal and found that cola had replaced traditional hibiscus drinks. Worried that the drinks and the heritage would be lost, Wade-Marchand approached Greg Steltenpohl, who had recently left as head of Odwalla Inc., and asked for help to begin a company. He agreed, and, with his wife, Dominique Leveuf, the three began the company. Adina for Life is headquartered at 660 York Street in San Francisco, California. To fund the start-up, the founders contributed heavily; in addition, the trio raised $5 million in investments in early years.

The company sells a variety of beverages based on drinks from around the world in 14 fluid ounce bottles, mainly to the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the company is promoting their products in large cities throughout the United States like New York City and Austin, Texas.

Partnerships
Adina is partnered with several organizations that share their goals, including Agribusiness in Sustainable Natural African Plant Products (ASNAPP), which works to reduce poverty in Africa; Association Education Santé (AES), which works to help hibiscus farmers in the global market; the ECO-AGRI Research Foundation, a non-profit organization centered in India seeking to improve the lives of rural farmers; as well as other co-ops and financers in third-world countries.

Products
Adina's natural beverages span four product lines:
 Adina Organic Blends, an organic Fair Trade line of exotic gourmet coffees and tea launched in late 2007
 Adina Miracle Fruits Fortified Juice Drinks launched in 2006
 Adina Organic Juice Coolers launched in 2005. For
Adina launched its Natural Highs fair trade certified all natural cold-brewed coffee energy drink in October 2008. The drinks are sold at Whole Foods Market and come in various flavors such as mocha, hazelnut and double espresso.

1992 birthsSamukh District () is one of the 66 districts of Azerbaijan. It is located in the north-west of the country and belongs to the Ganja-Qazakh Economic Region. The district borders the districts of Goranboy, Goygol, Shamkir, Tovuz, Qakh, Yevlakh, city of Ganja and the Kakheti region of Georgia. Its capital and largest city is Samukh. As of 2020, the district had a population of 58,800.

History 
The name ""Samukh"" comes from a Caucasian Albanian word for 'Forest Hunting Place'. A related term, Samonis, is used to mark this area on Ptolemy's 2nd-century BC map of the Caucasus. 
There are Bronze Age burial mounds around Samux Town.

As an administrative unit, an entity known as Samukh Rayon was formed in 1930, centred on Garachayly settlement. However, in 1954, the construction of Mingechevir Hydro Power Plant rendered the region impractical as an administrative unit and Samukh Rayon was abolished, its territory thereafter falling within an expanded Safaraliyev Rayon. Safaraliyev Rayon had itself been detached from the Ganjabasar on January 24, 1940 by Decree No.11 of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1959, Safaraliyev Rayon was itself abolished. However, after Azerbaijan's independence, the entity was recreated albeit under the name Samukh Rayon according to Decree No.72 of National Soviet of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan on February 18, 1992. Its administrative center, Safaraliyev settlement, was renamed Nəbiağalı on December 31, 1992, then renamed again as Samux during 2008.

Population 

By the beginning of 2017, the population of the region was 57.1 thousand, of which 21.4 thousand were urban population and 35.5 thousand were rural population.

Geography
There are such rare trees as Eldar pear and Gum-tree, which grow right on rocks, not saline lands. The tree grows only on an area of 392 hectares in Samukh. The Eldar pine-tree emits a lot of oxygen, therefore, it is good for those suffering from asthma.

2,479,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type1,"A thermal optimum is either a portion of a specified geological time span in which the average temperature was above that of the average temperature for the entire specified time or the optimum range within which a biological process may take place or the ambient optimal range for a species' niche.

In geology, scientists speak of a Holocene thermal optimum or maximum, for example, when referring to the warm period from 7000 to 2500 BC, in which an overall rise in average temperature is seen in evidence from ice cores and from stable isotope data.  Scientists are interested in these periods because they may be clues to evolutionary pressures experienced by species during large spans of time.

In biology a thermal optimum describes the ideal boundaries for biological processes such as growth and development, and is usually characteristic of a species or population.  Most biological processes are dependent upon enzymatic activity that can be impacted by the organism's body temperature, which in term is a function of the organism's metabolism and environment as each enzyme has a finite window in which it can function properly.  An organism's niche in the environment may then be dependent upon the thermal optima for all of its necessary biological processes.

In animals that inhabit the wave-tossed tidal pools of rocky shores thermal optima vary for each species and dictate the species' tolerance of environmental conditions that lead to increased heating or loss of mechanisms for cooling.  For example, exposure to sunlight when the tide is out, and lack of thermal insulation from the buffering effects of water due to its specific heat capacity may contribute to increased temperature leading to increased desiccation.  An organism that has a high thermal optimum may still be able to function in this environment, while one with a lower thermal optimum may have its metabolic processes shut down during the drying period of exposure.  An organism may be confined to a limited range of habitats due to the population's thermal optima, while another population may have a different range of habitats open to it due to a different thermal optima for its biological processes.  Ultimately the ability to adapt to greater extremes in such a harsh environment as the rocky shores where tide pools are formed may then be discussed in terms of varying environmental thermal optima for different species.

Living peopleRanatra is a genus of slender predatory insects of the family Nepidae, known as water scorpions or water stick-insects. There are around 100 Ranatra species found in freshwater habitats around the world, both in warm and temperate regions, with the highest diversity in South America (almost 50 species) and Asia (about 30 species, reviewed in 1972). Fewer are found elsewhere, but include several African, some in North America, three from Australia and three from the Palearctic, notably the relatively well-known European R. linearis.

These brown insects are primarily found in stagnant or slow-moving water like ponds, marshes and canals, but can also be seen in streams. Exceptionally they have been recorded from hypersaline lakes and brackish lagoons.

Biology
Their front legs are strong and used to grasp prey. They typically eat other insects, tadpoles and small fish, which they pierce with their proboscis and inject a saliva which both sedates and begins to digest their prey. They are sit-and-wait predators that reside among water plants and position themselves head-down with their grasping legs extended out to surprise passing prey. At least one species will also swim in open water at night to catch zooplanktonic organisms. Like other members in the family they have a long tail-like siphon, or breathing tube, on the rear end of their body. The adult body length is generally  depending on the exact species, and females average larger than males of the same species. The siphon is typically almost the same size, but varies from less than half the body length to somewhat longer. Two of the largest species are the East Asian R. chinensis and South American R. magna. Ranatra do have wings and they can fly.

The adults are active year-round, except in extreme cold. Their eggs are positioned on plants just below the water surface, but in some species they can be placed in mud. The eggs typically take two to four weeks to hatch and the young take about two months to mature.

Among the four genera in the Ranatrinae subfamily, Austronepa and Goondnomdanepa are restricted to Australia. Cercotmetus from Asia to New Guinea resembles Ranatra, although the former has a distinctly shorter siphon.

52,482,2053-4-4 00:00:00,note_type3,"Barbera del Sannio is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Campania region of southern Italy. Despite the similarities in name and appearance, the grape has no close genetic relationship with the Piedmont wine grapes Barbera or Barbera bianca or the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda and is, instead, more closely related to the Campanian varieties Casavecchia and Catalanesca and the Apulian grape Nero di Troia.

In Campania, Barbera del Sannio is often used as a blending variety that adds color and aroma notes to the wine but it is also permitted to be made as a varietal wine in Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Sannio.

History and relationship to other grapes

Ampelographers believe that the first documented account of Barbera del Sannio was in 1844 by Italian botanist Guglielmo Gasparrini in his account of native plant life in southern Italy. Gasparrini used the old synonyms Lugliese and Lugliatica to describe the grape with Luglio being the Italian word for the month of July, a potential reference to the color change of veraison during the growing season when the hard white berries of the vine start to turn dark red. By 1875, the grape was known as Barbera, being described by ampelographer Giuseppe Froio as similar in appearance to the Piedmont variety.

For most of the 20th century, Barbera del Sannio was thought to be a local clone of the Piedmontese Barbera which created confusion in the DOC wine laws and regulations for regions where the two grapes were grown. It wasn't until the early 21st century when DNA analysis showed that the two grape varieties were distinct and that Barbera del Sannio shared no close genetic relationship with any Piedmontese variety (even the similarly named Barbera bianca). Instead, Barbera del Sannio appears to be closely related to several southern Italian varieties such as Nero di Troia (also known as Uva di Troia and Summariello) grape of Apulia and the Campanian varieties of Casavecchia and Catalanesca. However, since Barbera del Sannio (or its close relations) do not appear to be closely related to older Campanian varieties, such as Aglianico, Piedirosso, Falanghina, Fiano, Greco and Coda di Volpe, ampelographers believe that the vine was a relatively recent introduction to Campania.

Viticulture
Barbera del Sannio is a very vigorous vine that can be prone to producing a large, leafy canopy if not kept in check by pruning and canopy management techniques. The vine produces berries with very thick skins, rich in phenolics and color compounds, that also gives the vine some resistance to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot.

Wine regions

Most plantings of Barbera del Sannio can be found in province of Benevento in Campania, particularly around the village of Castelvenere. The grape can be used as a minor blending component for several Campanian DOC wines but can also be produced as a varietal in the Sannio DOC which covers the Sannio Hills that run through the heart of Campanian in the Benevento province.

Barbera del Sannio grapes destined for DOC red or rosé production in Sannio must be harvested to a yield no greater than 12 tonnes/hectare. The generic DOC red and rosé wines (non varietal) are made from a blend of at least 50% Sangiovese with Barbera del Sannio and other local red grape varieties, such as Piedirosso and Sciascinoso, permitted to fill in the remainder. For both varietal and blended wines, the finished alcohol level must be at least 11%.

Styles
According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Barbera del Sannio tends to produce medium-bodied wines that are deeply colored and highly aromatic. It is most often used a blending component but some producers in the Sannio DOC have been producing varietal style wines from the grape.

Synonyms
Over the years, Barbera del Sannio has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Barbetta, Lugliese and Lugliatica. However, the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) currently doesn't recognize any synonyms for Barbera del Sannio.

Red wine grape varietiesThe bomb pulse is the sudden increase of carbon-14 (14C) in the Earth's atmosphere due to the hundreds of aboveground nuclear bombs tests that started in 1945 and intensified after 1950 until 1963, when the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. These hundreds of blasts were followed by a doubling of the relative concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. We discuss “relative concentration”, because measurements of 14C levels by mass spectrometers are most accurately made by comparison to another carbon isotope, often the common isotope 12C.  Isotope abundance ratios are not only more easily measured, they are what 14C carbon daters want, since it is the fraction of carbon in a sample that is 14C, not the absolute concentration, that is of interest in dating measurements.  The figure shows how the fraction of carbon in the atmosphere that is 14C, of order only a part per trillion, has changed over the past several decades following the bomb tests.  Because 12C concentration has increased by about 30% over the past fifty years, the fact that “pMC”, measuring the isotope ratio, has returned (almost) to its 1955 value, means that 14C concentration in the atmosphere remains some 30% higher than it once was. Carbon-14, the radioisotope of carbon, is naturally developed in trace amounts in the atmosphere and it can be detected in all living organisms. Carbon of all types is continually used to form the molecules of the cells of organisms. Doubling of the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere is reflected in the tissues and cells of all organisms that lived around the period of nuclear testing. This property has many applications in the fields of biology and forensics.

Background 
The radioisotope carbon-14 is constantly formed from nitrogen-14 (14N) in the higher atmosphere by incoming cosmic rays which generate neutrons. These neutrons collide with 14N to produce 14C which then combines with oxygen to form 14CO2. This radioactive CO2 spreads through the lower atmosphere and the oceans where it is absorbed by the plants and the animals that eat the plants. The radioisotope 14C thus becomes part of the biosphere so that all living organisms contain a certain amount of 14C. Nuclear testing caused a rapid increase in atmospheric 14C (see figure), since the explosion of an atomic bomb also creates neutrons which collide again with 14N and produce 14C. Since the ban on nuclear testing in 1963, atmospheric 14C relative concentration is slowly decreasing at a pace of 4% annually. This continuous decrease permits scientists to determine among others the age of deceased people and allows them to study cell activity in tissues. By measuring the amount of 14C in a population of cells and comparing that to the amount of 14C in the atmosphere during or after the bomb pulse, scientists can estimate when the cells were created and how often they've turned over since then.

Difference with classical radiocarbon dating 
Radiocarbon dating has been used since 1946 to determine the age of organic material as old as 50,000 years. As the organism dies, the exchange of 14C with the environment ceases and the incorporated 14C decays. Given the steady decay of radioisotopes (the half-life of 14C is about 5,730 years), the relative amount of 14C left in the dead organism can be used to calculate how long ago it died. Bomb pulse dating should be considered a special form of carbon dating. As discussed above and in the Radiolab episode, Elements (section 'Carbon'),  in bomb pulse dating the slow absorption of atmospheric 14C by the biosphere, can be considered as a chronometer. Starting from the pulse around the years 1963 (see figure), atmospheric radiocarbon relative abundance decreased by about 4% a year. So in bomb pulse dating it is the relative amount of 14C in the atmosphere that is decreasing and not the amount of 14C in a dead organisms, as is the case in classical radiocarbon dating. This decrease in atmospheric 14C can be measured in cells and tissues and has permitted scientists to determine the age of individual cells and of deceased people. These applications are very similar to the experiments conducted with pulse-chase analysis in which cellular processes are examined over time by exposing the cells to a labeled compound (pulse) and then to the same compound in an unlabeled form (chase). Radioactivity is a commonly used label in these experiments. An important difference between pulse-chase analysis and bomb-pulse dating is the absence of the chase in the latter.

Around the year 2030 the bomb pulse will die out. Every organism born after this will not bear detectable bomb pulse traces and their cells cannot be dated in this way. Radioactive pulses cannot ethically be administered to people just to study the turnover of their cells so the bomb pulse results may be considered as a useful side effect of nuclear testing.

Applications 
The fact that cells and tissues reflect the doubling of 14C in the atmosphere during and after nuclear testing, has been of great use for several biological studies, for forensics and even for the determination of the year in which certain wine was produced.

Biology 
Biological studies carried out by Kirsty Spalding demonstrated that neuronal cells are essentially static and do not regenerate during life. She also showed that the number of fat cells is set during childhood and adolescence. Considering the amount of 14C present in DNA she could establish that 10% of fat cells are renewed annually. The radiocarbon bomb pulse has been used to validate otolith annuli (ages scored from otolith sections) across several fish species including the freshwater drum, lake sturgeon, pallid sturgeon, bigmouth buffalo, arctic salmonids, Pristipomoides filamentosus, several reef fishes, among numerous other validated freshwater and marine species. The precision for bomb radiocarbon age validation is typically within +/- 2 years because the rise period (1956-1960) is so steep. The bomb pulse has also been used to estimate (not validate) the age of Greenland sharks by measuring the incorporation of 14C in the eye lens during development. After having determined the age and measured the length of sharks born around the bomb pulse, it was possible to create a mathematical model in which length and age of the sharks were correlated in order to deduce the age of the larger sharks. The study showed that the Greenland shark, with an age of 392 +/- 120 years, is the oldest known vertebrate.

Forensics 
At the moment of death, carbon uptake is ended. Considering that tissue that contained the bomb pulse 14C was rapidly diminishing with a rate of 4% per year, it has been possible to establish the time of death of two women in a court case by examining tissues with a rapid turnover.  Another important application has been the identification of victims of the Southeast Asian tsunami 2004 by examining their teeth.

Carbon Transport Modeling 
The perturbation in atmospheric 14C from the bomb testing was an opportunity to validate atmospheric transport models, and to study the movement of carbon between the atmosphere and oceanic or terrestrial sinks.

Other 
Atmospheric bomb 14C has been used to validate tree ring ages and to date recent trees that have no annual growth rings.

78,483,2052-3-3 00:00:00,note_type2,"Wellow is a village in Nottinghamshire, England. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 444, increasing to 470 at the 2011 census.

It has a village green and a maypole, which is still in use. The parish church of St Swithin is 12th century, which was restored, with a new chancel, in 1878–9. On the east and south sides of the village are the remains of a defensive ditch, which originally encircled the village. To the south is the deserted medieval village of Grimston, which now forms part of the Manor of Wellow. To the north east is Jordan Castle, a Norman ringwork consisting of a circular earthwork surrounded by a bank and ditch.

Wellow also has, in Wellow Park, the largest remaining example of ash-wych elm woodland in Nottinghamshire.

History of The Lordship of the Manor of Wellow

The manors of Wellow and Grimston have anciently been held by the lords of Jordon Castle, and the lords of the manor of Wellow

In 1290 Richard Foliot, Knight of Jordon Castle had the rights of Stallage of the market and fair on St. Swithuns day valued at 40s yearly in Wellow.

Jordan Foliot, Baron de Foliot, Lord of Jordon Castle was granted the power to embattle his dwelling at Jordon Castle, he was the Lord of the Manor of Grimston, and Wellow, and of Besthorpe, with the Soc of Grimston, and its members, in Kirton Schidrintune, in Willoughby, and Walesby, in Besthorpe, and Carleton, and in Franesfeild.

Cratley and Walesby have been held as Sub Manor of Wellow and Grimston.

There was an assize in the time of King John, between the Abbot of Rufford, and William, son of Robert, and others, concerning Common of Pasture in Wellow and Grimston, The Abbot pleaded that they could not claim nor have any common of pasture in the pasture of the said Abbot, nor he in theirs, because the said lands and pastures were granted from lands of divers Baronies (or lordships) viz. of the Barony of Robert de Cauz, and the Barony of Gilbert de Gant, and that bounds were made between them, that neither Barony could have Common of Pasture in the other, and produced the letters of King John, which testified to these facts.

Wellow is reputed to have the second largest acreage of registered common land north of Watford, over parts of which the Wellow toftholders still have grazing rights.

The village is associated with Robin Hood.  An historian has claimed Robin Hood was a pseudonym by which the ancient Lords of Wellow were once known.

Construction of the Cathedral began on Christmas Day, 1842 with the laying of the cornerstone by King Otto and Queen Amalia. Construction started under the architect Theophil Hansen and was continued by Dimitris Zezos, Panagis Kalkos and François Boulanger.

Workers used marble from 72 demolished churches to build the Cathedral's immense walls. Three architects and 20 years later, it was completed. On May 21, 1862, the completed Cathedral was dedicated to the Annunciation of the Mother of God (Ευαγγελισμός της Θεοτόκου) by the King and Queen.  The Cathedral is a three-aisled, domed basilica that measures  long,  wide, and  high.  Inside are the tombs of two saints killed by the Ottoman Turks during the Ottoman period: Saint Philothei and Patriarch Gregory V.

 Saint Philothei built a convent, was martyred in 1589, and her bones are still visible in a silver reliquary. She is honored for ransoming Greek women enslaved in Ottoman Empire's harems.
 Gregory V the Ethnomartyr, Patriarch of Constantinople, was hanged by order of Sultan Mahmud II and his body thrown into the Bosphorus in 1821, in retaliation for the Greek uprising on March 25, leading to the Greek War of Independence. His body was rescued by Greek sailors and eventually enshrined in Athens.

To the immediate south of the Cathedral is the little Church of St. Eleftherios also called the ""Little Mitropoli.""

In the Square in front of the Cathedral stand two statues. The first is that of Constantine XI, the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire. The second is a statue of Archbishop Damaskinos who was Archbishop of Athens during World War II and was Regent for King George II and Prime Minister of Greece in 1946.

The Metropolitan Cathedral remains a major landmark in Athens and the site of important ceremonies with national political figures present, as well as weddings and funerals of notable personalities.

Origin 
In 2000, after finishing touring for Soundsystem, the five members of 311 grew distraught with having to pay upwards of $2,000 a day in professional recording studios. Seeking a more independent-style place to work, they found a place in North Hollywood where they could record and pay rent of $3,000 a month. The band soon loaded in two 24 track analog tape machines and Pro Tools technology, fully furnished the place, and began working on their next album.

Recordings done at the Hive 
Prior to 311 purchasing The Hive, it was actively used as a music studio in the 1970s and 1980s. Notable acts such as Missing Persons and Adam Ant have recorded there. Just before 311 started using it, it was used as a voice-over studio for movies.

Since 311 moved into the studio, they have recorded and mixed six albums at The Hive; 2001's From Chaos, 2003's Evolver, 2005's Don't Tread on Me, 2009's Uplifter, 2011's Universal Pulse and 2014's Stereolithic. The band worked with producer Ron Saint Germain on From Chaos, Evolver, and Don't Tread on Me, while Bob Rock produced Uplifter and Universal Pulse, and Scott Ralston produced Stereolithic, making it the first time since 1999's Soundsystem that he produced a 311 album.

Other, lesser-known recording artists have also recorded sessions at The Hive, the most notable being the Volcom Entertainment act Pepper who recorded the minor-hit ""Give It Up"" at The Hive.

The Hive can be seen in more detail on the Enhanced CD features on From Chaos and Evolver.

The peninsula extends  from Mexicali, Baja California in the north to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur in the south. It ranges from  at its narrowest to  at its widest point and has approximately  of coastline and approximately 65 islands. The total area of the Baja California Peninsula is , roughly the same area as the country of Nepal.

The peninsula is separated from mainland Mexico by the Gulf of California and the Colorado River. There are four main desert areas on the peninsula: the San Felipe Desert, the Central Coast Desert, the Vizcaíno Desert and the Magdalena Plain Desert.

History

The land of California existed as a myth among European explorers before it was discovered. The earliest known mention of the idea of California was in the 1510 romance novel Las Sergas de Esplandián by Spanish author Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo. The book described the Island of California as being west of the Indies, ""very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons"".

Following Hernán Cortés's conquest of Mexico, the lure of an earthly paradise as well as the search for the fabled Strait of Anián, helped motivate him to send several expeditions to the west coast of New Spain in the 1530s and early 1540s. In 1539, explorer Francisco de Ulloa proved that Baja California was a peninsula rather than an island. Nevertheless, the idea of the island persisted for well over a century and was included in many maps. The water separating the island, now called ""Gulf of California"" was sometimes called the ""Red Sea"". The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula and lands to the north, including both Baja California and Alta California, the region that became parts of the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.

Timeline
1532: Hernán Cortés sends three ships north along the coast of Mexico in search of the Island of California. The three ships disappear without a trace.
1533: Cortés sends a follow-up mission to search for the lost ships. Pilot Fortún Ximénez leads a mutiny and founds a settlement in the Bay of La Paz before being killed.
1539: Francisco de Ulloa explores both coasts.
1622: A map by Michiel Colijn of Amsterdam showed California as a peninsula rather than an island. Previous maps show the Gulf terminating in its correct location.
1690s–1800s: Spanish settlement and colonization in lower Las Californias (Baja California peninsula), the first Spanish missions in Baja California are established by Jesuit missionaries.
1701: Explorations by Eusebio Kino expanded knowledge of the Gulf of California coast. Kino did not believe California was an island.
1767: Jesuits expelled; Franciscans take over the Baja missions.
1769: Franciscans go with the Portola expedition to establish new missions in Alta California. Control of the existing Baja missions passes to the Dominican Order.
1773: Francisco Palóu's line demarcates Franciscan and Dominican areas of mission control.
1804: Las Californias divided into Alta (""Upper"") and Baja (""Lower"") California, using Palóu's line.
1810–1821: Mexican War of Independence
1821: First Mexican Empire, Baja California Territory established, covering Baja California Peninsula.
1847: The Battle of La Paz and the Siege of La Paz occurs, as well as several other engagements.
1848: Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo cedes Alta California to the United States. As a U.S. territory it receives the California Gold Rush, causing increased maritime traffic along the peninsula.
1850: California admitted to U.S. statehood.
1853: William Walker, with 45 men, captures the capital city of La Paz and declares himself President of the Republic of Lower California. Mexico forces him to retreat a few months later.
1930–31: The Territory of Baja California is further divided into Northern and Southern territories (North Territory of Baja California and South Territory of Baja California).
1952: The North Territory of Baja California becomes the 29th State of Mexico, Baja California. The southern portion, below 28°N, remains a federally administered territory.
1973: The  long Trans-Peninsular Highway (Mexican Federal Highway 1), is finished. It is the first paved road that spans the entire peninsula. The highway was built by the Mexican government to improve Baja California's economy and increase tourism.
1974: The South Territory of Baja California becomes the 31st state, Baja California Sur.

Political divisions

The province of the Californias was united until 1804, in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain, when it was divided into Alta (upper) and Baja (lower) California.

The two Californias division was kept after Mexican independence in 1821. The Spanish Baja California Province became Mexican Baja California Territory, and remained a separate territory until 1836. In 1836, the Siete Leyes constitutional reforms reunited both Californias in the Departamento de las Californias. After 1848, the Baja California Peninsula again became a Mexican territory when Alta California was ceded to the United States (see 1854 map).

In 1931 Baja California Territory was divided into northern and southern territories. In 1952, the ""North Territory of Baja California"" became the 29th State of Mexico as Baja California. In 1974, the ""South Territory of Baja California"" became the 31st state as Baja California Sur.

Baja California

The northern part is the state of Baja California. It is sometimes informally referred to as Baja California Norte, to distinguish it from both the Baja California Peninsula and the adjacent state Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California are named bajacalifornianos (""Lower Californians"" in English). Mexicali is the capital.

Baja California Sur

The southern part, below 28° north, is the state of Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California Sur are named sudcalifornianos (""South Californians"" in English). La Paz is its capital.

Geology

The Baja California Peninsula was once a part of the North American Plate, the tectonic plate of which mainland Mexico remains a part.  About 12 to 15 million years ago the East Pacific Rise began cutting into the margin of the North American Plate, initiating the separation of the peninsula from it.  Spreading within the Gulf of California consists of short oblique rifts or ridge segments connected by long northwest trending transform faults, which together comprise the Gulf of California Rift Zone.  The north end of the rift zone is located in the Brawley seismic zone in the Salton Sea basin between the Imperial Fault and the San Andreas Fault.  The Baja California Peninsula is now part of the Pacific Plate and is moving with it away from the East Pacific Rise in a north northwestward direction.

Along the coast north of Santa Rosalia, Baja California Sur is a prominent volcanic activity area.

Volcanoes of the peninsula and adjacent islands include:
Volcanoes of east-central Baja California
Cerro Prieto
The San Quintín Volcanic Field
Isla San Luis
Jaraguay volcanic field
Coronado
Guadalupe
San Borja volcanic field
El Aguajito
Tres Vírgenes
Isla Tortuga
Comondú-La Purísima

Researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography have found a 2,000-year-old layer of non-decomposed roots, or peat, up to  under the desert mangroves. The peat layer acts like a sponge for stored atmospheric carbon, a record of sea-level-rise is also recorded in the peat layer.

The desert mangroves restricted to rocky inlets on the rugged coast of Baja California have been growing over their own root remains over thousands of years to compensate for sea-level rise, accumulating a thick layer of peat below their roots. However, mangroves in flat coastal floodplains have accumulated a thinner peat layer.

Geography

The Peninsular Ranges form the backbone of the peninsula.  They are an uplifted and eroded Jurassic to Cretaceous batholith, part of the same original batholith chain which formed much of the Sierra Nevada mountains in U.S. California. This chain was formed primarily as a result of the subduction of the Farallon Plate millions of years ago all along the margin of North America.
   
The Sierra de Juárez is the northernmost range in Mexico.
The Sierra San Pedro Mártir runs south of the Sierra Juarez and includes the peninsula's highest peak, the Picacho del Diablo.
The Sierra de San Borja runs south of the Sierra San Pedro Martir.
The volcanic complex of Tres Virgenes lies in Baja California Sur, near the border with the state of Baja California, forming the ranges south of the Sierra de San Borja.
The Sierra de la Giganta runs along the shore of the Gulf of California south of the Tres Virgenes complex.
At the south end of Baja California Sur, the Sierra de la Laguna forms an isolated mountain range rising to 
Another isolated range, the Sierra Vizcaino, juts out into the Pacific between Punta Eugenia and Punta Abreojos.

The two most prominent capes along the Pacific coastline of the peninsula are Punta Eugenia, located about halfway up the coast, and Cabo San Lazaro, located about a quarter of the way north from Cabo San Lucas.

The Bahia Sebastian Vizcaino, the largest bay in Baja, lies along the Pacific coast halfway up the peninsula.  The large island of Isla Cedros is situated between the bay and the Pacific, just north of Punta Eugenia.  Onshore southeast of the bay is the Desierto de Vizcaino, an extensive desert lying between the Sierra Vizcaino to the west, and the Tres Virgenes range which runs along the Gulf of California to the east.

The largest bays along the coastline of the Gulf are Bahia de La Paz where the city of La Paz is located, and Bahia Concepcion.  The Bahía de los Ángeles is a small bay located west of the Canal de las Ballenas which separates the Baja California peninsula from the large island of Angel de la Guarda in the Gulf of California.

Ecoregions

The peninsula is home to several distinct ecoregions. Most of the peninsula is deserts and xeric shrublands, although pine-oak forests are found in the mountains at the northern and southern ends of the peninsula. The southern tip of the peninsula, which was formerly an island, has many species with affinities to tropical Mexico.
 California chaparral and woodlands, which covers the Mediterranean climate northwestern corner of the peninsula, as well as Cedros and Guadalupe islands.
 Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests in the upper reaches of the Sierra Juárez and Sierra San Pedro Mártir ranges in the northern peninsula.
 The Sonoran Desert extends into the northeastern portion of the state, east of the Sierra Juárez and Sierra San Pedro Mártir ranges.
 The Baja California Desert extends west of the Peninsular Ranges along the Pacific side of the peninsula for most of its length, and includes the El Vizcaíno Desert and El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve.
 The Gulf of California xeric scrub extends along the Gulf of California side of the peninsula for most of its length.
 San Lucan xeric scrub lies in the lowlands of the peninsula's southern tip.
 Sierra de la Laguna dry forests are found on the lower slopes of the Sierra de la Laguna.
 Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests are found at higher elevations in the Sierra de la Laguna.
 The Bahía de los Ángeles Biosphere Reserve

Tourism
The peninsula is known colloquially as Baja by American and Canadian tourists, and is known for its natural environment. It draws ecotourists who go whale watching for migrating California gray whales as well as tourists that arrive to the resorts on the southern tip of the Peninsula. Its location between the North Pacific and Gulf of California give it a reputation for sports fishing.  Since 1967, the peninsula has hosted the Baja 1000, an off road race that begins in Ensenada and ends in La Paz.

94,489,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type9,"Mary Elizabeth Caroline Bartlet (1948 – 11 September 2005) was a Canadian-born musicologist known for her scholarship on French music, and particularly opera, in the 18th and 19th centuries. She also produced pioneering critical editions of the scores for Rossini's Guillaume Tell and Rameau's Platée. At the time of her death she was a professor of music at Duke University and a director of the American Musicological Society.

Life and career
Bartlet was born in Renfrew, Ontario, to  Mary Elizabeth née Dingle and John Coburn Bartlet. She received her BA and MA in Music from the University of Toronto in 1970 and 1972 respectively and began her career as an oboist. She later pursued graduate studies in musicology at the University of Chicago under Philip Gossett. She received her PhD from Chicago in 1982 with a doctoral dissertation on the French composer Étienne Méhul entitled Etienne Nicolas Méhul and opera during the French Revolution, Consulate, and Empire: a source, archival, and stylistic study. In 2005, musicologist David Charlton wrote that it had ""earned itself the iconic status reserved for the few doctoral theses that are destined to change their chosen field."" It was published as a two-volume book in 1999 by Musik-Edition Lucie Galland.

Bartlet began her teaching career at Wilfrid Laurier University while still a student at the University of Chicago. In 1982, she joined the music faculty of Duke University where she remained until her death from cancer in 2005. At the time of her death she was also a director of the American Musicological Society. Shortly after her death the AMS established the ""M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet Fund"", which provides annual grants to doctoral students or graduates of universities in the United States and Canada to conduct musicological research in France.

Works
Bartlet's major scholarly works were Etienne Nicolas Méhul and opera during the French Revolution, Consulate, and Empire: a source, archival, and stylistic study, her 916-page book on the works of Étienne Méhul, and the pioneering critical editions of the scores for Rossini's Guillaume Tell and Rameau's Platée, the latter completed shortly before her death. All were marked by her meticulous and extensive archival research. Her score for Guillaume Tell was premiered at La Scala in 1988 and published by the Fondazione Rossini in 1992 to mark the bicentenary  of the composer's birth. It has subsequently been used for productions at San Francisco Opera, London's Royal Opera House and the International Rossini Festival in Pesaro.

Bartlet's many articles in scholarly journals and books include:
""Politics and the Fate of Roger et Olivier, a Newly Recovered Opera by Grétry"" in Journal of the American Musicological Society (1984). It received the 1984 award for the best article on an eighteenth-century subject from The Southeastern chapter of the American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies
""A musician's view of the French baroque after the advent of Gluck: Grétry's Les trois âges de l'opéra and its context"" in Jean-Baptiste Lully and the music of the French baroque (Cambridge University Press, 1989). It was described in Music & Letters as ""a superb survey of changing musical tastes in France during the eighteenth century""
""From Rossini to Verdi"" in The Cambridge Companion to Grand Opera (Cambridge University Press, 2004). The critic in the Cambridge Opera Journal observed that ""her 93 footnotes and four-page table give a hint at encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject crammed into an awkwardly small space""

Bartlet also wrote the introductions to facsimile scores of Méhul's Mélidore et Phrosine and Stratonice and was the author of numerous articles on French opera of the 18th and 19th centuries in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.

Background 
This conflict took place in a context of tensions between Algeria and Morocco. Morocco became an Ottoman province in 1554 with the help of the Algerians until the return of the Saadian Mohammed ash-Sheikh to power. Following the return of the Saadians, numerous conflicts broke out between Algeria and Morocco, which tried to annex the Algerian city of Tlemcen.

The conflict was initiated when the Moroccan ruler Mohammed ash-Sheikh refused to give allegiance to the Ottomans and the alliance he concluded with the Spaniards. Hasan Pasha, the son of Barbarossa, was named by the Ottoman Empire beylerbey of the Regency of Algiers in June 1557, in order to continue the fight against the Moroccan ruler. He had Mohammed ash-Sheikh assassinated in October 1557 by one of his bodyguards.

Battle 
Hasan Pasha then invaded Morocco in early 1558. An indecisive battle between the two sides took place in Wadi al-Laban to the north of Fez, after which, Hasan Pasha decided to retreat upon hearing of Spanish preparations for an offensive from Oran in Western Algeria. He embarked with his troops at the port of Qassasa in northern Morocco, just west of Melilla, and from there sailed to Algiers to prepare a defense against the Spaniards, who soon attacked in the Mostaganem expedition. Other sources attribute a victory to either Hassan or Abdallah.

Aftermath

Despite his initial opposition against the Ottomans, later during his reign Abdallah al-Ghalib was forced to pay an annual tribute of vassalage to the Ottomans therefore establishing Ottoman influence on the entire Maghreb.

Plot
A year after last seeing her, 31-year-old drug addict Margaret ""Molly"" Wheeler walks to her mother Deb's house remembering times before her fall. She insists that she is ready to be sober and begs her mother to allow her to stay for a few days before going to detox. Deb, although clearly ambivalent about the matter, stands resilient with the support of her husband Chris, fearing that supporting Molly in any way will serve as an enabler. Molly spends the night outside her mother's house and is persistent about her recovery. The next morning a frustrated Deb agrees to take Molly to detox. Upon arrival, it is revealed that Molly has been an addict for over a decade, has lost custody of her children, and is on her 15th attempt at sobriety. Four days after commencing detox, she is offered an opioid antagonist in order to help her on the road to sobriety. However, she must stay off any drugs for an additional four days before it is safe for her to receive the first shot, and then expect an additional shot each month.

On her first day at home, Molly discovers through Deb, many of her misdeeds during her time as an addict, of which Molly clearly regrets. Although at home, Deb remains suspicious of Molly's intentions, but by the end of the day, secretly begins to have hope.

On the second day, Sean, Molly's ex and her children's father, allows her to see them. Although at first reluctant, they are happy to see her and make the most of their time together. She and Deb go grocery shopping, where they see Coach Miller, who invites Molly to speak to her class on drug addiction. Back at home Deb reveals that she was very unhappy with Molly's father Dale, as she felt forced into marriage after becoming pregnant with Molly's older sister Ashley, and thus walking out on the family. Her abandonment is something Molly has always held against Deb, attributing it to her having become an addict. Deb dismisses this, admitting that Dale's implied mental and emotional abuse as the reason for her leaving, much to Molly's surprise.

Molly speaks to Coach Miller's class on the third day home. While speaking to the class, she releases her emotions, is blatant and transparent to the children about her situation and experiences, using the moment to vent. This causes Deb to openly express her optimism and hopes that this time, Molly will finally recover. After, Molly asks that Deb take her to see Sammy, a friend and fellow addict. There, Deb has a chance encounter with Molly's ex-boyfriend Eric, who inadvertently reveals that Molly had been pregnant. Molly later confesses to Deb that she was pregnant, but gave the baby up for adoption. That evening Molly receives a phone call from the detox center seemingly stating that due to issues with her insurance, she cannot get the shot until Monday, adding an additional three days to her wait and thus the fight against her urges. A suspicious Deb questions the call, they argue, and Molly leaves with Sean. 

The additional days become excruciating for Deb as she attempts to contact Molly incessantly to no avail. On Monday morning, Molly arrives at the house urging Deb to get ready so they will not miss her appointment at the detox facility. However, before they leave Molly asks Deb for her urine, confirming Deb's suspicions. Molly further admits that she has relapsed. Despite this, she is adamant that she does wish to get sober, and Deb provides her urine. At the center Molly receives the opioid antagonist shot, but due to her having drugs in her system, she goes into acute withdrawal, and they rush to the hospital.

Four months later, Molly is still living with Deb, visits her children regularly, is getting ready for her next shot, and is on her way to recovery. The film ends with a line about the real life mother and daughter inspirations for the film, Amanda Wendler (Molly) and Libby Alexander (Deb).

History
The genus Acetitomaculum was originally created to describe strains of bacteria isolated from a mature Hereford crossbred steer fed a typical high forage diet. They were isolated in a screen for acetate-producing bacteria extracted from the steer rumen.

Etymology
The name of the genus is derived from the Latin noun acetum, meaning vinegar, combined with the Latin noun tomaculum, a kind of sausage. Together they form Acetitomaculum, literally a kind of vinegar sausage. The name of the type species, A. ruminis is derived from the Latin genitive noun ruminis, meaning ""of the rumen"".

Characteristics
Members of Acetitomaculum are Gram-positive rods which can utilize formate, glucose, and carbon monoxide.

The genus contains a single species, A. ruminis, which is the type species of the genus.

Kerr's parents started the Border Cities Swimming Club in 1930.  At the time it was reportedly the largest swimming club in Canada.  She trained at the club's quarters at Kennedy Collegiate in Windsor.

As a 16-year-old in 1932, she was a member of the Canadian team which finished fourth in the 4x100-metre freestyle relay, swimming the third leg of four in the relay.  The other relay swimmers were Irene Pirie, Betty Edwards, and Betty Mullen.  She also participated in the qualifying heats of the 400-metre freestyle and 100-metre backstroke, but in both she was eliminated in the first round.

Kerr was the first Windsor-born athlete to participate in an Olympic Games.  She was also the youngest member of the 1932 Canadian Olympic Team.  There is a section about Kerr and the Kerr family in Tony Techo's book, The Olympians Among Us.

Kerr was inducted into the Essex Sports Hall of Fame in September 1987.  She worked as a school teacher for many years, and married Robert Todd in 1948.  The couple had four children (Kathy, Kerry, Bobby and Kristy).  On September 21, 2013, Kerr was inducted into the Ontario Aquatic Hall of Fame as a Pioneer Swimmer.  Her oldest daughter, Kathy, made a brief presentation and accepted the award on behalf of the family.  Her second daughter, Kari, attended the induction ceremony, as did her husband and her children.

89,496,2056-7-7 00:00:00,note_type2,"The SeaGlass Carousel is a fish-themed carousel in Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City. The carousel opened to the public on August 20, 2015.

The project to build a carousel was created by Warrie Price, founding president of the Battery Park Conservancy. City officials described the carousel's opening as a symbol of recovery in the area, which suffered damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Part of a plan to redevelop the park, it cost $16 million to build; $8 million of this money was paid for by the city and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. A ride costs $5 and lasts for three-and-a-half minutes. Design and construction took nearly a decade.

The carousel is the work of New York architectural firm WXY and artist George Tsypin.  Music for the ride was created by Teddy Zambetti, a composer and music executive for SiriusXM, who adapted familiar classical themes by Debussy, Mozart, Prokofiev, Ravel, and Saint-Saëns into contemporary styles.  

The carousel features seating on identifiable species, such as a Siamese fighting fish. The carousel is designed to resemble an under-the-sea garden through which visitors ride on fish that appear to be made of sea glass and shimmer as though they were bioluminescent.  The effect refers not only to the carousel's waterfront site, but to nearby Castle Clinton, which housed the New York Aquarium from 1896 until 1941.  The design is also unusual for placing its operating machinery under the floor, so that there is no post in the center of the ride.  A designer from WXY Architecture stated of the carousel, ""As far as we know, there’s nothing in the world like this"".

The majority of Black Canadians are of Caribbean and of continental African origin, though the population also includes  African American immigrants and their descendants (including Black Nova Scotians)

One of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Montreal is Little Burgundy, regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian jazz due to its association with many of Canada's most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, LaSalle, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, and Montréal-Nord have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population.

History

The first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named Mathieu de Costa. Travelling with navigator Samuel de Champlain, de Costa arrived in Nova Scotia some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from Madagascar named Olivier Le Jeune, who may have been of partial Malay ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the French Army and Navy, though some were enslaved or indentured servants.

Marie-Joseph Angélique, a black slave from the Madeira islands who arrived in New France in 1725, was accused of setting the fire that burned down most of Montreal on 10 April 1734, for which she was executed.  Angélique confessed under torture to setting fire to the home of her owner, a Mme Francois Poulin de Francheville, as a way of creating a diversion so she could escape as she did not wish to be separated from her lover, a white servant named Claude Thibault. Angélique believed her owner was going to sell her to the owner of a sugar plantation in the West Indies. Whether this confession was genuine or not continues to divide historians.

Joseph, a black slave who spoke French and English, escaped from his owner in Montreal in 1769. Several other black slaves escaped from the area over the following decades.

Many of Canada's railway porters were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from the South, New York City, and Washington, D.C.  They settled mainly in the major cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, which had major rail connections. In Montreal, they settled primarily in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel.

To combat poverty and social exclusion, the nascent black community of Little Burgundy founded numerous social organizations: the Women's Coloured Club of Montreal in 1902, the Union United Congregational Church in 1907, and the Negro Community Center in 1927. The neighbourhood became famous for producing several talented jazz musicians. During Prohibition and the later pre-Jean Drapeau years as an 'open city,' Little Burgundy was home to many lively nightclubs featuring homegrown and international performers; one of them was Rockhead's Paradise, owned by Rufus Rockhead, after whom a street is named. Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones are the two best-known musicians who emerged from the bebop and post-bop era. By 1996 Little Burgundy, once home to 90 per cent of the city’s Black residents, was now home to only 2 per cent of all Blacks in Montreal.

In 1968 the Sir George Williams affair occurred as a result of racist policies at Sir George Williams University.

West Indian women, from both the Francophone and Anglophone Caribbean, came to Montreal after the Domestic Immigration Program of 1955 was established. Most settled in Little Burgundy.

Canada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial requirements were eliminated from Canadian immigration laws. This coincided with a wave of decolonization in the Caribbean.  Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans came from that region, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. Today's Black Canadians are largely of Caribbean origin, with some of recent African origin, and smaller numbers from the United States, Europe and Latin America.

In 1977, between 1,200 and 2,400 Black Nova Scotians lived in Montreal. Though dispersed throughout the city, many settled among African-Americans and English-speaking West Indians in Little Burgundy.

Montreal's Haitian community of 100,000 people is the largest in Canada. Large percentages of Haitians live in Montréal-Nord,
Saint-Michel and R.D.P. Today, Haitian Creole is the sixth most spoken language in Montreal and the seventh most spoken language in the province of Quebec.

Culture
Carifiesta () is an annual Caribbean Carnival held in Montreal. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent.

The Montreal Black Film Festival is held annually.

Black Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, R&B, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Some of the earliest musical influences include Oliver Jones, Oscar Peterson and Charlie Biddle.

Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of creating a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture. For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.

Black Canadian settlementsThe culo'e puya drums, also known as culoepuya, culo e puya, or culepuya, are a battery of small drums originally from Venezuela, with a Kongo lineage. They are used in an ensemble also known as redondo drums, after the dance motion and the circle which forms around the dancers during performance.

Organology

The culo'e puya battery comprises three drums made of lightweight wood from the tree known locally as lano or ceiba de lana (Ceiba pentandra, a member of the Bombacaceae family, to which Balsa also belongs). Both ends have skin heads, which are joined with tensors made of rope (nylon rope is commonly used today). The drums are roughly 1.5 m (4 ft.) in length and between 10 and 15 cm (4-6 inches) in diameter.

The inside of the drum is carved in the shape of an hourglass, instead of a cylinder.

There are three different diameters, each corresponding to a distinct ""voice"" or pattern. The different diameters are known as:

Prima - The smallest. Also called hembra (female) or quitimba or quichimba (a word of probable African origin, but whose exact meaning has been lost).
Cruzao - The middle diameter drum. The name means ""hybrid"" or ""crossed"".
Pujao - The largest diameter. Also called macho (male). The word pujao is a vernacular misspelling of the past participle of the verb pujar, which means to struggle, to push, or (colloquially, in South America) to moan as a result of extreme effort.

Playing technique
Redondo drums are held between the player's legs and played with a stick in one hand and the fingers of the other (bare) hand. There are six basic strokes:

Open stroke with bare hand.
Closed stroke with bare hand's fingertips.
Bass stroke with the heel of the bare hand.
Open stroke with stick on drum head.
Closed stroke with stick on drum head.
Side stick.

Rhythms

Culo'e Puya drums are typical of the Barlovento region of North-central Venezuela. They are most commonly used in the festivities of the Summer Solstice/St. John the Baptist (June 24) as part of the Redondo ensemble, which also includes one or two maracas, voice and hand claps. The redondo players accompany the processions dedicated to St. John and play alongside it in an ensemble often called tambor pequeño or (small drum), to distinguish it from another battery of drums used during the St. John festivities, known as tambor grande (large drum), or Mina.

The basic pattern is usually notated in  or  time signatures. Each town in Barlovento has a unique way of interpreting the basic pattern and adds its own local variation, but in general, the prima carries the base of the rhythm and it is played on the upbeats, while the pujao improvises and the cruzao marks the downbeats. This contrasts with the role of the conga drums in the Cuban rumba, where the smallest drum is the soloist.

The pujao improvisations are centered on a set pattern, but they can achieve an impressive degree of variety when the percussionist is able to tune the drum while performing. This maneuver is considerably difficult, and it is based on the bass stroke to tune the drum down and a series of side hits to the edge of the drum head with the heel of the bare hand to tune the drum back up.

The Barlovento towns of Curiepe, Tacarigüita, La Boca and Mendoza still maintain the tradition of the Culo'e Puya, but their sound and unique rhythm has influenced the rest of the native forms of Venezuelan music.

Commercial recordings featuring the culo'e puya
The American jazz composer Henry Threadgill featured two culo'e puya players on his 1993 album Too Much Sugar for a Dime.
Cuban pianist Omar Sosa included the sound of culo'e puyas in his release entitled Sentir.

He studied medicine in Berlin, and later became an assistant at the pathological institute in Halle. In 1881 he became a professor of pathological anatomy in Giessen, and two years later garnered the same position at Marburg. In 1900 he succeeded pathologist Felix Victor Birch-Hirschfeld (1842-1899) at the University of Leipzig.

In 1904 Marchand is credited with coining the term atherosclerosis from the Greek ""athero"", meaning gruel, and ""sclerosis"", meaning hardening, to describe the fatty substance inside a hardened artery. His name is lent to the eponymous ""Marchand's adrenals"", which is accessory adrenal tissue in the broad ligament of the uterus. 

Among his written works was a 4-volume textbook on pathology that he co-authored with Ludolf von Krehl (1861-1937), called ""Handbuch der allgemeinen Pathologie"".

91,499,2054-5-5 00:00:00,note_type3,"Charlotte Sutherland was born at Caron Point, near present-day Bathurst, New Brunswick in 1799, the daughter of James, an English settler. At the age of 20, she travelled overland in mid-winter to Fredericton, a distance of 250 km, to save the family farm from repossession by the province.

Background

James Sutherland, an Englishman of Scottish descent, and his wife arrived in Boston around 1786, shortly after the cessation of the American Revolution.  He assaulted a Yankee in a heated political discussion between the two, whereupon the other man challenged him to a duel. He accepted, and then won the duel, killing the man in the process. Because of this murder, his life was in forfeit to justice and so the couple fled to Saint John, New Brunswick, and thence to the wilderness of the North Shore near present-day Bathurst, where he could settle into obscurity.  Sutherland was leased for 999 years at a rate of three peppercorns a year a large tract of land near Caron or Belloni Point. It was there that were born Charlotte  and her brother Frederick, four years younger.

Foreclosure averted

Because of the notions of British freedom particular to the colonial era, the British legal system had resolved to grant land directly to the subjects of the Crown, as compared to the French system of seignories, in which the settlers were subject to overlords.  One price of this freedom was that the Crown granted land subject to the condition that it be deforested ploughed and cropped, as opposed to accumulated and hoarded.  On information to a magistrate—sometimes by a jealous neighbor—hoarded land might be reclaimed by the Crown.

The Sutherland family appears to have fallen behind on its labour, and somehow was notified in 1818 that a procedure to remove their grant from them had begun.  The escheat and re-grant to another depended on a paperchase in Fredericton.

It was thus that Charlotte and her brother were prompted to trek overland to Fredericton, snowshoed and in the midst of winter.  They arrived in record time, only eight days after they had started.  At the time, there were no houses between the Nepisiguit and the Miramichi, so the siblings were forced to sleep under spruce boughs while in the region.  Between Newcastle and Fredericton they occasionally found shelter at farmhouses or at taverns.

The Sutherlands were not without acumen. The deed of grant was vague and failed to stipulate by whom would be performed the requisite improvements; evidently for example, to hire help was allowed.  In addition, the deed specified that the land and everything on it belonged to the grantee.  Charlotte saw that the beavers, who were considered normally to be nuisances, had in fact deforested the land next to their ponds, and built bridges besides.

Justice and Lieutenant-Governor George Stracey Smyth bent their ears to the strength of this argument, and so the Sutherland grant was saved by the pluck and determination of Charlotte.

Legacy

Charlotte's younger brother Frederick had issue, with wife Mary Ann, of Augustus Skinner on 5 November 1835. It is unknown what happened to James and Charlotte, or the family tract that was leased to James by a Hugh Sutherland, one of the three original landowners of the area that was eventually to become the city of Bathurst.
